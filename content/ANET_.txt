arista networks pioneered datadriven cognitive cloud networking for largescale data center and campus workspace environments at the core of aristas platform is an advanced network operating system aristas extensible operating system eos combined with a set of network and ethernet switching and routing platforms based on merchant silicon we are a leader in cloud networking solutions delivering high performance scalability availability programmability automation and visibility 

in recent years we have brought the operational consistency and principles of cloud networking to the broader enterprise and campus markets with our cognitive cloud networking approach extending eos across the enterprise data center and campus wired and wireless workspace cloudvision® our workload orchestration and automation solution leverages eos based network wide data models to deliver turnkey automation and configuration capabilities across data center wired and wireless workspaces multicloud and wan routing use cases 

in 2020 we completed the acquisition of big switch networks a pioneer in network monitoring software and awake security an aidriven network detection and response ndr company we believe the integration of these capabilities with arista’s networkwide databased visibility and telemetry offerings delivers the next generation of operationally efficient network security and visibility solutions 

in addition we continued to expand our 400g product portfolio for both enterprise and cloud customers with the introduction of the next generation 7050x7060x and 7300x series switches delivering performance and cost benefits for customers of all sizes as they transition to 400g we also continue to expand our cognitive campus edge portfolio with the new c360 wifi 6e access point to take advantage of the greater capacity higher bandwidth and lower latency of wifi 6e 

since we began shipping our products we have grown rapidly and according to market research we have achieved the second largest market share in data center ethernet switch ports and revenue excluding china we have been profitable and cash flow positive for each year since 2010 

we sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others 

our market opportunity 

we compete primarily in the data center switching market for 10 gigabit ethernet and above excluding blade switches we added advanced routing capabilities to our rseries switches which in addition to switching address the data center interconnect dci market cloudgrade routing nextgeneration network edge and parts of the wide area networking routing market we also compete in the enterprise campus market for 1 gigabit ethernet switching and above and in the cloudmanaged wireless networking market in addition our acquisitions of big switch networks and awake security enhance our ability to address a portion of the network monitoring and ndr security markets 

we believe that cloud computing represents a fundamental shift from traditional legacy network architectures as organizations of all sizes have moved workloads to the cloud spending on cloud and nextgeneration data centers has increased rapidly while traditional legacy it spending has grown more slowly 

our customers 

as of december 31 2021 we had delivered our cloud networking solutions to over 8000 end customers worldwide our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 purchases by microsoft accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue 

cloud networking and digital transformation market drivers 

digital transformation is fundamentally changing the way it infrastructure is built and how applications are delivered from a cloud environment in cloud computing applications are distributed across thousands of servers these servers are connected with highspeed network switches that together form a pool of resources that allows applications to be rapidly deployed and costeffectively updated cloud computing enables ubiquitous and ondemand network access to these applications from internetconnected devices including personal computers tablets internet of things iot devices and smartphones 

nearly all consumer applications today are delivered as cloud services enterprise applications are rapidly moving to the cloud as cloud services are easier and more cost effective to deploy scale and operate than traditional applications internet leaders like amazon meta platforms google and microsoft pioneered the development of largescale cloud data centers in order to meet the growing demands of their users including business customers enterprises and service providers around the world are adopting cloud computing technologies in order to achieve similar performance improvements and cost reductions 

the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can be orders of magnitude higher than typical legacy data center networks therefore the networks in such cloud environments must be architected and built in a new way we refer to these nextgeneration data center networks as cloud networks cloud networks must deliver high capacity high availability and predictable performance and must be programmable to allow integration with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services 

examples of key secular trends driving network transformation are illustrated below 

limitations of traditional enterprise data center and campus networks 

we believe that cloud networks and legacy networks are fundamentally different in a traditional data center specific applications are installed on a small number of servers and most network traffic is servertoclient or “northsouth” traffic which results in perhaps a few terabitssecond of aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud most network traffic is servertoserver or “eastwest” traffic the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can exceed 1 petabitsecond orders of magnitude higher than that of typical legacy data center networks 

the much larger scale of cloud networks requires much higher network availability since network outages in the cloud are costly to customers traditional network switches have evolved and the features and capabilities of their operating system have expanded over many years without addressing the structural deficiencies of their underlying software architectures making it difficult to achieve high network switch reliability 

some networking vendors have built products that use proprietary protocols to address the scaling needs of nextgeneration data centers however proprietary protocols are generally disfavored by internet companies or cloud service providers because they create vendor lockin 

legacy enterprise networks are generally not programmable and as a result are extremely difficult to integrate with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services this lack of integration forces customers to continue to rely on time consuming errorprone manual processes that may be costprohibitive 

traditional enterprise wired and wireless campus networks must cope with an everincreasing number of endpoint iot devices for users to be connected anywhere campus administrators have sought to address the resulting increased network complexities and bottlenecks through the adoption of a myriad of platforms operating systems proprietary features and network management tools coupled with the explosive growth of iot and the requirement for workloads the operational costs of managing these complexities have become prohibitive 

our cloud networking solutions 

the core of aristas platform is an advanced network operating system aristas eos which was designed to be fully programmable modular and reliable the programmability of eos has allowed us to expand our software applications to address the everincreasing demands of cloud networking including data driven workflow automation network visibility analytics and network detection and response and has further allowed us to integrate rapidly with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services 

an overview of our cloud networking solutions is shown below 

the key benefits of our cloud networking solutions are as follows 

capacity performance and scalability 

our cloud networking platform enables data center networks to scale to hundreds of thousands of physical servers and millions of virtual machines with the least number of switching tiers we achieve this by leveraging standard protocols to meet the scale requirements of cloud computing we have used activeactive layer 2 and layer 3 network topologies to enable customers to build extremely large and resilient networks 

high availability 

our highly modular eos software architecture was designed to be faultisolating and selfhealing in order to deliver higher availability compared to legacy network operating systems in addition our customers can nondisruptively upgrade our switches running in the network using our smart system upgrade ssu application without interrupting the network service 

open and programmable 

our eos software was purposebuilt to offer programmable interfaces throughout all levels of our software this has allowed us to integrate our cloud networking platform with a wide range of leading thirdparty applications for example we support vmware nsx openconfigyang and microsoft system center for orchestration and fast provisioning enabling true workload mobility and automatic provisioning of physical switches we enable customers through application programming interfaces apis to write their own scripts to customize and optimize their networks 

workflow automation 

our eos software enables enterprises to provision networking resources in minutes with no manual intervention through our zero touch provisioning we also natively support ansible cfengine chef puppet virtual network orchestration applications and thirdparty management tools cloudvision a networkwide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation delivers a turnkey solution to enterprises looking to modernize their data centers for cloud networking cloudvision extends the same eos architectural approach across the network for state topology monitoring and visibility this enables enterprises to move to cloudclass automation without needing significant internal development finally eos embraces the devops model which is a software development method that combines development and operations to provision and monitor servers storage and network resources in a unified fashion 

network visibility 

our eos software provides a set of tools and applications that proactively monitor detect and notify network managers when network issues arise delivering realtime data to thirdparty network performance and security applications to provide detailed application visibility our network visibility applications provide realtime insight into the status of the network 

through the integration of dataanalyzer danz features native to arista switches with big switch’s monitoring software we provide the danz monitoring fabric dmf dmf delivers network traffic analysis data analytics and contextual insights to enterprises looking for networkwide observability 

security 

macrosegmentation services mss tm  is one of the services enabled via cloudvision since cloudvision maintains a networkwide database of all states within the network as well as direct integration with hypervisor resources like vmware vsphere and nsx macrosegmentation extends the concept of finegrained interhypervisor security to cloud networks by enabling dynamic security and services for physical to virtual workloads and is a complement to finegrained security delivered via microsegmentation that is already implemented in the virtual switch of the physical host on which a vm is running 

arista network detection and response ndr is an advanced solution that delivers answers not alerts by combining artificial intelligence with human expertise arista ndr autonomously hunts for both insider and external attacker behaviors while providing triage digital forensics and incident response across the entire network — campus workspace data center iotot and cloud networks 

lower total cost of ownership 

our cloud networking platform offers architectural and system advantages that provide our customers with costeffective and highly available cloud networking solutions we believe our programmable scalable leafspine architectures combined with our applications significantly reduce networking costs when compared to legacy network designs enabling faster time to service and improved availability our automation tools reduce the operational costs of provisioning managing and monitoring a data center network and speed up service delivery our visibility tools provide high levels of visibility into complex network environments without the need for additional data collection equipment as a result this lowers operational costs because fewer network engineers are needed to operate large networks 

cognitive campus workspace 

arista’s solutions apply the principles of cognitive cloud computing to campus networks with the intent of disrupting the wasteful oversubscribed legacy threetier architecture of accessaggregationcore as the devices move to more disparate iot for voice video and data traffic arista is addressing these trends in the campus network by using cognitive controls and analytics driven by a singleimage operating system that extends across the campus and the data center 

using a cloudbased approach reduces operational costs by incorporating a network that is a seamless endtoend solution rather than silos of different places in the network arista’s cognitive campus workspace is a datadriven model coupled with our unified dashboard for wiredwireless edge for next gen zero touch campus deployments together with zero trust security the cognitive campus drives multifaceted visibility for internet of things iot and operational technology ot applications 

our cognitive campus networking solutions are based on three principles 

universal cloud network  we offer our universal cloud network as an alternative to brittle proprietary solutions from legacy vendors our universal cloud network is an open standardsbased design focusing on softwaredriven control principles our collapsed spline™ approach consolidates traditional campus core and aggregation layers into a simple single tier with high availability 

cognitive management plane  there is a void in management plane consistency and a need for datadriven analytics in the campus as in the data center we believe that a common model can be applied across both footprints saving customers operational costs the cognitive management plane cmp is a datadriven repository for the automated actions across network analytics 

securing the campus  securing the campus requires a holistic approach to network segmentation device compliance and auditing as well as service integration with our security partners we deliver these capabilities through eos dmf ndr and cloudvision

arista acare services 

we have designed our customer support offerings arista acare services to provide our customers with high levels of support our global team of support engineers engages directly with client it teams and is available at all times over email by phone or through our website 

we offer multiple service options that allow our customers to select the product replacement service level that best meets their needs we stock spare parts in over 200 locations around the world through our thirdparty logistics suppliers all of our service options include unlimited access to bugfixes newfeaturereleases online case management and our community forums 

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our products through our direct sales force and in partnership with our channel partners including distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators and original equipment manufacturer oem partners we also sell in conjunction with various technology partners to facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity we have created a partner program the arista partner program to engage partners who provide valueadded services and extend our reach into the marketplace authorized training partners perform technical training of our channel partners and end customers our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us 

our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for presales technical support and solutions engineering for our end customers systems integrators oems and channel partners a pool of shared channel sales and marketing representatives also supports these teams each sales team is responsible for a geographical territory has responsibility for a number of major direct endcustomer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market 

our marketing activities consist primarily of technology conferences web marketing trade shows product demonstrations seminars and events public relations analyst relations demand generation and direct marketing to build our brand increase endcustomer awareness communicate our product advantages and generate qualified leads for our field sales force and channel partners 

seasonality 

our rapid historical growth may have reduced the impact of seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date as our increasing size may cause our growth rate to slow seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we operate on a december 31st yearend and have typically experienced higher sequential product revenue growth in the fourth quarter followed by flattodeclining sequential growth in the first quarter of the following year we believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors including the procurement budgeting and deployment cycles of many of our end customers in addition the current industrywide supply chain shortages and extended lead times and their impact on our ability to ship products to our customers in a timely manner may disrupt typical seasonal trends 

research and development 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and features that address the needs of our end customers our inhouse engineering personnel are responsible for the development quality documentation support and release of our products we plan to continue to invest in resources to conduct our research and development efforts 

manufacturing 

we subcontract the manufacturing of all of our products to various contract manufacturers our primary manufacturing partners are jabil circuit and sanmina corporation this approach allows us to reduce our costs manufacturing overhead and inventory position and allows us to adjust more quickly to changing endcustomer demand we require all of our manufacturing locations to be iso9001 certified we have four direct fulfillment facilities worldwide to hold finished goods inventory perform product transformations and install our eos software to ship to customers and partners 

our contract manufacturing partners procure the majority of the components needed to build our products and assemble our products according to our design specifications this allows us to leverage the purchasing power of our contract manufacturing partners we retain complete control over the bill of materials test procedures and quality assurance programs our personnel work closely with our partners and review on an ongoing basis forecasts inventory levels processes capacity yields and overall quality our contract manufacturing partners procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts these forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analyses from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions for example current industrywide supply chain shortages have resulted in extended lead times for components and have required us to extend the time horizon of our demand forecasts 

our products rely on key components including merchant silicon integrated circuit components and power supplies purchased from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers we also expect to see increased consolidation among our component suppliers generally neither we nor our contract manufacturers have a written agreement with these component providers to guarantee the supply of the key components used in our products nor do we have exclusive rights to such key components and our suppliers could suffer shortages delay shipments prioritize shipments to other vendors increase prices or cease manufacturing such products or selling them to us at any time the supply of components may also be adversely affected by geopolitical conditions such as international trade wars like the us trade war with china and the impact of public health epidemics like the coronavirus 

our product development efforts also depend upon continued collaboration with our key suppliers including our merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors it is critical that we work in tandem with our key merchant silicon vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features this enables us to focus our research and development resources on software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions 

once the completed products are manufactured and tested our contract manufacturing partners ship them to various direct fulfillment facilities in the united states the netherlands and singapore for final configuration 

qualitycontrol inspection and shipment to our distribution partners and end customers after the products are shipped to our end customers our products are installed by the end customers or by thirdparty service providers such as system integrators or valueadded resellers on their behalf 

competition 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and characterized by rapidlychanging technology changing endcustomer needs evolving industry standards frequent introductions of new products and services and industry consolidation we expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for cloud networking expands and existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products 

the data center and campus networking markets have been historically dominated by cisco with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including extreme networks dellemc hewlett packard enterprise and juniper networks most of our competitors and some strategic alliance partners have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example broadcom acquired brocade communications systems extreme networks purchased certain data center networking assets from broadcombrocade and avaya as well as aerohive networks dell acquired emc hewlett packard enterprise acquired aruba networks and juniper networks acquired mist systems 

we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants current technology partners and end customers who may acquire or develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products to market and sell to customers some of these competitors are developing networking products based on offtheshelf or commoditized hardware technology or “white box” hardware particularly where an end customer’s network strategy seeks to emphasize deployment of such product offerings or adopt a disaggregated approach to the procurement of hardware and software end customers may also increase their adoption of networking solutions based upon opensource network operating systems that may be provided for free and used either on “white box” or proprietary hardware the entrance of new competitors into our markets or the increased adoption of these new technology solutions or consumption models may cause downward pricing pressures result in lost sales or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

in the ndr market our arista ndr offerings compete with other network security vendors including cisco darktrace and extrahop lastly in the network packet broker npb market arista danz monitoring fabric competes with gigamon keysight and other network monitoring software providers 

our relationships with our strategic alliance partners or suppliers may also shift as industry dynamics change if strategic alliance partners acquire or develop competitive products or services our relationship with those partners may be adversely impacted which could lead to more variability to our results of operations and impact the pricing of our solutions 

the principal competitive factors applicable to our products include 

• breadth of product offerings and features 

• reliability and product quality 

• ease of use 

• pricing 

• total cost of ownership including automation monitoring and integration costs 

• performance and scale 

• programmability and extensibility 

• interoperability with other products 

• ability to be bundled with other vendor offerings and 

• quality of service support and fulfillment 

we believe our products compete favorably with respect to these factors our eos software offers high reliability integrates with existing network protocols and is open and programmable we believe the combination of eos a set of network applications and our 125510254050100400 gigabit ethernet platforms make our offering highly competitive for both cloud and enterprise data centers however many of our competitors have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger sales and marketing budgets and resources broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and end customers greater access to larger endcustomer bases greater endcustomer support resources greater manufacturing resources the ability to leverage their sales efforts across a broader portfolio of products the ability to leverage purchasing power when purchasing subcomponents the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services the ability to develop their own silicon chips the ability to set more aggressive pricing policies lower labor and development costs greater resources to make acquisitions larger intellectual property portfolios and substantially greater financial technical research and development or other resources 

in addition in the current industrywide supply constrained environment the ability to source components and provide customers with product in a timely manner can result in a significant competitive advantage while we have extended our demand planning horizons and increased our component purchase commitments there is no guarantee that suppliers will meet their commitments or that ultimate customer demand will directly match our demand forecasts 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our core technology and intellectual property we rely on patent trademark and copyright laws trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees end customers resellers systems integrators manufacturers and others to protect our intellectual property rights we file us and foreign patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products patents generally have a duration of twenty years from filing the remaining duration on the individual patents in our patent portfolio varies 

we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of valuable breadth or applicability in addition any patents that may be issued may be contested circumvented found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them we also license software from third parties for integration into our products including opensource software and other software available on commerciallyreasonable terms we own a number of trademarks in the us and other jurisdictions including arista eos cloudvision cloudstream cvp cvx health tracer mapreduce tracer path tracer mxp mss rail score spline superspine ssu flexroute netrollback netdb osfp algomatch macrosegmentation and macrosegmentation service 

we control access to and use of our software technology and other proprietary information through internal and external controls including contractual protections with employees contractors end customers and partners our software is protected by us and international copyright patent and trade secret laws despite our efforts to protect our software technology and other proprietary information unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software technology and other proprietary information in addition we intend to expand our international operations and effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights if we become more successful we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights it may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights in particular large and established companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation from time to time third parties including certain of these large companies and nonpracticing entities may assert patent copyright trademark and 

other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our end customers whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against such claims 

successful claims of infringement by a thirdparty if any could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services require us to expend time and money to develop noninfringing solutions or force us to pay substantial damages royalties or other fees we cannot assure that we do not currently infringe or that we will not in the future infringe upon any thirdparty patents or other proprietary rights

risks related to our business and industry 

the covid19 pandemic which has led among other things to manufacturing disruptions supply chain shortages and unpredictable product demand and supply extended demand planning horizons and increased purchase commitments could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the covid19 pandemic has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on the business operations of our company and our customers partners manufacturers suppliers distribution fulfillment centers and service depots the vast majority of our employees continue to work from home and this remote model could present operational and other workplace challenges over time that may affect our business we have also experienced and may continue to experience manufacturing and supply chain disruptions components shortages increased component lead times unpredictability of supply logistic challenges and increased costs 

our contract manufacturers in malaysia mexico and the united states are impacted by the pandemic and have experienced shelter in place orders workforce disruptions delays and increased costs for production transit and the import and export of products while our contract manufacturers have made progress to minimize disruptions caused by covid19 governments are continuing to impose restrictions on access as a result of covid19 variants which has negatively impacted the staffing and product output of our contract manufacturers our contract manufacturers’ activities are further limited by supply constraints caused by disruptions in the manufacturing activities of our suppliers similar to our manufacturing facilities our direct fulfillment centers and service depots continue to operate with varying degrees of government restriction on access which can materially impact our ability to ship products or provide support services to our customers as a result of covid19 related manufacturing disruptions the lead times for our products have increased and our supply chain costs have increased which has and may continue to adversely impact our gross margins in addition we have had to increase our demand planning horizon to address supply chain shortages combined with increased component lead times and unpredictability of supply resulting in significant increases to our purchase commitments and component buffer inventories there is however no guarantee that suppliers will meet their commitments or that customers actual demand will directly match our demand forecasts and this has increased the risk of future excess and obsolete inventory and could have a negative impact on our gross margins 

as the covid19 pandemic continues we have experienced and may continue to experience additional risks including 

• more manufacturing disruptions and supply shortages including shortages in semiconductors 

• increased lead times for our products including longer lead times for component parts incorporated into our products which in turn can increase the risk of order cancellations 

• reduced capacity and output at factories and factory closures 

• disruptions in logistics which impact the movement of components and finished products 

• overall increased demand for materials which could result in a limited or unpredictable supply of materials and components that are incorporated in our products 

• delays in product shipments and limits on our ability to provide inperson support services to customers and 

• increased risk of future excess and obsolete inventory as we extend our demand planning horizon and increase our purchase commitments and our inventory buffers 

the covid19 pandemic could limit our ability to add new customers and cause sales disruptions order cancellations longer upgrade cycles by customers for network equipment and overall lower demand for our products and services customers may purchase products in advance of their internal demand which could result in lower purchases in subsequent quarters in addition given supply chain constraints customers may give us more optimistic indications about prospective purchases which could result in lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders we could also face increased risk of customer defaults and delays in payment 

in addition the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the global economy and financial markets which may result in an extended economic slowdown or a global recession that could adversely impact our business due to the uncertainty around the duration of the pandemic the impact of new variants of 

covid19 the availability distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments for covid19 around the world the imposition of public safety measures the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and the impact of covid19 on our customers partners contract manufacturers and supply chain we are unable to predict the full impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations and financial performance in addition the covid19 pandemic and the various responses to it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks discussed in this “risk factors” section 

the networking market is rapidly evolving if this market does not evolve as we anticipate or our target end customers do not adopt our networking solutions we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the growth and evolution of the networking market the market demand for networking solutions has increased in recent years as end customers have deployed larger more sophisticated networks and have increased the use of virtualization and cloud computing the continued growth of this market will be dependent upon many factors including but not limited to the adoption of and demand for our end customers’ products and services the expansion evolution and build out of our end customers’ networks the capacity utilization of existing network infrastructures changes in the technological requirements for the products and services to be deployed in these networks the amount and mix of capital spending by our end customers the development of network switches and cloud service solutions by our large end customers for internal use the financial performance and prospects of our end customers the availability of capital resources to our end customers changes in government regulation that could impact networking business models including those regulations related to cybersecurity privacy data protection and net neutrality our ability to provide networking solutions that address the needs of end customers more effectively and economically than those of other competitors or existing technologies and general economic conditions including the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

if the networking solutions market does not develop in the way we anticipate or otherwise experiences a slowdown if our solutions do not offer benefits compared to competing networking products or if end customers do not recognize the benefits that our solutions provide then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

we pursue new product and service offerings and expand into adjacent markets and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we have made substantial investments to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts to expand our product offerings and maintain our revenue growth if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products and services in a timely and costeffective manner if we fail to introduce products and services that meet market demand or if we do not successfully expand into adjacent markets we may lose our competitive position our products may become obsolete and our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected for example as we introduce our 400 gbe and 800 gbe products our ability to continue to maintain our competitive position with our customers will depend on our ability to deliver these new products in a timely manner and our customers acceptance of these products in addition the evaluation testing and qualification of our new products by our customers may be lengthy and may require contractual acceptance clauses which could delay our revenue recognition and impact our revenue and deferred revenue balances 

additionally from time to time we invest in expansion into adjacent markets including campus switching wifi networking and network security markets although we believe these solutions are complementary to our current offerings we have less experience and a more limited operating history in these markets and our efforts in this area may not be successful expanding our services in existing and new markets and increasing the depth and breadth of our presence imposes significant burdens on our marketing compliance and other administrative and managerial resources our plan to expand and deepen our market share in our existing markets and possibly expand into additional markets is subject to a variety of risks and challenges our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors including but not limited to our ability to develop new products new product features and services that address the customer requirements for these markets attract a customer base in markets in which we have less experience compete with new and existing competitors in these adjacent markets and gain market acceptance of our new products 

developing our products is expensive and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle we expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform and introduce new products and features we expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these investments these investments may take several years to generate positive returns if ever 

additionally future market share gains may take longer than planned and cause us to incur significant costs if we are unable to attract new large end customers or to sell additional products and services to our existing end customers our revenue growth will be adversely affected and our revenue could decrease difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our revenue and our revenue growth rates are volatile and may decline 

our revenue growth rate in previous periods may not be indicative of our future performance we have experienced annual revenue growth rates of 272 39 121 and 307 in 2021 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively in the future our revenue growth rates may continue to be volatile as we become more penetrated in our existing customer base and product markets and as we look to enter and expand into new markets in addition covid19 related disruptions may cause delays in product shipments or cancellation of orders by end customers and could have a negative impact on demand from our customers in future periods and on our ability to add new customers other factors may also contribute to declines in our growth rates including changes in demand for our products and services particularly from our large end customers changes in capital spending by our large end customers increased competition price sensitivities from our customers to increases in our pricing our ability to successfully manage our expansion or continue to capitalize on growth opportunities the maturation of our business general economic and international trade conditions and our ability to be successful in adjacent markets such as campus switching wifi networking markets and network security markets for example we have experienced volatility in demand from certain of our large end customers overall demand from larger customers may decline in future periods which would impact our future revenue growth you should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected and our stock price could be volatile 

our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors or our previously issued financial guidance or if any forwardlooking financial guidance does not meet the expectation of analysts or investors the market price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our results of operations have historically varied from period to period and we expect that this trend will continue as a result you should not rely upon our past financial results for any period as indicators of future performance our results of operations in any given period can be influenced by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict including 

• the disruption caused by covid19 and the government restrictions in response to the pandemic 

• our inability to fulfill our end customers’ orders or the cancellation of orders by our end customers due to the unavailability or unpredictable supply of inventory supply chain delays access to key commodities or technologies manufacturing disruptions or other events that impact our manufacturers or their suppliers 

• deferral reduction or cancellation of orders from end customers due to long lead times announcements by us or other competitors of new products or product enhancements warranty returns or other factors 

• our ability to increase sales to existing customers and attract new end customers including large end customers 

• the budgeting sales implementation and refresh cycles purchasing practices and buying patterns of end customers including large end customers who may receive lower pricing terms due to volume discounts and who may or may not make large bulk purchases in certain quarters or who may elect to reassign allocations to multiple vendors based upon specific network roles or projects 

• changes in the growth rate of existing or new customers including large end customers and service providers changes in endcustomer distributor or reseller requirements or market needs and changes in growth rates of the networking market 

• the cost and potential outcomes of existing and future litigation 

• increased expenses resulting from increases in material or component costs and production costs including as a result of shortages in supply for semiconductors or the tariffs imposed by the us on goods from other 

countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on us goods including the tariffs implemented by the us government on various imports from china 

• changes in our pricing policies whether initiated by us or as a result of competition 

• the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operation and expansion of our business 

• difficulty forecasting budgeting and planning due to limited visibility beyond the first two quarters into the spending plans of current or prospective customers 

• the inclusion of any acceptance provisions in our customer contracts or any delays in acceptance of those products 

• the actual or rumored timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry including consolidation among our competitors or end customers 

• our ability to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally 

• our ability to increase the size and production of our sales or distribution channel or any disruption in or termination of our sales or distribution channels 

• decisions by potential end customers to purchase our networking solutions from larger more established vendors white box vendors or their primary network equipment vendors 

• insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our end customers which could adversely affect their ability to purchase or pay for our products and services or confronting our key suppliers including our sole source suppliers which could disrupt our supply chain 

• seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets 

• future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies 

• our overall effective tax rate including impacts caused by any reorganization in our corporate structure any changes in our valuation allowance for domestic deferred tax assets and any new legislation or regulatory developments 

• increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as an increasing portion of our expenses are incurred and paid in currencies other than the us dollar 

• general economic conditions both domestically and in foreign markets and disruptions in our business and the markets due to among other things health epidemics natural disasters terrorism and other catastrophic events including international trade wars involving the us and china and the political tensions in russia europe and asia 

• increases in cybersecurity threats including security threats from state sponsors and 

• other risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k 

any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of several of the factors described above may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other results of operations and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our revenue gross margins results of operations or other expectations contained in any forward looking financial guidance we have issued or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for a particular period if we fail to meet or exceed such guidance or expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our common stock could decline substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits in the past we have failed to meet investor financial expectations and the market price of our common stock declined 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and may be adversely affected by numerous factors 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and the gross margins we have achieved in recent years may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including but not limited to changes in endcustomer geographic or product mix increased price competition introduction of new products and new business models including the sale and delivery of more software and subscription solutions increases in material or component costs and production costs including as a result of shortages in supply for semiconductors and other components entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets entry in markets with different pricing and cost structures pricing discounts given to customers costs associated with defending intellectual property infringement and other claims and the potential outcomes of such disputes higher levels of excess or obsolete inventory and inventory holding charges as a result of extended demand planning horizons due to industrywide supply shortage changes in shipment volumes the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals increased costs arising from tariffs increased costs arising from epidemics changes in distribution channels increased warranty costs and our ability to execute our operating plans in addition inflationary pressures and shortages have increased and we expect will continue to increase costs for certain materials components supplies and services if these effects continue for a prolonged period or result in sustained economic stress or recession many of the risk factors identified in this risk factors section could be heightened we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quarter to quarter failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

interruptions or delays in shipments could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

we have been and could continue to be subject to manufacturing disruptions and supply chain delays this places significant pressure on supply chain management manufacturing inventory and quality control management shipping and trade compliance to ensure that we have properly forecasted supply purchasing manufacturing capacity inventory and quality compliance and logistics a significant interruption in these critical functions could result in delayed order fulfillment adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

because some of the components in our products come from sole or limited sources of supply we have increased our purchase commitments and are susceptible to supply shortages extended lead times or supply changes which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers and may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

our products rely on components including merchant silicon chips integrated circuit components printed circuit boards connectors customtooled sheet metal and power supplies that we purchase or our contract manufacturers purchase on our behalf from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers generally we do not have guaranteed supply contracts with our component suppliers and our suppliers could suffer shortages longer lead times delay shipments prioritize shipments to other vendors decommit orders increase prices or cease manufacturing such products or selling them to us at any time supply of these components worldwide are being adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic as well as industry consolidation and geopolitical conditions such as international trade wars like the us trade war with china and increased political tensions in russia europe or asia such shortages increased component lead times reduced allocations of components and decommitments of orders have and could continue to result in increased component prices fewer sourcing options unpredictability of supply manufacturing disruptions and increased product lead times in the past we have also experienced shortages in inventory for dynamic random access memory integrated circuits semiconductors and delayed releases of the next generation of chipset which delayed our production andor the release of our new products in addition we have experienced an increase in cost of certain components 

although we have increased our purchase commitments to support longterm customer demand if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner or if we are unable to obtain alternative sources for these components shipments of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products any of these events could result in a cancellation of orders lost sales reduced gross margins or damage to our end customer relationships which would adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects additionally if our suppliers do not meet their commitments or actual demand does not directly match with our demand forecasts it could result in excess or obsolete inventory which we would be required to write down to its estimated realizable value which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

our reliance on component suppliers also yields the potential for the infringement or misappropriation of thirdparty intellectual property rights due to the incorporation of such components into our products we may not be indemnified by such component suppliers for such infringement or misappropriation claims any litigation for which we do 

not receive indemnification could require us to incur significant legal expenses in defending against such claims or require us to pay substantial royalty payments or settlement amounts that would not be reimbursed by our component suppliers 

our product development efforts are also dependent upon the success of our continued collaboration with our key merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap we select specific merchant silicon from these vendors for each new product it is critical that we work in tandem with these vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features that our products take advantage of such improved features and that such vendors are able to supply us with sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable term to meet customer demand reliance on these relationships allows us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies while leveraging their investments and expertise the merchant silicon vendors may not be successful in continuing to innovate meet deadlines for the release of their products or produce a sufficient supply of their products moreover these vendors may not collaborate with us or may become competitive with us by selling merchant silicon for “white boxes” or other products to our customers 

if our key merchant silicon vendors do not continue to innovate if there are delays in the release of their products or supply shortages if they no longer collaborate in such fashion or if such merchant silicon is not offered to us on commercially reasonable terms our products may become less competitive our own product launches could be delayed or we may be required to redesign our products to incorporate alternative merchant silicon which could result in lost sales reduce gross margins damage to our customer relationships or otherwise have a material effect on revenue and business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in the event of a shortage or supply interruption from our component suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner further longterm supply and maintenance obligations to end customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in addition our component suppliers change their selling prices frequently in response to market trends including industrywide increases in demand and because we do not have contracts with these suppliers or guaranteed pricing we are susceptible to availability or price fluctuations related to raw materials and components if we are unable to pass component price increases along to our end customers or maintain stable pricing our gross margins could be adversely affected and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology and network infrastructure spending may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology network connectivity and access to data and applications weak domestic or global economic conditions fear or anticipation of such conditions international trade disputes global pandemics or a reduction in information technology and network infrastructure spending even if economic conditions improve could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our distributors and reduced unit sales and lower or no growth for example the global macroeconomic environment could be negatively affected by among other things the covid19 pandemic or other epidemics instability in global economic markets increased us trade tariffs and trade disputes between the us china and other countries increased political tensions in europe and asia instability in the global credit markets the impact and uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy including the instability in the geopolitical environment as a result of the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union eu the threat of potential russian invasion of ukraine political tensions between taiwan and china political demonstrations and foreign governmental debt concerns such challenges have caused and are likely to continue to cause uncertainty and instability in local economies and in global financial markets 

in addition the covid19 pandemic has caused business disruptions around the world and may result in customers delaying or canceling capital expenditures on information technology and network infrastructure which may affect the overall demand for our products in light of the manufacturing disruptions and supply chain constraints caused by the covid19 pandemic end customers may also be placing orders in advance of demand to ensure supply continuing or worsening economic instability could result in a cancellation of such orders or otherwise adversely affect spending for it network infrastructure systems and tools a downturn may also significantly affect financing markets the availability of capital and the terms and conditions of financing arrangements including the overall cost of financing as well as the financial health or creditworthiness of our end customers circumstances may arise in which we need or desire to raise additional capital and such capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

we face intense competition especially from larger wellestablished companies and industry consolidation may lead to further increased competition which may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the markets in which we compete including the markets for data center campus networking and network security are intensely competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants this competition could result in increased pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and our failure to increase or the loss of market share any of which would likely seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the data center and campus networking markets have been historically dominated by cisco with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including extreme networks dellemc hewlett packard enterprise and juniper networks most of our competitors and some strategic alliance partners have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions and network security for example cisco acquired acacia communications broadcom acquired brocade communications systems extreme networks purchased certain data center networking assets from broadcombrocade and avaya dell acquired emc and hewlett packard enterprise acquired aruba networks this industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our business large system vendors are increasingly seeking to deliver toptobottom cloud networking solutions to end customers that combine cloudfocused hardware and software solutions to provide an alternative to our products we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete with us and this could lead to more variability in our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business the pricing of our solutions financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants including current technology partners suppliers and end customers or other cloud service providers who may acquire or develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products to market and sell to customers some of these competitors are developing networking products based on offtheshelf or commoditized hardware technology or “white box” hardware particularly where an end customer’s network strategy seeks to emphasize deployment of such product offerings or adopt a disaggregated approach to the procurement of hardware and software end customers may also increase their adoption of networking solutions based upon opensource network operating systems that may be provided for free and used either on “white box” or proprietary hardware the entrance of new competitors into our markets or the increased adoption of these new technology solutions or consumption models may cause downward pricing pressures result in lost sales or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our relationships with our strategic alliance partners or suppliers may also shift as industry dynamics changes if strategic alliance partners acquire or develop competitive products or services our relationship with those partners may be adversely impacted which could lead to more variability to our results of operations and impact the pricing of our solutions 

many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition and longer operating histories larger sales and marketing budgets and resources broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and end customers the ability to leverage their sales efforts across a broader portfolio of products the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services the ability to develop their own silicon chips the ability to set more aggressive pricing policies lower labor and development costs greater resources to make acquisitions larger intellectual property portfolio and substantially greater financial technical research and development or other resources 

in addition large competitors may have more extensive relationships with and within existing and potential end customers that provide them with an advantage in competing for business with those end customers for example certain large competitors encourage end customers of their other products and services to adopt their data networking solutions through discounted bundled product packages our ability to compete will depend upon our ability to provide a better solution than our competitors at a more competitive price we may be required to make substantial additional investments in research development marketing and sales in order to respond to competition and we cannot assure you that these investments will achieve any returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

we also expect increased competition if our market continues to expand as we continue to expand globally we have seen and continue to see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we have experienced and could continue to experience pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets as well as those with greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or other factors 

we are subject to a number of risks associated with the expansion of our international sales and operations 

our ability to grow our business and our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide many of our customers resellers partners suppliers and manufacturers operate around the world operating in a global marketplace we are subject to risks associated with having an international reach and compliance and regulatory requirements our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 

• ability to establish necessary business relationships and to comply with local business requirements including distributor and reseller relationships 

• greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods and nonstandard terms with customers related to payment warranties or performance obligations 

• increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining our international operations 

• fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies where we do business 

• general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets 

• risks associated with us and foreign legal requirements including those relating to anticorruption antibribery privacy data protection and the importation certification and localization of our products in foreign countries 

• risks associated with us government trade restrictions including those which may impose restrictions including prohibitions on the exportation reexportation sale shipment or other transfer of programming technology components andor services to foreign persons 

• risks of unexpected changes in regulatory practices tariffs and tax laws and treaties 

• greater risk of unexpected changes in tariffs imposed by the us and other countries 

• deterioration of political relations between the us and china russia canada mexico the united kingdom and the eu which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations as well as our supply chain in these countries 

• the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and 

• heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of or irregularities in financial statements 

these and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenue and consequently materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects expanding our existing international operations and entering into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial commitments our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit our future growth or materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we have invested and may continue to invest in or acquire other businesses which could require significant management attention disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we have made and could continue to make investments in complementary companies products or technologies which could involve licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in or acquisitions of other companies for example we completed the acquisition of awake security in october 2020 which required management to focus efforts on integrating awake security with the company we may not be able to find suitable investment or acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete such investments or acquisitions on favorable terms if at all if we do complete investments or acquisitions we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and any investments or acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end customers investors and securities analysts through acquisitions we continue to expand into new markets and new market segments and we may experience challenges in entering into new market segments for which we have not previously manufactured and sold products including facing exposure to new market risks difficulty achieving expected 

business results due to a lack of experience in new markets products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar distribution partners or vendors 

in addition investments and acquisitions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures for example if we are unsuccessful at integrating any acquisitions or retaining key talent from those acquisitions or the technologies associated with such acquisitions into our company the business financial condition results of operations and prospects of the combined company could be adversely affected we may have difficulty retaining the employees of any acquired business or the acquired technologies or research and development expectations may prove unsuccessful any integration process may require significant time and resources and we may not be able to manage the process successfully acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel or accurately forecast the financial effects of an acquisition transaction including accounting charges any acquisition or investment could expose us to unknown liabilities moreover we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities we may not be successful in retaining or expanding the customers and sales activities of any acquired business or in realizing the expected operational and cost efficiencies anticipated with the acquisition we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such investment or acquisition each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations moreover if the investment or acquisition becomes impaired we may be required to take an impairment charge which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock 

seasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations 

we operate on a december 31st year end and have typically experienced higher sequential product revenue growth in the fourth quarter followed by flat to declining sequential growth in the first quarter of the following year we believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors including the procurement budgeting and deployment cycles of many of our end customers our rapid historical growth may have reduced the impact of seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date if our increasing size causes our growth rate to slow seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition the current industrywide supply chain shortages and extended lead times and their impact on our ability to ship products to our customers in a timely manner may disrupt typical seasonal trends 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening us dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our end customers outside of the us which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase our product and operating costs in foreign locations further a portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the us is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates if we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with the currency fluctuations our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

if we needed to raise additional capital to expand our operations invest in new products or for other corporate purposes our failure to do so on favorable terms could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future if we did need to raise additional funds to expand our operations invest in new products or for other corporate purposes we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms if we raise additional equity financing our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our common stock could decline furthermore if we engage in debt financing the holders of such debt would have priority over the holders of common stock and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or impose other restrictions on our business we may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders including maintaining specified liquidity or other ratios any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms we may not be able to among other things enhance our products and services expand our sales and marketing and research and development organizations acquire complementary technologies products or 

businesses and respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

risks related to customers and sales 

if we are unable to attract new large end customers or to sell additional products and services to our existing end customers our revenue growth will be adversely affected and our revenue could decrease 

to increase our revenue we must add new end customers especially large end customers and sell additional products and services to existing end customers for example one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our solutions thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers we also believe the opportunity with current end customers is significant given their existing infrastructure and expected future spend another one of our sales strategies is focused on increasing penetration in the enterprise and campus markets however sales strategies focused on expansion to adjacent markets can require more time and effort since enterprise and campus end customers typically start with small purchases and there is often a long testing period for this reason in order to grow our revenue it is important for us to attract new large end customers some factors that may limit our ability to attract new large end customers include but are not limited to saturation with certain large cloud networking customers competition decreased capital spending by such customers a limited number of such customers and a decline in growth at such customers if we fail to attract new large end customers including enterprise and campus end customers or fail to reduce the sales cycle and sell additional products to our existing end customers our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

we expect large purchases by a limited number of end customers to continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue and any loss delay decline or other change in expected purchases could result in material quartertoquarter fluctuations of our revenue or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue we have experienced unpredictability in the timing of orders from these large end customers primarily due to changes in demand patterns specific to these customers the time it takes these end customers to evaluate test qualify and accept our products and the overall complexity of these large orders we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis for example sales to our end customers microsoft and meta platforms in fiscal 2019 collectively represented 40 of our total revenue whereas sales to our end customer microsoft in fiscal 2020 and 2021 amounted to 215 and 150 of our revenues respectively with our end customer meta platforms representing less than 10 of our revenues in both fiscal 2020 and 2021 we expect customer concentration with these large customers to be cyclical and linked to new product introductions and customer investment cycles in addition we typically provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur 

as a consequence of the concentrated nature of our customer base and their purchasing behavior our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate changes in the business requirements or focus upgrade cycles vendor selection project prioritization manner in which spending allocations are assigned among multiple vendors based upon specific network roles or projects financial prospects lack of growth of our customers capital resources and expenditures or purchasing behavior and deceleration in spending of our key end customers could significantly decrease our sales to such end customers or could lead to delays reductions or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services 

moreover because our sales are based primarily on purchase orders our customers may cancel delay reduce or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no notice to us for example due to the manufacturing disruptions and supply chain constraints caused by the covid19 pandemic end customers may be placing orders in advance of demand to ensure supply end customers may decide to delay or cancel such orders if economic conditions worsen this limited visibility regarding our end customers’ product needs the timing and quantity of which could vary significantly requires us to rely on estimated demand forecasts to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages which could lead to delays in fulfilling current and future purchase orders that can impede production by our customers and harm our customer relationships and in the event of a cancellation or reduction of an order we may not have enough time to reduce operating expenses to mitigate the effect of the lost revenue on our business and in addition could incur increased excess and obsolete inventory charges all of which could materially affect our operating results 

we may be unable to sustain or increase our revenue from our large end customers grow revenues with new or other existing end customers at the rate we anticipate or at all or offset the discontinuation of concentrated purchases by our larger end customers with purchases by new or existing end customers these customers could choose to divert all or a 

portion of their business with us to one of our competitors reassign spending allocations increase their adoption of white box solutions and open source network operating systems demand pricing concessions for our services require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs or reduce their spending levels if these factors drove some of our large customers to cancel all or a portion of their business relationships with us the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and longterm financial forecasts may be materially impacted we expect that such concentrated purchases will continue to contribute materially to our revenue for the foreseeable future and that our results of operations may fluctuate materially as a result of such larger end customers’ buying patterns in addition we may see consolidation of our customer base such as among internet companies and cloud service providers which could result in loss of end customers the loss of such end customers or a significant delay or reduction in their purchases including reductions or delays due to customer departures from recent buying patterns or an unfavorable change in competitive conditions could materially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are unable to increase market awareness of our company and our new products and services our revenue may not continue to grow or may decline 

we have not yet established broad market awareness of our new products and services including new products we introduced in the campus workspace and network security markets market awareness of our value proposition and products and services will be essential to our continued growth and our success particularly for the service provider and broader enterprise markets if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful in creating market awareness of our company and our products and services or in gaining access to new customer markets then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth 

some of our large end customers require more favorable terms and conditions from their vendors and may request price concessions as we seek to sell more products to these end customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenue 

our large end customers have significant purchasing power and as a result may receive more favorable terms and conditions than we typically provide to other end customers including lower prices bundled upgrades extended warranties acceptance terms indemnification terms and extended return policies and other contractual rights as we seek to sell more products to these large end customers an increased mix of our shipments may be subject to such terms and conditions which may reduce our margins or affect the timing of our revenue recognition and thus may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

sales of our switches generate most of our product revenue and if we are unable to continue to grow sales of these products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

historically we have derived substantially all of our product revenue from sales of our switches and we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future we have experienced declines in sales prices for our products including our 10 gigabit ethernet modular and fixed switches a decline in the price of switches and related services or our inability to increase sales of these products would harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects more seriously than if we derived significant revenue from a larger variety of product lines and services our future financial performance will also depend upon successfully developing and selling nextgeneration versions of our switches if we fail to deliver new products new features or new releases that end customers want and that allow us to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

the sales prices of our products and services may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our results of operations 

the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts a change in our mix of products and services the introduction of new products and services by us or by our competitors including the adoption of “white box” solutions promotional programs product and related warranty costs or broader macroeconomic factors in addition we have provided and may in the future provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers 

we have experienced declines in sales prices for our products and services competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and services additionally although we generally price our products and services worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may adversely affect actual prices that partners and end customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions 

furthermore sales prices and gross profits for our products may decrease over product life cycles decreased sales prices for any reason may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our result of operations 

our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense as a result our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly 

the timing of our sales and revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of our products’ sales cycles a sales cycle is the period between initial contact with a prospective end customer and any sale of our products endcustomer orders often involve the purchase of multiple products these orders are complex and difficult to complete because prospective end customers generally consider a number of factors over an extended period of time before committing to purchase the products and solutions we sell end customers especially our large end customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision and require considerable time to evaluate test and qualify our products prior to making a purchase decision and placing an order the length of time that end customers devote to their evaluation contract negotiation and budgeting processes varies significantly in addition customers may delay upgrades to their network infrastructure which extends the upgrade and sales cycle our products’ sales cycles can be lengthy in certain cases especially with respect to our prospective large end customers during the sales cycle we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities and make investments in evaluation equipment all of which lower our operating margins particularly if no sale occurs even if an end customer decides to purchase our products there are many factors affecting the timing of our recognition of revenue which makes our revenue difficult to forecast for example there may be unexpected delays in an end customer’s internal procurement processes particularly for some of our larger end customers for which our products represent a very small percentage of their total procurement activity in addition due to the covid19 pandemic the sales cycle may be extended and there may be delays and reductions of expenditures and cancellations by end customers there are many other factors specific to end customers that contribute to the timing of their purchases and the variability of our revenue recognition including the strategic importance of a particular project to an end customer budgetary constraints and changes in their personnel 

even after an end customer makes a purchase there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase in addition the significance and timing of our product enhancements and the introduction of new products by our competitors may also affect end customers’ purchases for all of these reasons it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed the particular period in which a sale will be completed or the period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized if our sales cycles lengthen our revenue could be lower than expected which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings and our failure to offer highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

once our products are deployed within our end customers’ networks our end customers depend on our support organization and our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products highquality support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products if we or our channel partners do not assist our end customers in deploying our products effectively do not succeed in helping our end customers resolve postdeployment issues quickly or do not provide adequate ongoing support or if we experience quality issues with these new products it could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing end customers and could harm our reputation with potential end customers in addition as we expand our operations internationally our support organization will face additional challenges including those associated with delivering support training and documentation in languages other than english our failure or the failure of our channel partners to maintain highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on end customers renewing their maintenance and support contracts any decline in maintenance renewals could harm our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we typically sell our products with maintenance and support as part of the initial purchase and a portion of our annual revenue comes from renewals of maintenance and support contracts our end customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance and support contracts after the expiration of the initial period and they may elect not to renew their maintenance and support contracts to renew their maintenance and support contracts at lower prices through alternative channel partners or to reduce the product quantity under their maintenance and support contracts thereby reducing our future revenue from maintenance and support contracts if our end customers especially our large end customers do not renew their maintenance and support contracts or if they renew them on terms that are less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

our standard sales contracts contain indemnification provisions requiring us to defend our end customers against thirdparty claims including against infringement of certain intellectual property rights that could expose us to losses which could seriously harm our business financial conditions results of operations and prospects 

under the indemnification provisions of our standard sales contracts we agree to defend our end customers and channel partners against thirdparty claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights which may include patents copyrights trademarks or trade secrets and to pay judgments entered on such claims an adverse ruling in such litigation may potentially expose us to claims in the event that claims are brought against our customers based on the ruling and we are required to indemnify such customers 

our exposure under these indemnification provisions is frequently limited to the total amount paid by our end customer under the agreement however certain agreements include indemnification provisions that could potentially expose us to losses in excess of the amount received under the agreement any of these events including claims for indemnification could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in addition to our own direct sales force we rely on distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers to sell our products and our failure to effectively develop manage or prevent disruptions to our distribution channels and the processes and procedures that support them could cause a reduction in the number of end customers of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon maintaining our relationships with distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers and establishing additional sales channel relationships we anticipate that sales of our products to a limited number of channel partners will continue to account for a material portion of our total product revenue for the foreseeable future we provide our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our products but these steps may not be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services if we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive programs for our channel partners we may not be able to incentivize these partners to sell our products to end customers these partners may have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our products altogether one of our channel partners could elect to consolidate or enter into a strategic partnership with one of our competitors which could reduce or eliminate our future opportunities with that channel partner our agreements with our channel partners may generally be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice we may be unable to retain these channel partners or secure additional or replacement channel partners the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners requires extensive training and any new or expanded relationship with a channel partner may take several months or more to achieve productivity 

where we rely on the channel partners for sales of our products we may have little or no contact with the ultimate users of our products that purchase through such channel partners thereby making it more difficult for us to establish brand awareness ensure proper delivery and installation of our products service ongoing endcustomer requirements estimate endcustomer demand and respond to evolving endcustomer needs in addition our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to end customers fail to comply with their contractual obligations or violate laws or our corporate policies if we fail to effectively manage our existing sales channels or if our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our products if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of highquality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

we anticipate increasing our sales efforts to us and foreign federal state and local governmental end customers in the future sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we have attained revised certifications government demand and payment for our products and services may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects selling to government entities may also require us to comply with various 

regulations that are not applicable to sales to nongovernment entities including regulations that may relate to pricing classified material prohibitions against use of certain foreign components in our products and services and other matters complying with such regulations may also require us to put in place controls and procedures to monitor compliance with the applicable regulations that may be costly or not possible we are not currently certified to perform work under classified contracts with government entities failure to comply with any such regulations could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government ceasing to buy our products and services a reduction of revenue fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the us government may require certain products that it purchases to be manufactured in the us and other relatively highcost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet these requirements any of these and other circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition the us government may require that products it purchases contain a certain threshold of “domestic origin” components in order to meet “buy america” requirements 

we are exposed to the credit risk of our channel partners and some of our end customers which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with standard payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the us we monitor individual endcustomer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the end customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts we are unable to recognize revenue from shipments until the collection of those amounts becomes reasonably assured any significant delay or default in the collection of significant accounts receivable could result in an increased need for us to obtain working capital from other sources possibly on worse terms than we could have negotiated if we had established such working capital resources prior to such delays or defaults any significant default could adversely affect our results of operations and delay our ability to recognize revenue 

a material portion of our sales is derived through our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers some of our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers may experience financial difficulties which could adversely affect our collection of accounts receivable distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other systems integrators valueadded resellers and end customers distributors represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be less likely to have the reserve resources required to meet payment obligations our exposure to credit risks of our channel partners may increase if our channel partners and their end customers are adversely affected by global or regional economic conditions one or more of these channel partners could delay payments or default on credit extended to them either of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

risks related to products and services 

product quality problems defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate advanced technologies including both hardware and software technologies despite testing prior to their release our products may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products could result in a failure of appropriate updates to be distributed or installed could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could result in warranty claims and product liability claims from customers any actual or perceived defect error or vulnerability in our products or services or other allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in analyzing correcting or redesigning the products or otherwise addressing defects errors or vulnerabilities cause us to lose significant end customers harm our reputation and market positions subject us to liability for damages subject us to litigation regulatory inquiries or investigations and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

from time to time we have had to replace certain components of products that we had shipped and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs including failures in software protocols or defective component batches resulting in reliability issues in such products and we may be required to do so in the future we may also be required to provide full replacements or refunds for such defective products we cannot assure you that such remediation or any of the other circumstances described above including claims litigation or regulatory investigations would not have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance or if we do not successfully manage product introductions we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

we must continue to enhance our existing products and develop new technologies and products that address emerging technological trends evolving industry standards and changing endcustomer needs the process of enhancing our existing products and developing new technology is complex and uncertain and new offerings require significant upfront investment that may not result in material design improvements to existing products or result in marketable new products or costs savings or revenue for an extended period of time if at all 

in addition new technologies could render our existing products obsolete or less attractive to end customers and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if such technologies are widely adopted for example end customers may prefer to address their network switch requirements by licensing software operating systems separately and placing them on “white box” hardware rather than purchasing integrated hardware products as has occurred in the server industry additionally end customers may require product upgrades including higher ethernet speeds and additional functionality to address the increasing demands of the cloud computing environments 

in the past several years we have announced a number of new products and enhancements to our products and services including new products in the campus workspace and network security markets the success of our new products depends on several factors including but not limited to appropriate new product definition the development of product features that sufficiently meet enduser requirements our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues component costs availability of components timely completion and introduction of these products prompt solution of any defects or bugs in these products our ability to support these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products for example our new product releases will require strong execution from our thirdparty merchant silicon chip suppliers to develop and release new merchant silicon chips that satisfy endcustomer requirements to meet expected release schedules and to provide sufficient quantities of these components if we are unable to successfully manage our product introductions or transitions or if we fail to penetrate new markets as a result of any of these or other factors our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

our product releases introduced new software products that include the capability for disaggregation of our software operating systems from our hardware the success of our strategy to expand our software business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the additional development efforts and costs to create these new products or make them compatible with other technologies the potential for our strategy to negatively impact revenues and gross margins and additional costs associated with regulatory compliance 

we may not be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology or endcustomer requirements on a timely basis or at all if we fail to keep up with technology changes or to convince our end customers and potential end customers of the value of our solutions even in light of new technologies we may lose customers decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and services and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products must interoperate with operating systems software applications and hardware that is developed by others and if we are unable to devote the necessary resources to ensure that our products interoperate with such software and hardware we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening demand for our products 

generally our products comprise only a part of the network infrastructure and must interoperate with our end customers’ existing infrastructure specifically their networks servers software and operating systems which may be manufactured by a wide variety of vendors and oems our products must comply with established industry standards in order to interoperate with the servers storage software and other networking equipment in the network infrastructure such that all systems function efficiently together we depend on the vendors of servers and systems in a data center to support prevailing industry standards often these vendors are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are also some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our end customers 

in addition when new or updated versions of these software operating systems or applications are introduced we must sometimes develop updated versions of our software so that our products will interoperate properly we may not accomplish these development efforts quickly costeffectively or at all these development efforts require capital investment and the devotion of engineering resources if we fail to maintain compatibility with these systems and 

applications our end customers may not be able to adequately utilize our products and we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening in demand for our products among other consequences which would adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

risks related to supply chain and manufacturing 

managing the supply of our products and product components is complex insufficient component supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing our extended supply chain is complex and our inventory management systems and related supplychain visibility tools may not enable us to forecast accurately and effectively manage the supply of our products and product components our ability to manage our supply chain may also be adversely affected by other factors including geopolitical conditions such as the impact of the covid19 pandemic and the us trade war with china and increased political tensions in russia europe and asia the covid19 pandemic and related global geopolitical and economic conditions have resulted in manufacturing and supply chain disruptions including temporary closures of certain contract manufacturer and supplier facilities which in turn have caused and may continue to cause shortages of and extended lead times for components used to manufacture our products a reduction unpredictability or interruption of supply prioritization of component shipments to other vendors and decommitments of orders insufficient component supply or any increases in the time required to manufacture our products may lead to inventory shortages and manufacturing disruptions that could result in increased customer lead times for our products delayed revenue cancellation of orders or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential end customers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available 

in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply we have issued and expect to continue to issue purchase orders for components and products that are noncancellable and nonreturnable including purchase commitments for semiconductors as disclosed in note 7 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k as a result of covid19 related supply disruptions we have extended our demand planning horizon and increased our purchase commitments for components and products in order to support longterm customer demand there is however no guarantee that suppliers will meet their commitments or that actual customer demand will directly match our demand forecasts we establish a liability for noncancellable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our component inventory suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or for products that are considered obsolete in addition we establish a liability and reimburse our contract manufacturer for component inventory purchased on our behalf that has been rendered excess or obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders or in cases where inventory levels greatly exceed our demand forecasts our noncancellable commitments and the cash deposits to secure our purchases to our contract manufacturers are disclosed in note 7 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory to its estimated realizable value which in turn could result in lower gross margins if we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

because we depend on thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping endcustomer orders on time if at all or on a costeffective basis which may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

we depend on thirdparty contract manufacturers to manufacture our product lines a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to these thirdparty contract manufacturers our reliance on these thirdparty contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process quality assurance product costs and product supply and timing which exposes us to risk our reliance on contract manufacturers also yields the potential for their infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of our products or their misappropriation of our intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of other customers’ products if we are unable to manage our relationships with our thirdparty contract manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers suffer delays or disruptions or quality control problems in their operations experience increased manufacturing lead times capacity constraints or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our end customers would be severely impaired and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be seriously harmed 

to the extent that our products are manufactured at facilities in foreign countries we may be subject to additional risks associated with complying with local rules and regulations in those jurisdictions including shelter in place orders issued in connection with the covid19 pandemic for example due to the covid19 pandemic some of our contract manufacturers have experienced temporary closures and labor shortages as a result of shelter in place orders issued in their 

local jurisdictions while our manufacturing sites are currently operational further shelter in place orders factory closures or reductions in staffing in these or other manufacturing sites would result in material disruptions increased lead times and supply shortages of our products 

our contract manufacturers typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual orders we do not have longterm contracts with our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular pricing terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements which could result in supply shortages and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice for example a competitor could place large orders with the thirdparty manufacturer thereby utilizing all or substantially all of such thirdparty manufacturer’s capacity and leaving the manufacturer little or no capacity to fulfill our individual orders without price increases or delays or at all our contract with one of our contract manufacturers permits it to terminate the agreement for convenience subject to prior notice requirements we may not be able to develop alternate or second contract manufacturers in a timely manner 

if we add or change contract manufacturers or change any manufacturing plant locations within a contract manufacturer network we would add additional complexity and risk to our supply chain management and may increase our working capital requirements ensuring a new contract manufacturer or new plant location is qualified to manufacture our products to our standards and industry requirements could take significant effort and be time consuming and expensive any addition or change in manufacturers may be extremely costly time consuming and we may not be able to do so successfully 

in addition we may be subject to additional significant challenges to ensure that quality processes and costs among other issues are consistent with our expectations and those of our customers a new contract manufacturer or manufacturing location may not be able to scale its production of our products at the volumes or quality we require this could also adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers which could damage our customer relationships and cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end customers late delivery penalties delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins this could also result in increased levels of inventory subjecting us to increased excess and obsolete charges that could have a negative impact on our operating results 

any production interruptions labor shortages or disruptions for any reason including those noted above as well as a natural disaster epidemic such as the covid19 pandemic capacity shortages adverse results from intellectual property litigation or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would adversely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we base our inventory requirements on our forecasts of future sales if these forecasts are materially inaccurate we may procure inventory that we may be unable to use in a timely manner or at all 

we and our contract manufacturers procure components and build our products based on our forecasts these forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products which are in turn based on historical trends and analysis from our sales and marketing organizations adjusted for overall market conditions and other factors more recently in order to address supply chain shortages and extended lead times we have extended our demand planning horizon and increased our purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers and suppliers and we have issued and may continue to issue purchase orders for components and products that are noncancellable and nonreturnable including purchase commitments for semiconductors as disclosed in note 7 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k however there is no guarantee that suppliers will meet their commitments or that actual customer demand will directly match our demand forecasts our noncancellable commitments and the cash deposits to secure our purchases to our contract manufacturers are disclosed in note 7 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k if our forecasts are materially inaccurate customers orders are cancelled or if we otherwise do not need such inventory we may under or overprocure inventory and such inaccuracies in our forecasts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to intellectual property and other proprietary rights 

assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights or other lawsuits asserted against us could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network infrastructure network security and wifi industries and have resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies many companies in the network 

infrastructure network security and wifi industries including our competitors and other third parties as well as nonpracticing entities own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us from time to time they have or may in the future also assert such claims against us our end customers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties for example we have previously been involved in litigation with cisco and optumsoft and are currently involved in litigation with wsou which is described in the “legal proceedings” subheading in note 7 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur or if we enter into new markets claims of infringement misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase any claim of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights by a thirdparty even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim distract our management from our business and require us to cease use of such intellectual property in addition some claims for patent infringement may relate to subcomponents that we purchase from third parties if these third parties are unable or unwilling to indemnify us for these claims we could be substantially harmed 

the patent portfolios of most of our competitors are larger than ours this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent crosslicenses in addition future assertions of patent rights by third parties and any resulting litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection we cannot assure you that we are not infringing or otherwise violating any thirdparty intellectual property rights 

the thirdparty asserters of intellectual property claims may be unreasonable in their demands or may simply refuse to settle which could lead to expensive settlement payments longer periods of litigation and related expenses additional burdens on employees or other resources distraction from our business supply stoppages and lost sales 

an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay substantial damages or penalties including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a thirdparty’s patents cease making licensing using or importing into the us products or services that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others expend additional development resources to attempt to redesign our products or services or otherwise to develop noninfringing technology which may not be successful enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or intellectual property rights and indemnify our partners and other third parties any damages penalties or royalty obligations we may become subject to as a result of an adverse outcome and any thirdparty indemnity we may need to provide could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects royalty or licensing agreements if required or desirable may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures further there is little or no information publicly available concerning market or fair values for license fees which can lead to overpayment of license or settlement fees in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us suppliers subject to thirdparty intellectual property claims also may choose or be forced to discontinue or alter their arrangements with us with little or no advance notice to us any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in the event that we are found to infringe any thirdparty intellectual property we could be enjoined or subject to other remedial orders that would prohibit us from making licensing using or importing into the us such products or services in order to resume such activities with respect to any affected products or services we or our component suppliers would be required to develop technical redesigns to this thirdparty intellectual property that no longer infringe the thirdparty intellectual property in any efforts to develop technical redesigns for these products or services we or our component suppliers may be unable to do so in a manner that does not continue to infringe the thirdparty intellectual property or that is acceptable to our customers these redesign efforts could be extremely costly and time consuming as well as disruptive to our other development activities and distracting to management moreover such redesigns could require us to obtain approvals from the court or administrative body to resume the activities with respect to these affected solutions we may not be successful in our efforts to obtain such approvals in a timely manner or at all any failure to effectively redesign our solutions or to obtain timely approval of those redesigns by a court or administrative body may cause a disruption to our product shipments and materially and adversely affect our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition for example in two prior investigations brought by cisco in the international trade commission “itc” we were subjected to remedial orders that prohibited us from importing and selling after importation any products the itc found to infringe cisco’s patents as a result we were required to redesign certain aspects of our 

products and obtain us customs and border protection’s approval of those redesigns before we could continue to import those products into the united states 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights 

we depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology we rely on trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection 

the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner we may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions further we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims to the extent that additional patents are issued from our patent applications which is not certain they may be contested circumvented or invalidated in the future moreover the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages and as with any technology competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future in addition we rely on confidentiality or license agreements with third parties in connection with their use of our products and technology there is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements or that we will be able to adequately enforce our rights in part because we rely on “shrinkwrap” licenses in some instances 

we have not registered our trademarks in all geographic markets failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our ability to enforce and defend our trademark rights and result in indemnification claims further any claim of infringement by a thirdparty even those claims without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claim could divert management attention from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property in certain geographic markets 

despite our efforts the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the united states 

detecting and protecting against the unauthorized use of our products technology and proprietary rights is expensive difficult and in some cases impossible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources either of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and there is no guarantee that we would be successful furthermore many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to protecting their technology or intellectual property rights than we do accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property which could result in a substantial loss of our market share 

we rely on the availability of licenses to thirdparty software and other intellectual property 

many of our products and services include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties and we otherwise use software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties in our business this exposes us to risks over which we may have little or no control for example a licensor may have difficulties keeping up with technological changes or may stop supporting the software or other intellectual property that it licenses to us also it will be necessary in the future to renew licenses expand the scope of existing licenses or seek new licenses relating to various aspects of these products and services or otherwise relating to our business which may result in increased license fees these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms if at all in addition a thirdparty may assert that we or our end customers are in breach of the terms of a license which could among other things give such thirdparty the right to terminate a license or seek damages from us or both the inability to obtain or maintain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain or maintain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in releases of products and services and could otherwise disrupt our business until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and services or otherwise in the conduct of our business moreover the inclusion in our products and services of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis may limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software that we use if we combine our software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release portions of the source code of our software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products moreover we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products will be effective if we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products on terms that are not economically feasible to reengineer our products to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available in source code form our proprietary code any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we provide access to our software and other selected source code to certain partners which creates additional risk that our competitors could develop products that are similar to or better than ours 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our internally developed technology which is incorporated in the source code for our products we seek to protect the source code design code documentation and other information relating to our software under trade secret patent and copyright laws however we have chosen to provide access to selected source code of our software to several of our partners for codevelopment as well as for open application programming interfaces apis formats and protocols though we generally control access to our source code and other intellectual property and enter into confidentiality or license agreements with such partners as well as with our employees and consultants this combination of procedural and contractual safeguards may be insufficient to protect our trade secrets and other rights to our technology our protective measures may be inadequate especially because we may not be able to prevent our partners employees or consultants from violating any agreements or licenses we may have in place or abusing their access granted to our source code improper disclosure or use of our source code could help competitors develop products similar to or better than ours 

risks related to litigation 

we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 

from time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent copyright commercial product liability employment class action whistleblower and other litigation in addition to governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources cause us to incur significant expenses or liability andor require us to change our business practices for example we were previously involved in litigation with cisco and optumsoft in addition on november 25 2020 wsou investments llc wsou filed a lawsuit against us in the western district of texas asserting that certain of our products infringe three wsou patents wsous allegations are directed to certain features of our wireless and switching products wsou seeks remedies including monetary damages attorney’s fees and costs on february 4 2021 we filed an answer denying wsous allegations on november 5 2021 the case was transferred to the northern district of california trial has been set for october 23 2023 we intend to vigorously defend against the claims brought against us by wsou however we cannot be certain that any of wsous claims will be resolved in our favor regardless of the merits of those claims any adverse litigation ruling could result in a significant damages award against us and injunctive relief 

because of the potential risks expenses and uncertainties of litigation we may from time to time settle disputes even where we have meritorious claims or defenses although we have insurance which may provide coverage for some kinds of claims we may face that insurance may not cover some kinds of claims or types of relief and may not be adequate in a particular case because litigation is inherently unpredictable we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

for more information regarding the litigation in which we have been involved see the “legal proceedings” subheading in note 7 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k incorporated herein by reference 

risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy 

defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products the failure of our products to detect security breaches or incidents the misuse of our products or the risks of product liability could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operating results 

our products services and internal network systems could become a target for security attacks including attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and our customers and introduce malicious software and attacks by state sponsors if our products services or internal networks system or data are or are perceived to have been compromised our reputation may be damaged and our financial results may be negatively affected 

organizations are increasingly subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks systems endpoints products and services and no security solution including our security platform can address all possible security threats or block all methods of penetrating a network products and services or otherwise perpetrating a security incident additionally any defects errors or vulnerabilities in our security platform or in the hardware upon which it is deployed including a failure to implement updates to such platform could temporarily or permanently limit our detection capabilities and expose our endcustomers’ networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats if customers of our security platform do suffer a data security incident or data breach even if it is not attributable to a failure of our platform to identify any threat or vulnerability customers may believe that our platform failed to detect a threat or vulnerability which could harm our reputation or negatively affect our financial results 

the classifications of application type virus spyware vulnerability exploits data or url categories by our security platform may also falsely detect report and act on applications content or threats that do not actually exist these false positives may impair the perceived reliability of our security platform and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our security platform any such false identification of important files or applications could result in damage to our reputation negative publicity loss of channel partners endcustomers and sales increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation 

breaches of our cybersecurity systems or other security breaches or incidents with respect to our products services networks systems or data could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services to our customers delay our ability to recognize revenue compromise the integrity of our software products and our networks systems and data result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property damage our reputation expose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data 

we increasingly depend upon our it systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners computer programmers or other persons or organizations may attempt to penetrate our network security or that of our website or systems and access use or obtain confidential personal or otherwise sensitive or proprietary information about us or our customers or via these or other methods including denial of service attacks and other cyberattacks disrupt or cause interruptions of our service these risks may increase due to the current covid19 pandemic because the techniques used to access disrupt or sabotage networks and systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition our software and sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain vulnerabilities or defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could cause the software or applications to fail or otherwise to unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system or that could result in a breach of or disruption to our systems products services or networks or the systems networks products or services of third parties that support us and our services we also face risks of others gaining unauthorized access to our products and services and introducing malicious software and such malicious software defects bugs or vulnerabilities or other defects bugs or vulnerabilities in our products or services may result in failures or interruptions of our products or services or expose our endcustomers networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats we have also outsourced a number of our business functions to third parties including our manufacturers logistics providers and cloud service providers and our business operations also depend in part on the success of these third parties’ own cybersecurity measures similarly we rely upon distributors resellers and system integrators to sell our products and our sales operations depend in part on the reliability of their cybersecurity measures additionally we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential sensitive and proprietary data and deploy our it resources with the use of security measures designed to prevent exposure of our networks and systems to security breaches and incidents and the loss of data we and all of the aforementioned third parties also face the risk of ransomware and other malicious software phishing schemes and other social engineering methods fraud and other malfeasance cybersecurity threats from state sponsors and other actors and intentional or negligent acts or omissions of employees and contractors furthermore our acquisition of 

awake security and our provision of its ndr platform may result in us being a more attractive target for such attacks accordingly if our cybersecurity systems and measures or those of any of the aforementioned third parties fail to protect against sophisticated cyberattacks other means of effectuating security breaches or incidents interruptions or other disruptions of our or our thirdparty service providers’ systems networks products or services the mishandling of data by employees and contractors or any other means of unauthorized access to or use of our manufacturing process products services networks systems or data that we or such third parties maintain operate or process our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways including 

• sensitive data regarding our business or our customers including intellectual property and other proprietary data could be stolen or lost modified rendered unavailable or otherwise used or processed 

• our electronic communications systems including email and other methods or other systems and access to or availability of data could be disrupted or harmed and our ability to conduct our business operations could be seriously damaged until such systems or data access and availability can be restored which we may be unable to achieve in a prompt manner or at all 

• our ability to process customer orders and electronically deliver products and services could be degraded and our distribution channels could be disrupted resulting in delays in revenue recognition 

• defects and security vulnerabilities could be introduced into our software thereby damaging the reputation and perceived reliability and security of our products and potentially making the data systems of our customers vulnerable to further data loss and cyber incidents 

• our manufacturing process products services supply chain network systems and data could be corrupted and 

• personal data of our customers employees contractors and business partners could be lost accessed obtained modified disclosed or used without authorization or otherwise compromised 

should any of the above events occur or be perceived to occur we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our customers and others and regulatory investigations and actions from governmental agencies and we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to remediate and otherwise address any data security incident or breach including to notify individuals entities or regulatory bodies and to implement measures in an effort to prevent further breaches or incidents in addition our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised and our reputation and competitive position could be significantly harmed also the regulatory and contractual actions proceedings litigation investigations fines penalties and liabilities relating to any actual or perceived data breaches or security incidents that result in losses of damage or destruction of or unauthorized access to or acquisition of credit card information or other personal or sensitive data of users of our services can be significant in terms of fines and reputational impact and necessitate changes to our business operations that may be disruptive to us additionally we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and other measures in an effort to prevent network and system disruptions and other security breaches and other incidents even the perception of inadequate security may damage our reputation and negatively impact our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers consequently our financial performance and results of operations could be adversely affected by any of the foregoing types of security breaches incidents vulnerabilities or other matters or the perception that any of them have occurred 

in addition we cannot assure that any limitation of liability provisions in our customer agreements contracts with thirdparty vendors and service providers or other contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other securityrelated matter we also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all or that any future claim will not be excluded or otherwise be denied coverage by any insurer the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business including our reputation financial condition and operating results 

risks related to accounting compliance regulation and tax 

if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

assessing our processes procedures and staffing in order to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes many of which are done manually and are dependent upon individual data input or review these processes include but are not limited to 

calculating revenue inventory costs and the preparation of our statement of cash flows while we continue to automate our processes and enhance our review controls to reduce the likelihood for errors we expect that for the foreseeable future many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect or if there is a change in accounting principles our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes a change in these principles or interpretations could harm our revenue and financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change in addition we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as described in management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities equity revenue and expenses significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation and contract manufacturersupplier liabilities income taxes and loss contingencies if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions our results of operations may be adversely affected and may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

enhanced united states tax tariff importexport restrictions chinese regulations or other trade barriers may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

there is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united states and various other countries most significantly china with respect to trade policies treaties tariffs and taxes in 2018 the office of the us trade representative the “ustr” enacted a tariff of 10 on imports into the us from china including communications equipment products and components manufactured and imported from china since then additional tariffs have been imposed by the ustr on imports into the united states from china and china has also imposed tariffs on imports into china from the united states although the united states and china signed an interim trade agreement in january 2020 the new administration has not yet negotiated a trade agreement 

in addition due to concerns with the security of products and services from certain telecommunications and video providers based in china us congress has enacted bans on the use of certain chineseorigin components or systems either in items sold to the us government or in the internal networks of government contractors and subcontractors even if those networks are not used for governmentrelated projects further the chinese government has responded to these us actions by indicating its intention to develop an unreliable entity list which may limit the ability of companies on the list to engage in business with chinese customers 

if tariffs trade restrictions or trade barriers remain in place or if new tariffs trade restrictions or trade barriers are placed on products such as ours by us or foreign governments especially china our costs may increase we believe we can adjust our supply chain and manufacturing practices to minimize the impact of the tariffs but our efforts may not be successful there can be no assurance that we will not experience a disruption in our business related to these or other changes in trade practices and the process of changing suppliers in order to mitigate any such tariff costs could be complicated timeconsuming and costly 

the us tariffs may also cause customers to delay orders as they evaluate where to take delivery of our products in connection with their efforts to mitigate their own tariff exposure such delays create forecasting difficulties for us and increase the risk that orders might be canceled or might never be placed current or future tariffs imposed by the us may also negatively impact our customers sales thereby causing an indirect negative impact on our own sales even in the absence of further tariffs the related uncertainty and the markets fear of an escalating trade war might cause our distributors and customers to place fewer orders for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity financial condition andor results of operations 

given the relatively fluid regulatory environment in china and the united states and uncertainty how the us government or foreign governments will act with respect to tariffs international trade agreements and policies a trade war further governmental action related to tariffs or international trade policies or additional tax or other regulatory changes in the future could directly and adversely impact our financial results and results of operations 

changes in our income taxes or our effective tax rate enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application of existing tax laws of various jurisdictions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors some of which are outside of our control including earnings that are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our ability to generate and use tax attributes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities transfer pricing adjustments from tax authorities challenging our methods for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements tax effects of nondeductible compensation including certain stockbased compensation tax costs related to intercompany restructuring changes in accounting principles imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries or customers or a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain foreign earnings 

significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions and determine our income tax liability the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect income taxes or additional paidin capital 

tax laws are dynamic and subject to change changes in tax laws and regulations and interpretations of such laws and regulations including taxation of earnings outside of the us may have adverse effects on our operating results and could impact the tax treatment of our earnings and cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies or rates in various jurisdictions including the united states may be subject to significant change for example the house of representatives passed the build back better act containing tax reform legislation that includes changes to provisions addressing global intangible lowtaxed income foreign derived intangible income and the base erosion antiabuse tax and the disallowance of tax deductions for certain expenses all of which could result in increased marginal corporate tax rates if the bill is passed in the senate beginning in 2022 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 “tcja” eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to amortize them over five years pursuant to irc section 174 although congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement to later years we have no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified if the requirement is not modified it will materially increase our cash taxes beginning in 2022 we do not however anticipate any material change to our effective tax rate as we selected the deferred method of accounting with respect to global intangible low tax income calculations in addition several countries including the united states and ireland as well as the organization for economic cooperation and development have reached agreement on a global minimum tax initiative many countries are also actively considering changes to existing tax laws or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate our business 

finally we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities audits by the irs or other tax authorities are subject to inherent uncertainties and could result in unfavorable outcomes including potential fines or penalties as we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions the expense of defending and resolving such an audit may be significant the amount of time to resolve an audit is also unpredictable and may divert management’s attention from our business operations we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our income taxes we cannot assure you that fluctuations in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application or interpretation of existing tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns by tax authorities will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business is subject to regulation by various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety environmental laws including new laws related to climate change consumer protection laws privacy data protection antibribery laws importexport controls conflict minerals federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the united states for example the eu has implemented the general data protection regulation “gdpr” the gdpr provides for substantial obligations relating to the handling storage and other processing of data relating to individuals and administrative fines for violations which can be up four percent of the previous year’s annual revenue or €20 million whichever is higher we have relied on the euus and swissus privacy shield programs and the use of standard contractual clauses approved by the european commission scc to legitimize these transfers both the euus privacy shield and the sccs have been subject to 

legal challenge we continue to analyze the july 2020 “schrems ii” decision by the court of justice of the eu cjeu and its impact on our data transfer mechanisms as well as subsequent guidance from data privacy regulators and new sccs published by the european commission in june 2021 the effects of the cjeus decision and related developments relating to crossborder data transfer are uncertain and difficult to predict among other effects we may experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens and new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing data on our behalf we may experience reluctance or refusal by current or prospective european customers to use our products and we may find it necessary or desirable to make further changes to our handling of personal data of residents of the european economic area “eea” the regulatory environment applicable to the handling of eea residents’ personal data and our actions taken in response may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs and could result in our business operating results and financial condition being harmed additionally we and our customers may face a risk of enforcement actions by data protection authorities in the eea relating to personal data transfers to us and by us from the eea any such enforcement actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources distract management and technical personnel and negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition further the uk has implemented legislation that substantially provides for the gdpr which provides for fines of up to the greater of 175 million british pounds or four percent of the previous year’s annual revenue whichever is higher the relationship between the uk and the eu in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear following the uk’s exit from the eu including with respect to regulation of data transfers between eu member states and the uk 

several jurisdictions have passed new laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and other matters and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” became operative on january 1 2020 the ccpa requires covered companies to among other things provide new disclosures to california consumers and affords such consumers new abilities to optout of certain sales of personal information certain aspects of the ccpa and its interpretation remain uncertain and are likely to remain uncertain for an extended period further a new privacy law the california privacy rights act “cpra” was approved in the november 3 2020 election the cpra modifies the ccpa significantly creating obligations relating to consumer data beginning on january 1 2022 with implementing regulations expected on or before july 1 2022 and enforcement beginning july 1 2023 passage of the cpra has resulted in further uncertainty and may require us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply in addition to the ccpa numerous other states’ legislatures are considering similar laws that will require ongoing compliance efforts and investment for example in march 2021 virginia enacted a consumer data protection act that will go into effect on january 1 2023 and in june 2021 colorado enacted a colorado privacy act that will go into effect on july 1 2023 both of which share similarities with the ccpa cpra and legislation proposed in other states 

in addition some countries are considering or have enacted legislation requiring local storage and processing of data that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services accordingly we cannot predict the full impact of the ccpa the cpra or other evolving privacy and data protection obligations on our business or operations complying with emerging and changing legal and regulatory requirements relating to privacy data protection and other matters may cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes including the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection recycling and disposal of electrical and electronic equipment our failure or the failure of our partners including our contract manufacturers to comply with past present and future environmental laws could result in fines penalties thirdparty claims reduced sales of our products reengineering our products substantial product inventory writeoffs and reputational damage any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we also expect that our business will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis applicable to us and our partners including our contract manufacturers to date our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows although we cannot predict the future effect of such laws or regulations they will likely result in additional costs or require us to change the content or manufacturing of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

from time to time we may receive inquiries from governmental agencies or we may make voluntary disclosures regarding our compliance with applicable governmental regulations or requirements relating to various matters including importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations which could lead to formal investigations actual or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or other governmental requirements could lead to regulatory investigations enforcement actions and other proceedings private claims and litigation and potentially may subject us to sanctions mandatory product recalls enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages civil and criminal penalties or injunctions if any governmental fines penalties or other sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

could be materially adversely affected in addition responding to any investigation action or other proceeding will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees enforcement actions investigations and fines penalties and other sanctions could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls 

our products may be subject to various export controls and because we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products certain of our products may be exported from various countries only with the required export license or through an export license exception if we were to fail to comply with the applicable export control laws customs regulations economic sanctions or other applicable laws we could be subject to monetary damages or the imposition of restrictions which could be material to our business operating results and prospects and could also harm our reputation further there could be criminal penalties for knowing or willful violations including incarceration for culpable employees and managers obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities furthermore certain export control and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products technology software and services to embargoed countries and sanctioned governments entities and persons even though we take precautions to ensure that we and our channel partners comply with all relevant regulations any failure by us or our channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences including reputational harm government investigations and penalties 

although we have developed procedures and controls to comply with export control and other applicable laws historically we have had some instances where we inadvertently have not fully complied with certain export control laws but we have disclosed them to and implemented corrective actions with the appropriate government agencies 

in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including through import permit and license requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our end customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential end customers with international operations or create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the value of your investment could decline 

the trading price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include but are not limited to forwardlooking statements related to future revenue gross margins and earnings per share changes or decreases in our growth rate manufacturing supply or distribution shortages or constraints ratings changes by securities analysts actual or anticipated announcements of new products by our company or our competitors litigation actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations regulatory developments repurchases of our common stock departures of key executives major catastrophic events and broad market and industry fluctuations 

in addition technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility and if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company if the market price of our common stock is volatile we may become the target of securities litigation securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business and prospects this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we have adopted stock repurchase programs to repurchase shares of our common stock however any future decisions to reduce or discontinue repurchasing our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase programs could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

although our board of directors has authorized stock repurchase programs any determination to execute our stock repurchase programs will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital requirements and other factors as well as our board of director’s continuing determination that the repurchase programs are in the best interests of our shareholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase programs our stock repurchase programs do not obligate us to acquire any common stock if we fail to meet any expectations related to stock repurchases the market price of our common stock could decline and could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence additionally price volatility of our common stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our common stock to exceed the stock’s market price at a given point in time 

we may further increase or decrease the amount of repurchases of our common stock in the future any reduction or discontinuance by us of repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our current stock repurchase programs could cause the market price of our common stock to decline moreover in the event repurchases of our common stock are reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume repurchasing common stock at historical levels could result in a lower market valuation of our common stock 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that such sales might occur could reduce the market price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us based on shares outstanding as of december 31 2021 holders of approximately 211 of our common stock have rights subject to some conditions to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders in addition we have registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans if holders by exercising their registration rights sell large numbers of shares it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

insiders have substantial control over us which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions including a change of control 

our directors executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 10 of our outstanding common stock together with their affiliates in the aggregate beneficially own approximately 196 of the outstanding shares of our common stock based on shares outstanding as of december 31 2021 as a result these stockholders if acting together could exercise a significant level of influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests this concentration of ownership may also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock or otherwise may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change of control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock 

our charter documents and delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

• a classified board of directors with threeyear staggered terms which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares including preferences and voting rights without stockholder approval which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer 

• the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation death or removal of a director which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors 

• a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders 

• the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors our president our secretary or a majority vote of our board of directors which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action including the removal of directors 

• the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 23 of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock voting together as a single class to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt 

• the ability of our board of directors by majority vote to amend the bylaws which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt and 

• advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition as a delaware corporation we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law these provisions may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time 

general risks 

if we are unable to hire retain train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel particularly software engineering and sales personnel in addition our success in expanding into adjacent markets including the enterprise market requires a significant investment of time effort and financial resources into hiring and training our sales force to address these markets if we do not effectively train our direct sales force we may be unable to add new end customers increase sales to our existing end customers or successfully expand into new markets competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense especially in the san francisco bay area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have to provide more attractive compensation packages and other amenities research and development personnel are aggressively recruited by startup and growth companies which are especially active in many of the technical areas and geographic regions in which we conduct product development in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the hightechnology industry job candidates often consider the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to attract motivate or retain key employees in addition our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations our employment arrangements with our employees do not generally require that they continue to work for us for any specified period and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time if we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel or if there are delays in hiring required personnel our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be seriously harmed 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods health epidemics and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

our corporate headquarters and the operations of our key manufacturing vendors logistics providers and partners as well as many of our customers are located in areas exposed to risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis including the san francisco bay area japan and taiwan a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake tsunami fire or a flood or other catastrophic event such as the covid19 pandemic or other disease outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our or their business which could in turn materially affect our financial condition results of operations and prospects these events could result in manufacturing and supply chain disruptions shipment delays order 

cancellations and sales delays which could result in missed financial targets any health epidemic could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain components for our products that are supplied from asia or to manufacture our products in asia any such disruption of our suppliers our contract manufacturers or our service providers would likely impact our sales and operating results in addition a health epidemic could adversely affect the economies of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and likely impact our operating results in addition acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or end customers or the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or end customers that affects sales at the end of our quarter could have a particularly significant adverse effect on our quarterly results 

we have not paid dividends in the past and do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared nor paid any dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases

overview 

arista networks pioneered datadriven cognitive cloud networking for largescale data center and campus workspace environments our cloud networking solutions consist of our extensible operating system eos a set of network applications and our ethernet switching and routing platforms we are a leader in cloud networking solutions delivering high performance scalability availability programmability workload orchestration automation and visibility in recent years we have sought to bring the operational consistency and principles of cloud networking to the broader enterprise and campus markets with our cognitive cloud networking extending eos across the enterprise data center and campus wired and wireless workspaces 

we generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching and routing platforms which incorporate our eos software and related network applications we also generate revenue from postcontract support pcs which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products and renewals of pcs we sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners as of december 31 2021 we had delivered our cloud networking solutions to over 8000 end customers worldwide our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others 

historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue we have experienced unpredictability in the timing of orders from these large end customers primarily due to changes in demand patterns specific to these customers the time it takes these end customers to evaluate test qualify and accept our products and the overall complexity of these large orders we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis for example sales to our end customers microsoft and meta platforms in fiscal 2019 collectively represented 40 of our total revenue whereas sales to our end customer microsoft in fiscal 2020 and 2021 amounted to 215 and 150 of our revenues respectively with our end customer meta platforms representing less than 10 of our revenues in both fiscal 2020 and 2021 while we experienced some decline in overall revenue in 2020 the decline in revenue from these large end customers in 2021 was more than offset by stronger sales to our enterprise and other cloud and service provider customers in addition we typically provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur we expect customer concentration with these large end customers to be cyclical and linked to new product introductions and customer investment cycles 

we believe that cloud computing represents a fundamental shift from traditional legacy network architectures as organizations of all sizes have moved workloads to the cloud spending on cloud and nextgeneration data centers has increased rapidly while traditional legacy it spending has grown more slowly our cloud networking platforms are well positioned to address the growing cloud networking market and to address increasing performance requirements driven by the growing number of connected devices as well as the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications 

the markets for cloud networking solutions are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology changing endcustomer needs evolving industry standards frequent introductions of new products and services and industry consolidation we expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for cloud networking expands and existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products our future success is dependent upon our ability to continue to evolve and adapt to our rapidly changing environment we must also continue to develop marketleading products and features that address the needs of our existing and new customers and increase sales in the enterprise data center switching and campus workspace markets we intend to continue expanding our sales force and marketing activities in key geographies as well as our relationships with channel technology and systemlevel partners in order to reach new end customers more effectively increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support in addition we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our ability to rapidly develop new features and applications 

our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our eos software and enhancements to eos we engineer our products to be agnostic with respect to the underlying merchant silicon architecture the programmability of eos has allowed us to expand our software applications to address the everincreasing demands of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility analytics and network detection and response and has further allowed us to integrate rapidly with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services this enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions we work closely with thirdparty contract manufacturers to manufacture our products our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our thirdparty direct fulfillment facilities we and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling final configuration quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers 

covid19 update 

the global coronavirus “covid19” pandemic continues to disrupt and have unpredictable impacts to our global society economies financial markets and business activities we are actively monitoring and evaluating developments as the situation evolves and will continue to take further actions in our approach to address covid19 we have prioritized the protection of our employees during this pandemic and as a result our offices across the globe have remained closed limiting access to facilitiesbased employees and a limited number of employees on a voluntary basis and continue to impose some travel restrictions in addition our manufacturing and supply chain operations have experienced significant constraints with component shortages increased supply chain costs and delays broadly impacting the industry as a whole we continue to work closely with our contract manufacturers and supply chain partners who have experienced delays in component sourcing workforce disruptions and governmental restrictions on the production and export of their products although we have worked diligently to drive improvements in these areas including funding additional working capital and incremental purchase commitments these delays have negatively impacted our ability to supply products to our customers on a timely basis we have increased our purchase commitments and expect to continue to invest in working capital to address delays in component sourcing and the risk of future covid19 related supply chain disruptions but we cannot be certain that such delays or disruptions will not occur 

the extent of the impact of covid19 on our operational and financial performance including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame will depend on future developments including the duration of the pandemic the breadth and duration of governmental containment measures such as workplace travel and social distancing restrictions as well as the reauthorization of or increase in such measures in the event of spikes in covid19 infection rates the success of the covid19 vaccination deployment and the impact on our customers partners employees contract manufacturers and supply chain all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted however any continued or renewed disruption in manufacturing and supply resulting from the covid19 pandemic or related containment measures could negatively impact our business we also believe that any extended or renewed covid19 related economic disruption could have a negative impact on demand from our customers in future periods accordingly current results and financial condition discussed herein may not be indicative of future operating results and trends 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2021 compared to year ended december 31 2020 

revenue cost of revenue and gross margin in thousands except percentages 



revenue by geography in thousands except percentages 



revenue 

product revenue primarily consists of sales of our switching and routing products and software licenses service revenue is primarily derived from sales of pcs contracts which is typically purchased in conjunction with our products and subsequent renewals of those contracts we expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on among other things the timing size and complexity of orders especially with respect to our large end customers 

product revenue increased by 5469 million or 299 in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 which reflected stronger demand for our products from new and existing customers and broader market acceptance of our enterprise and campus products service revenue increased by 836 million or 172 in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal pcs contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand international revenues increased from 235 in 2020 to 268 in 2021 which was mostly driven by increased shipments to our large end customers in the emea region 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

cost of product revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our thirdparty contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors overhead costs of our manufacturing operations and other costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory cost of service revenue primarily consists of personnel and other costs associated with our global customer support and services organizations 

cost of revenue increased by 2316 million or 277 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 these increases were primarily driven by a corresponding increase in product and service revenues coupled with an increase in supply chain costs due to increased production capacity and higher volumes 

gross margin or gross profit as a percentage of revenue has been and will continue to be affected by a 

variety of factors including pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition the mix of sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing manufacturingrelated costs including costs associated with supply chain sourcing activities merchant silicon costs the mix of products sold and excessobsolete inventory writedowns including charges for excessobsolete component inventory held by our contract manufacturers we expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above 

gross margin slightly decreased from 639 for the year ended december 31 2020 to 638 for the year ended december 31 2021 the change in gross margin was unfavorably impacted by higher supply chain costs as well as increased service costs to support our growing installed base these unfavorable impacts were mostly offset by improved product margins due to a reduced proportion of our sales to larger end customers who generally receive larger discounts 

operating expenses in thousands except percentages 

our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs personnel costs consist of wages benefits bonuses and with respect to sales and marketing expenses sales commissions personnel costs also include stockbased compensation and travel expenses 



research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs prototype expenses thirdparty engineering costs and an allocated portion of facility and it costs our research and development efforts are focused on new product development and maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products including new releases and upgrades to our eos software and applications we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and continue to invest in our technology 

research and development expenses increased by 1002 million or 206 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 the increase was primarily due to a 670 million increase in personnel costs driven by an increase in headcount and a 323 million increase in new product introduction costs including thirdparty engineering and other product development costs 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs marketing trade shows and other promotional activities and an allocated portion of facility and it costs we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide 

sales and marketing expenses increased by 568 million or 248 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 the increase was primarily driven by increased headcount and higher sales volume resulting in increased compensation costs including salaries sales incentive compensation and stockbased compensation 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and professional services costs general and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive finance human resources and legal functions our professional services costs are primarily related to external legal accounting and tax services 

general and administrative expenses increased by 169 million or 255 for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 the increase was driven by a 177 million increase in personnel costs primarily stockbased compensation which was partially offset by a decrease in nonrecurring acquisitionrelated expenses of 42 million resulting from the acquisitions of big switch and awake security in 2020 

other income net in thousands except percentages 

other income net consists primarily of interest income from our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities gains and losses on our investments in privatelyheld companies and marketable securities and foreign currency transaction gains and losses we expect other income net may fluctuate in the future as a result of the remeasurement of our private company equity investments upon the occurrence of either observable price changes or impairments changes in interest rates or returns on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 



the unfavorable change in other income net during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2020 was driven by a 199 million decrease in interest income which was primarily caused by significant declines in the yields of government and corporate bonds in our investment portfolio in addition we recorded a gain on sale of marketable securities and a gain on investments in privatelyheld companies in 2020 which did not recur in 2021 

provision for income taxes in thousands except percentages 

we operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to local country income tax and may also be subject to us income tax generally our us tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these foreign earnings which avoids double taxation our tax expense to date consists of federal state and foreign current and deferred income taxes 



despite an increase in pretax income in 2021 as compared to 2020 our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 the decrease in our income taxes and effective tax 

rate was largely attributable to increased tax benefits from stockbased compensation combined with a favorable change in jurisdictional mix of earnings these two factors are variable in nature and past results may not be indicative of future results for further information regarding income taxes and the impact on our results of operations and financial position refer to note 10 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

revenue by geography in thousands except percentages 



revenue 

product revenue decreased by 1903 million or 94 in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease was primarily due to the recognition of 1251 million of deferred product revenue in the year ended december 31 2019 related to customer acceptance of products shipped in prior periods in addition we experienced reduced sales to our larger customers during fiscal 2020 combined with the impact of some covid19 related supply constraints service revenue increased by 971 million or 249 in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand international revenues remained relatively constant at 235 of total revenues in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 239 in 2019 with a slight decrease in growth in the emea region mostly offset by an increase in growth in our asiapacific region international revenue generally fluctuates based on the timing of deployments by certain of our large end customers 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

cost of revenue decreased by 307 million or 35 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to a corresponding decrease in product revenues 

and was partially offset by incremental covid19 related supply chain costs and increased product transition costs 

gross margin slightly decreased from 641 for the year ended december 31 2019 to 639 in 2020 gross margin was negatively impacted by incremental covid19 related supply chain costs and some increased product transition costs combined with the impact of fixed overhead costs on a lower revenue base these negative impacts were partially offset by a reduction in sales to our larger end customers who generally receive larger discounts and improved service margins as we scale our services organization 

operating expenses in thousands except percentages 



research and development 

research and development expenses increased by 238 million or 52 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 the increase was primarily due to a 268 million increase in stockbased compensation from new and refresh grants during fiscal 2020 and a 78 million increase in acquisitionrelated expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets from our acquisition of big switch and awake security partially offset by an 114 million decrease in new product introduction costs including thirdparty engineering and other product development costs 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses increased by 155 million or 72 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 the increase was driven by increased headcount resulting in increased compensation costs including salaries and stockbased compensation partially offset by a decrease in travel and other sales and marketing activities due to covid19 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses increased by 43 million or 70 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 the increase was primarily driven by acquisitionrelated costs from our acquisitions of big switch and awake security in fiscal year 2020 

other income net in thousands except percentages 



the unfavorable change in other income net during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 was driven by a 240 million decrease in interest income largely due to lower interest rates this was partially offset by a realized gain of 94 million on the sale of marketable securities in the third quarter of the year ended december 31 2020 

provision for income taxes in thousands except percentages 



for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we recorded an expense of 1043 million and 24 million for income taxes respectively and our effective tax rate increased from 03 in 2019 to 141 in 2020 the change in our income taxes was largely attributable to a net tax benefit of 86 million in 2019 resulting from an intraentity transaction to sell our nonamericas economic and beneficial intellectual property rights further while we experienced a decrease in worldwide profit before tax in 2020 compared to 2019 the tax benefits attributable to stockbased compensation also decreased along with an increase in foreign earnings taxed in nonzero rate jurisdictions resulting in overall higher tax expense for further information regarding income taxes and the impact on our results of operations and financial position refer to note 10 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations as of december 31 2021 our total balance of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 34 billion of which approximately 5760 million was held outside the us in our foreign subsidiaries 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general business purposes including the funding of working capital our marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highlyrated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss we plan to continue to invest for longterm growth we believe that our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing 

capabilities the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings our costs associated with supply chain activities including access to outsourced manufacturing our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies the continued market acceptance of our products and stock repurchases if we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected

material cash requirements 

our material cash requirements will have an impact on our future liquidity our material cash requirements represent material expected or contractually committed future payment obligations we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations 

leases 

we have operating lease arrangements for office space data center equipment and other corporate assets as of december 31 2021 we had lease payment obligations net of immaterial sublease income of 870 million with 235 million payable within 12 months 

purchase obligations 

purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations made either directly by arista or by our contract manufacturers on our behalf in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of december 31 2021 we had 25 billion of such purchase obligations with 23 billion payable within 12 months these open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding and while we may have some limited ability to reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services this can only occur with the agreement of the related supplier 

in addition to the purchase obligations outlined above we also entered into an agreement covering an additional 275 million of extended leadtime component purchase commitments in support of 2023 forecasted demand for which purchase orders had not been issued as of december 31 2021 

long term accrued income taxes 

in connection with the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 we recorded a federal income tax payable for transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings that will be payable over an eightyear period as of december 31 2021 63 million of longterm transition tax payable represents the remaining federal income tax payable due between one and three years in addition to the longterm transition tax payable as of december 31 2021 we have recorded longterm tax liabilities of 636 million related to uncertain tax positions however we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement if any of these future payments 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2021 we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

critical accounting estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap or us gaap and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods note 1 “organization and summary of significant accounting policies” of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company’s consolidated financial statements we base our estimates assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements which in turn could change the results from those reported we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from sales of our products which incorporate our eos software and accessories such as cables and optics to direct customers and channel partners together with pcs we typically sell products and pcs in a single contract we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or 

services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services most of our contracts with customers other than renewals of pcs contain multiple performance obligations with a combination of products and pcs products and pcs generally qualify as distinct performance obligations our hardware includes eos software which together deliver the essential functionality of our products for contracts which contain multiple performance obligations we allocate revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on the standalone selling price “ssp” judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp for products and pcs sold together in a contract to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and pcs 

if we do not have an observable ssp such as when we do not sell a product or service separately then ssp is estimated using judgment and considering all reasonably available information such as market conditions and information about the size andor purchase volume of the customer we generally use a range of amounts to estimate ssp for individual products and services based on multiple factors including but not limited to the sales channel reseller distributor or end customer the geographies in which our products and services are sold and the size of the end customer 

we limit the amount of revenue recognition for contracts containing forms of variable consideration such as future performance obligations customerspecific returns and acceptance or refund obligations we include some or all of an estimate of the related atrisk consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recorded under each contract will not occur when the uncertainties surrounding the variable consideration are resolved 

we may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is generally no contractual provision for such returns we estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical return rates applied against currentperiod shipments specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate 

we have elected a practical expedient to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts or performance obligations with similar characteristics so long as such application would not differ materially from applying the guidance to the individual contracts or performance obligations within that portfolio consequently we have chosen to apply the portfolio approach when possible which we do not believe will happen frequently additionally we will evaluate a portfolio of data when possible in various situations including accounting for commissions rights of return and transactions with variable consideration 

inventory valuation and contract manufacturersupplier liabilities 

inventories primarily consist of finished goods and strategic components primarily integrated circuits inventories are stated at the lower of cost computed using the firstin firstout method and net realizable value manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory we record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value 

our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts we record a liability and a corresponding charge for noncancellable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers or suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes 

we use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures these estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers product development plans and current sales levels in addition current industrywide supply chain shortages have resulted in extended lead times for components and have required us to extend the time horizon of our demand forecasts there is however no guarantee that all suppliers will meet their commitments in the time frame committed or that actual customer demand will directly match our demand forecasts if actual market demand conditions or supplier execution on commitments are less favorable than those projected by management which may be caused by factors within andor outside of our control we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers which could have 

an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturer and supplier liabilities 

income taxes 

significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for or benefit from income taxes including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets in assessing the need for a valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating results and estimates of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain foreign and state tax jurisdictions future reversals of taxable temporary differences and potential tax planning strategies an adjustment to the valuation allowance will either increase or decrease our provision for or benefit from income taxes in the period such determination is made 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions which involves significant judgment in the interpretation of complex domestic and international tax laws and may give rise to uncertain tax positions we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not that additional taxes interest and penalties will be due although management believes our unrecognized tax benefits are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our unrecognized tax benefits our unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax examination or the refinement of an estimate resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and investments in privatelyheld companies the ongoing covid19 pandemic has increased the volatility of global financial markets which may increase our foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk for further discussion of the potential impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business operating results and financial condition see risk factors included in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars and therefore our revenue is not directly subject to foreign currency risk however we are indirectly exposed to foreign currency risk a stronger us dollar could make our products and services more expensive in foreign countries and therefore reduce demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect such economic exposure to currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are also influenced by many other factors 

our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located which is primarily in the us and to a lesser extent in europe and asia our results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates on our monetary assets and liabilities would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations to date foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date and do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

interest rate sensitivity 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had cash cash equivalents and availableforsale marketable securities totaling 34 billion and 29 billion respectively cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in money market funds corporate bonds us agency mortgagebacked securities us treasury securities and commercial paper our primary investment objectives are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements in addition our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issuer we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the us a decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income on our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 the effect of an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have been material to our operating results and the total value of the portfolio assuming consistent investment levels 

on the other hand the fair market value of our investments in fixed income securities may be adversely impacted we would incur unrealized losses on fixed income securities if there is an increase in interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase in the unlikely event we are forced to sell our marketable securities prior to maturity we may incur realized losses in such investments however because of the conservative and shortterm nature of the investments in our portfolio a change in interest rates is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

investments in privatelyheld companies 

our nonmarketable equity investments in privatelyheld companies are recorded in “investments” in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the total carrying amount of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 202 million and 83 million during fiscal 2021 we did not record any adjustments to our investments during fiscal 2020 we recorded a net gain of 41 million on certain investments compared to a net gain of 54 million during fiscal 2019 see note 5 investments of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for details 

the privatelyheld companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privatelyheld companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return

in the early part of 2020 we acquired big switch networks a pioneer in network monitoring software these big switch capabilities integrated with the arista switching portfolio power the danz monitoring fabric dmf a leading network monitoring solution we also completed the acquisition of awake security an aidriven network detection and response ndr security company at the end of 2020 we believe the combination of dmf and awake security capabilities delivers the next generation of operationally efficient network security and visibility 

in addition we continued to expand our data center and campus network product portfolio during 2020 including the introduction of the 750 series modular chassis a modular campus poe switch that delivers high performance security visibility and power network security and visibility 

since we began shipping our products we have grown rapidly and according to market research we have achieved the second largest market share in data center ethernet switch ports and revenue excluding china we have been profitable and cash flow positive for each year since 2010 

we sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others our customers include six of the largest cloud services providers based on annual revenue  

our market opportunity 

we compete primarily in the data center switching market for 10 gigabit ethernet and above excluding blade switches we added advanced routing capabilities to our rseries switches which in addition to switching address the data center interconnect dci market and parts of the wide area networking routing market we more recently began to compete in the enterprise campus market for 1 gigabit ethernet switching and above and in the cloudmanaged wireless networking market in addition our acquisitions of big switch networks and awake security enhance our ability to address a portion of the network monitoring and network detection and response ndr security markets 

we believe that cloud computing represents a fundamental shift from traditional legacy network architectures as organizations of all sizes have moved workloads to the cloud spending on cloud and nextgeneration data centers has increased rapidly while traditional legacy it spending has grown more slowly 

our customers 

as of december 31 2020 we had delivered our cloud networking solutions to over 7000 end customers worldwide our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies 

and others for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 purchases by microsoft accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue 

cloud networking and digital transformation market drivers 

digital transformation is fundamentally changing the way it infrastructure is built and how applications are delivered from a cloud environment in cloud computing applications are distributed across thousands of servers these servers are connected with highspeed network switches that together form a pool of resources that allows applications to be rapidly deployed and costeffectively updated cloud computing enables ubiquitous and ondemand network access to these applications from internetconnected devices including personal computers tablets iot internet of things devices and smartphones 

nearly all consumer applications today are delivered as cloud services enterprise applications are rapidly moving to the cloud as well since cloud services are easier and more cost effective to deploy scale and operate than traditional applications internet leaders like amazon facebook google and microsoft pioneered the development of largescale cloud data centers in order to meet the growing demands of their users including business customers enterprises and service providers around the world are adopting cloud computing technologies in order to achieve similar performance improvements and cost reductions 

the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can be orders of magnitude higher than typical legacy data center networks therefore the networks in such cloud environments must be architected and built in a new way we refer to these nextgeneration data center networks as cloud networks cloud networks must deliver high capacity high availability and predictable performance and must be programmable to allow integration with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services 

examples of key secular trends driving network transformation are illustrated below 

limitations of traditional enterprise data center and campus networks 

we believe that cloud networks and legacy networks are fundamentally different in a traditional data center specific applications are installed on a small number of servers and most network traffic is servertoclient or “northsouth” traffic which results in perhaps a few terabitssecond of aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud most network traffic is servertoserver or “eastwest” traffic the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can exceed 1 petabitsecond orders of magnitude higher than that of typical legacy data center networks 

the much larger scale of cloud networks requires much higher network availability since network outages in the cloud are costly to customers traditional network switches have evolved and the features and capabilities of their operating system have expanded over many years without addressing the structural deficiencies of their underlying software architectures making it difficult to achieve high network switch reliability 

some networking vendors have built products that use proprietary protocols to address the scaling needs of nextgeneration data centers however proprietary protocols are generally disfavored by internet companies or cloud service providers because they create vendor lockin 

legacy enterprise networks are generally not programmable and as a result are extremely difficult to integrate with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services this lack of integration forces customers to continue to rely on time consuming errorprone manual processes that may be costprohibitive 

traditional enterprise wired and wireless campus networks must cope with an everincreasing number of endpoint iot internet of things devices for users to be connected anywhere campus administrators have sought to address the resulting increased network complexities and bottlenecks through the adoption of a myriad of platforms operating systems proprietary features and network management tools coupled with the explosive growth of iot and the requirement for workloads the operational costs of managing these complexities have become prohibitive 

our cloud networking solutions 

our cloud networking solutions consist of eos a set of networking applications and our gigabit ethernet platforms at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was architected to be fully programmable modular and reliable the programmability of eos has allowed us to expand our software applications to address the ever increasing demands of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility analytics and network detection and response and has further allowed us to integrate rapidly with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services 

an overview of our cloud networking solutions is shown below 

the key benefits of our cloud networking solutions are as follows 

capacity performance and scalability 

our cloud networking platform enables data center networks to scale to hundreds of thousands of physical servers and millions of virtual machines with the least number of switching tiers we achieve this by leveraging standard protocols to meet the scale requirements of cloud computing we have used activeactive layer 2 and layer 3 network topologies to enable customers to build extremely large and resilient networks 

high availability 

our highly modular eos software architecture was designed to be faultisolating and selfhealing in order to deliver higher availability compared to legacy network operating systems in addition our customers can nondisruptively upgrade our switches running in the network using our smart system upgrade or ssu application without interrupting the network service 

open and programmable 

our eos software was purposebuilt to offer programmable interfaces throughout all levels of our software this has allowed us to integrate our cloud networking platform with a wide range of leading thirdparty applications for example we support vmware nsx openconfigyang and microsoft system center for orchestration and fast provisioning enabling true workload mobility and automatic provisioning of physical switches we enable customers through application programming interfaces apis to write their own scripts to customize and optimize their networks 

workflow automation 

our eos software enables enterprises to provision networking resources in minutes with no manual intervention through our zero touch provisioning we also natively support ansible cfengine chef puppet virtual network orchestration applications and thirdparty management tools cloudvision a networkwide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation delivers a turnkey solution to enterprises looking to modernize their data centers for cloud networking cloudvision extends the same eos architectural approach across the network for state topology monitoring and visibility this enables enterprises to move to cloudclass automation without needing significant internal development finally eos embraces the devops model which is a software development method that combines development and operations to provision and monitor servers storage and network resources in a unified fashion 

network visibility 

our eos software provides a set of tools and applications that proactively monitor detect and notify network managers when network issues arise delivering realtime data to thirdparty network performance and security applications to provide detailed application visibility our network visibility applications provide realtime insight into the status of the network 

through the integration of danz features native to arista switches with big switch’s monitoring software we provide the danz monitoring fabric dmf dmf delivers network traffic analysis data analytics and contextual insights to enterprises looking for network wide observability 

security 

macrosegmentation services mss tm  is one of the services enabled via cloudvision since cloudvision maintains a networkwide database of all states within the network as well as direct integration with hypervisor resources like vmware vsphere and nsx macrosegmentation extends the concept of finegrained interhypervisor security to cloud networks by enabling dynamic security and services for physical to virtual workloads and is a complement to finegrained security delivered via microsegmentation that is already implemented in the virtual switch of the physical host on which a vm is running 

lower total cost of ownership 

our cloud networking platform offers architectural and system advantages that provide our customers with costeffective and highly available cloud networking solutions we believe our programmable scalable leafspine architectures combined with industryleading applications significantly reduce networking costs when compared to legacy network designs enabling faster time to service and improved availability our automation tools reduce the operational costs of provisioning managing and monitoring a data center network and speed up service delivery our visibility tools provide high levels of visibility into complex network environments without the need for additional data collection equipment as a result this lowers operational costs because fewer network engineers are needed to operate large networks 

cognitive cloud networking for the campus workspace 

our cognitive cloud networking solutions for the nextgeneration campus are based on three principles 

universal cloud network  we offer our universal cloud network as an alternative to brittle proprietary solutions from legacy vendors our universal cloud network is an open standardsbased design focusing on softwaredriven control principles our collapsed spline™ approach consolidates traditional campus core and aggregation layers into a simple single tier with high availability 

cognitive management plane  there is a void in management plane consistency and a need for datadriven analytics in the campus as in the data center we believe that a common model can be applied across both footprints saving customers operational costs the cognitive management plane cmp is a datadriven repository for the automated actions across network analytics 

securing the campus  securing the campus spline requires a holistic approach to network segmentation device compliance and auditing as well as service integration with our security partners we deliver these capabilities through eos dmf awake security and cloudvision

we offer multiple service options that allow our customers to select the product replacement service level that best meets their needs we stock spare parts in over 183 locations around the world through our thirdparty logistics suppliers all of our service options include unlimited access to bugfixes newfeaturereleases online case management and our community forums 

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our products through our direct sales force and in partnership with our channel partners including distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators and oem partners we also sell in conjunction with various technology partners to facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity we have created a partner program the arista partner program to engage partners who provide valueadded services and extend our reach into the marketplace authorized training partners perform technical training of our channel partners and end customers our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us 

our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for presales technical support and solutions engineering for our end customers systems integrators original equipment manufacturers or oems and channel partners a pool of shared channel sales and marketing representatives also supports these teams each sales team is responsible for a geographical territory has responsibility for a number of major direct endcustomer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market 

our marketing activities consist primarily of technology conferences web marketing trade shows product demonstrations seminars and events public relations analyst relations demand generation and direct marketing to build our brand increase endcustomer awareness communicate our product advantages and generate qualified leads for our field sales force and channel partners 

seasonality 

our rapid historical growth may have reduced the impact of seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date as our increasing size causes our growth rate to slow seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we operate on a december 31st year end and have typically experienced higher sequential product revenue growth in the fourth quarter followed by flattodeclining sequential growth in the first quarter of the following year we believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors including the procurement budgeting and deployment cycles of many of our end customers 

research and development 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and features that address the needs of our end customers our inhouse engineering personnel are responsible for the development quality documentation support and release of our products we plan to continue to invest in resources to conduct our research and development efforts 

manufacturing 

we subcontract the manufacturing of all of our products to various contract manufacturers our primary manufacturing partners are jabil circuit and sanmina corporation this approach allows us to reduce our costs manufacturing overhead and inventory position and allows us to adjust more quickly to changing endcustomer demand we require all of our manufacturing locations to be iso9001 certified we have four direct fulfillment facilities worldwide to hold finished goods inventory perform product transformations and install our eos software to ship to customers and partners 

our contract manufacturing partners procure the majority of the components needed to build our products and assemble our products according to our design specifications this allows us to leverage the purchasing power of our contract manufacturing partners we retain complete control over the bills of material test procedures and quality assurance programs our personnel work closely with our partners and review on an ongoing basis forecasts inventory levels processes capacity yields and overall quality our contract manufacturing partners procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts these forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analyses from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions 

our products rely on key components including merchant silicon integrated circuit components and power supplies purchased from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers we also expect to see increased consolidation among our component suppliers generally neither we nor our contract manufacturers have a written agreement with these component providers to guarantee the supply of the key components used in our products nor do we have exclusive rights to such key components and our suppliers could suffer shortages delay shipments prioritize shipments to other vendors increase prices or cease manufacturing such products or selling them to us at any time the supply of components may also be adversely affected by geopolitical conditions such as international trade wars like the us trade war with china and the impact of public health epidemics like the coronavirus currently spreading around the world 

our product development efforts also depend upon continued collaboration with our key suppliers including our merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors it is critical that we work in tandem with our key merchant silicon vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features this enables us to focus our research and development resources on software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions 

once the completed products are manufactured and tested our contract manufacturing partners ship them to various direct fulfillment facilities in the united states the netherlands and singapore for final configuration qualitycontrol inspection and shipment to our distribution partners and end customers after the products are shipped to our end customers our products are installed by the end customers or by thirdparty service providers such as system integrators or valueadded resellers on their behalf 

competition 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and characterized by rapidlychanging technology changing endcustomer needs evolving industry standards frequent introductions of new products and services and industry consolidation we expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for cloud networking expands and existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products 

the data center and campus networking markets have been historically dominated by cisco with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including extreme networks dellemc hewlett packard enterprise and juniper networks most of our competitors and some strategic alliance partners have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example broadcom acquired brocade communications systems extreme networks purchased certain data center networking assets from broadcombrocade and avaya as well as aerohive networks dell acquired emc hewlett packard enterprise acquired aruba networks and juniper networks acquired mist systems 

we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants current technology partners and end customers who may acquire or develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products to market and sell to customers some of these competitors are developing networking products based on offtheshelf or commoditized hardware technology or “white box” hardware particularly where an end customer’s network strategy seeks to emphasize deployment of such product offerings or adopt a disaggregated approach to the procurement of hardware and software end customers may also increase their adoption of networking solutions based upon open source network operating systems that may be provided for free and used either on “white box” or proprietary hardware the entrance of new competitors into our markets or the increased adoption of these new technology solutions or consumption models may cause downward pricing pressures result in lost sales or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

in the network detection and response ndr market awake security competes with other network security vendors including cisco darktrace and extrahop lastly in the network packet broker npb 

market arista danz monitoring fabric competes with gigamon ixia and other network monitoring software providers 

our relationships with our strategic alliance partners or suppliers may also shift as industry dynamics change if strategic alliance partners acquire or develop competitive products or services our relationship with those partners may be adversely impacted which could lead to more variability to our results of operations and impact the pricing of our solutions 

the principal competitive factors applicable to our products include 

• breadth of product offerings and features 

• reliability and product quality 

• ease of use 

• pricing 

• total cost of ownership including automation monitoring and integration costs 

• performance and scale 

• programmability and extensibility 

• interoperability with other products 

• ability to be bundled with other vendor offerings and 

• quality of service support and fulfillment 

we believe our products compete favorably with respect to these factors our eos software offers high reliability integrates with existing network protocols and is open and programmable we believe the combination of eos a set of network applications and our 125510254050100400 gigabit ethernet platforms make our offering highly competitive for both cloud and enterprise data centers however many of our competitors have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger sales and marketing budgets and resources broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and end customers greater access to larger endcustomer bases greater endcustomer support resources greater manufacturing resources the ability to leverage their sales efforts across a broader portfolio of products the ability to leverage purchasing power when purchasing subcomponents the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services the ability to develop their own silicon chips the ability to set more aggressive pricing policies lower labor and development costs greater resources to make acquisitions larger intellectual property portfolios and substantially greater financial technical research and development or other resources 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our core technology and intellectual property we rely on patent trademark and copyright laws trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees end customers resellers systems integrators and others to protect our intellectual property rights we file us and foreign patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products patents generally have a duration of twenty years from filing the remaining duration on the individual patents in our patent portfolio varies 

we cannot assure that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of valuable breadth or applicability in addition any patents that may be issued may be contested circumvented found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them we also license software from third parties for integration into our products including open source software and other software available on commerciallyreasonable terms we own a number of trademarks in the us and other jurisdictions including arista eos cloudvision 

cloudstream cvp cvx health tracer mapreduce tracer path tracer mxp mss rail score spline superspine ssu flexroute netrollback netdb osfp algomatch macrosegmentation and macrosegmentation service 

we control access to and use of our software technology and other proprietary information through internal and external controls including contractual protections with employees contractors end customers and partners our software is protected by us and international copyright patent and trade secret laws despite our efforts to protect our software technology and other proprietary information unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software technology and other proprietary information in addition we intend to expand our international operations and effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights if we become more successful we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights it may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights in particular large and established companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation from time to time third parties including certain of these large companies and nonpracticing entities may assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our end customers whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against such claims 

successful claims of infringement by a third party if any could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services require us to expend time and money to develop noninfringing solutions or force us to pay substantial damages royalties or other fees we cannot assure that we do not currently infringe or that we will not in the future infringe upon any thirdparty patents or other proprietary rights

risks related to our business and industry 

the covid19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the covid19 pandemic has had and could continue to have an adverse impact on the business operations of our company and our customers partners manufacturers suppliers distribution fulfillment centers and service depots to comply with the shelter in place orders and to safeguard our employees we closed all of our offices with limited exceptions for essential employees in certain locations and the vast majority of our employees continue to work from home in addition we experienced and may continue to experience manufacturing and supply chain disruptions and logistic challenges our contract manufacturers in malaysia mexico and the united states are impacted by the pandemic and have experienced shelter in place orders workforce disruptions and delays in production and exporting products while our contract manufacturers have made significant progress they may be subject to supply constraints similar to our manufacturing facilities our direct fulfillment centers and service depots continue to operate with varying degrees of government restriction on access which can materially impact our ability to ship products or provide support services to our customers as a result of covid19 related manufacturing disruptions the lead times for our products have increased and our supply chain costs have increased which has adversely impacted our gross margins in addition we have and may continue to purchase buffer inventories of components and products that have extended lead times to ensure adequate supply to support longterm customer demand and this may increase the risk of future excess and obsolete inventory and could have a negative impact on our gross margins 

as the covid19 pandemic continues we have experienced and may continue to experience additional risks including 

• more manufacturing disruptions and supply shortages 

• longer leadtimes for component parts incorporated into our products 

• reduced capacity and output at factories and factory closures 

• disruptions in logistics which impact the movement of components and finished products 

• overall increased demand for materials which could result in a limited supply of materials and components that are incorporated in our products 

• delays in product shipments and limits on our ability to provide inperson support services to customers 

• increased risk of future excess and obsolete inventory as we increase our inventory buffers of long lead time components to support longer term customer demand and 

• further increased lead times for our products 

the covid19 pandemic could limit our ability to add new customers and cause sales disruptions order cancellations longer upgrade cycles by customers for network equipment and overall lower demand for our products and services customers may purchase products in advance of their internal demand which could result in lower purchases in subsequent quarters we could face increased risk of customer defaults and delays in payment 

in addition the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the global economy and financial markets which may result in an extended economic slowdown or a global recession that could adversely impact our business due to the duration of the pandemic the uncertainty around vaccination deployment with respect to the covid19 pandemic the uncertainty around the impact of new strains of covid19 and uncertain timing of a global recovery we are unable to predict the full impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business operations and financial performance 

the networking market is rapidly evolving if this market does not evolve as we anticipate or our target end customers do not adopt our networking solutions we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the growth and evolution of the networking market the market demand for networking solutions has increased in recent years as end customers have deployed larger more sophisticated networks and have increased the use of virtualization and cloud computing the continued growth of this market will be dependent upon many factors including but not limited to the adoption of and demand for our end customers’ products and services the expansion evolution and build out of our end customers’ networks the capacity utilization of existing network infrastructures changes in the technological requirements for the products and services to be deployed in these networks the amount and mix of capital spending by our end customers the development of network switches and cloud service solutions by our large end customers for internal use the financial performance and prospects of our end customers the availability of capital resources to our end customers changes in government regulation that could impact networking business models including those regulations related to cybersecurity privacy data protection and net neutrality our ability to provide networking solutions that address the needs of end customers more effectively and economically than those of other competitors or existing technologies and general economic conditions including the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

if the networking solutions market does not develop in the way we anticipate or otherwise experiences a slowdown if our solutions do not offer benefits compared to competing networking products or if end customers do not recognize the benefits that our solutions provide then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

we pursue new product and service offerings and expand into adjacent markets and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted 

we have made substantial investments to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts to expand our product offerings and maintain our revenue growth if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products and services in a timely and costeffective manner if we fail to introduce products and services that meet market demand or if we do not successfully expand into adjacent markets we may lose our competitive position our products may become obsolete and our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected for example as we introduce our 400 gbe and 800 gbe products our ability to continue to maintain our competitive position with our customers will depend on their acceptance of these products 

additionally from time to time we invest in expansion into adjacent markets including campus switching wifi networking and network security markets although we believe these solutions are complementary to our current offerings we have less experience and a more limited operating history in these markets and our efforts in this area may not be successful expanding our services in existing and new markets and increasing the depth and breadth of our presence imposes significant burdens on our marketing compliance and other administrative and managerial resources our plan to expand and deepen our market share in our existing markets and possibly expand into additional markets is subject to a variety of risks and challenges our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors including but not limited to our ability to develop new products new product features and services that address the customer requirements for these markets attract a customer base in markets in which we have less experience compete with new and existing competitors in these adjacent markets and gain market acceptance of our new products 

developing our products is expensive and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle we expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform and introduce new products and features we expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these investments these investments may take several years to generate positive returns if ever 

additionally future market share gains may take longer than planned and cause us to incur significant costs if we are unable to attract new large end customers or to sell additional products and services to our existing end customers our revenue growth will be adversely affected and our revenue could decrease difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our revenue and our revenue growth rate may decline 

our revenue growth rate in previous periods may not be indicative of our future performance we have experienced annual revenue growth rates of 39 121 and 307 in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively in the future our revenue growth rates may be volatile as we become more penetrated in our existing customer base and product markets and as we look to enter and expand into new markets in addition covid19 related disruptions may have a negative impact on demand from our customers in future periods and on our ability to add new customers other factors may also contribute to declines in our growth rates including changes in demand for our products and services particularly from our large end customers changes in capital spending by our large end customers increased competition our ability to successfully manage our expansion or continue to capitalize on growth opportunities the maturation of our business general economic and international trade conditions and our ability to be successful in adjacent markets such as campus switching wifi networking markets and network security markets for example we have experienced volatility in demand from certain of our large end customers overall demand from larger customers may decline in future periods which would impact our future revenue growth you should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected and our stock price could be volatile 

our results of operations may vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors or our previously issued financial guidance or if any forwardlooking financial guidance does not meet the expectation of analysts or investors the market price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our results of operations have historically varied from period to period and we expect that this trend will continue as a result you should not rely upon our past financial results for any period as indicators of future performance our results of operations in any given period can be influenced by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict including 

• the disruption caused by covid19 and the government restrictions in response to the pandemic 

• our inability to fulfill our end customers’ orders due to the availability of inventory supply chain delays access to key commodities or technologies or events that impact our manufacturers or their suppliers 

• our ability to increase sales to existing customers and attract new end customers including large end customers 

• the budgeting sales and implementation cycles purchasing practices and buying patterns of end customers including large end customers who may receive lower pricing terms due to volume discounts and who may or may not make large bulk purchases in certain quarters or who may elect to reassign allocations to multiple vendors based upon specific network roles or projects 

• changes in the growth rate of existing or new customers including large end customers and service providers changes in endcustomer distributor or reseller requirements or market needs and changes in growth rates of the networking market 

• the cost and potential outcomes of existing and future litigation 

• increased expenses resulting from the tariffs imposed by the us on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on us goods including the tariffs implemented by the us government on various imports from china 

• changes in our pricing policies whether initiated by us or as a result of competition 

• the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operation and expansion of our business 

• difficulty forecasting budgeting and planning due to limited visibility beyond the first two quarters into the spending plans of current or prospective customers 

• deferral reduction or cancellation of orders from end customers including in anticipation of new products or product enhancements announced by us or our competitors or warranty returns 

• the inclusion of any acceptance provisions in our customer contracts or any delays in acceptance of those products 

• the actual or rumored timing and success of new product and service introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive landscape of our industry including consolidation among our competitors or end customers 

• our ability to successfully expand our business domestically and internationally 

• our ability to increase the size and production of our sales or distribution channel or any disruption in or termination of our sales or distribution channels 

• decisions by potential end customers to purchase our networking solutions from larger more established vendors white box vendors or their primary network equipment vendors 

• insolvency or credit difficulties confronting our end customers which could adversely affect their ability to purchase or pay for our products and services or confronting our key suppliers including our sole source suppliers which could disrupt our supply chain 

• seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets 

• future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies 

• our overall effective tax rate including impacts caused by any reorganization in our corporate structure any changes in our valuation allowance for domestic deferred tax assets and any new legislation or regulatory developments including the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “tax act” 

• increases or decreases in our expenses caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as an increasing portion of our expenses are incurred and paid in currencies other than the us dollar 

• general economic conditions both domestically and in foreign markets and disruptions in our business and the markets due to among other things health epidemics natural disasters terrorism and other catastrophic events 

• increases in cybersecurity threats including security threats from state sponsors and 

• other risk factors described in this annual report on form 10k 

any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of several of the factors described above may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other results of operations and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in the past we have failed to meet investor financial expectations and the market price of our common stock declined this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our revenue gross margins results of operations or other expectations contained in any forward looking financial guidance we have issued or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for a particular period if we fail to meet or exceed such guidance or expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our common stock could decline substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and to be adversely affected by numerous factors 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and the gross margins we have achieved in recent years may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including but not limited to 

changes in endcustomer geographic or product mix increased price competition introduction of new products and new business models including the sale and delivery of more software and subscription solutions increases in material or component costs and production costs entry into new markets or growth in lower margin markets entry in markets with different pricing and cost structures pricing discounts given to customers costs associated with defending intellectual property infringement and other claims and the potential outcomes of such disputes excess inventory and inventory holding charges changes in shipment volume the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals increased costs arising from tariffs increased costs arising from epidemics changes in distribution channels increased warranty costs and our ability to execute our operating plans we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quarter to quarter failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

interruptions or delays in shipments could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

we may be subject to supply chain delays or endcustomer buying patterns in which a substantial portion of sales orders and shipments may occur in the second half of each quarter this places significant pressure on order review and processing supply chain management manufacturing inventory and quality control management shipping and trade compliance to ensure that we have properly forecasted supply purchasing manufacturing capacity inventory and quality compliance and logistics a significant interruption in these critical functions it could result in delayed order fulfillment adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology and network infrastructure spending may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology network connectivity and access to data and applications weak domestic or global economic conditions fear or anticipation of such conditions international trade disputes global pandemics or a reduction in information technology and network infrastructure spending even if economic conditions improve could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our distributors and reduced unit sales and lower or no growth for example the global macroeconomic environment could be negatively affected by among other things the covid19 pandemic or other epidemics instability in global economic markets resulting from fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impact of the covid19 pandemic increased us trade tariffs and trade disputes between the us china and other countries instability in the global credit markets the impact and uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy including the instability in the geopolitical environment as a result of the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union eu political demonstrations and foreign governmental debt concerns such challenges have caused and are likely to continue to cause uncertainty and instability in local economies and in global financial markets in addition the covid19 pandemic has caused business disruptions around the world and may result in customers delaying or canceling capital expenditures on information technology and network infrastructure which may affect the overall demand for our products continuing or worsening economic instability could adversely affect spending for it network infrastructure systems and tools a longer period of economic uncertainty or a downturn may also significantly affect financing markets the availability of capital and the terms and conditions of financing arrangements including the overall cost of financing as well as the financial health or creditworthiness of our end customers circumstances may arise in which we need or desire to raise additional capital and such capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

we face intense competition especially from larger wellestablished companies and industry consolidation may lead to further increased competition which may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the markets in which we compete including the markets for data center campus networking and network security are intensely competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants this competition could result in increased pricing pressure reduced profit margins 

increased sales and marketing expenses and our failure to increase or the loss of market share any of which would likely seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the data center and campus networking markets have been historically dominated by cisco with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including extreme networks dellemc hewlett packard enterprise and juniper networks most of our competitors and some strategic alliance partners have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions and network security for example broadcom acquired brocade communications systems extreme networks purchased certain data center networking assets from broadcombrocade and avaya dell acquired emc and hewlett packard enterprise acquired aruba networks this industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our business large system vendors are increasingly seeking to deliver toptobottom cloud networking solutions to end customers that combine cloudfocused hardware and software solutions to provide an alternative to our products we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete with us and this could lead to more variability in our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business the pricing of our solutions financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants including current technology partners suppliers and end customers or other cloud service providers who may acquire or develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products to market and sell to customers some of these competitors are developing networking products based on offtheshelf or commoditized hardware technology or “white box” hardware particularly where an end customer’s network strategy seeks to emphasize deployment of such product offerings or adopt a disaggregated approach to the procurement of hardware and software end customers may also increase their adoption of networking solutions based upon open source network operating systems that may be provided for free and used either on “white box” or proprietary hardware the entrance of new competitors into our markets or the increased adoption of these new technology solutions or consumption models may cause downward pricing pressures result in lost sales or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our relationships with our strategic alliance partners or suppliers may also shift as industry dynamics changes if strategic alliance partners acquire or develop competitive products or services our relationship with those partners may be adversely impacted which could lead to more variability to our results of operations and impact the pricing of our solutions 

many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition and longer operating histories larger sales and marketing budgets and resources broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and end customers the ability to leverage their sales efforts across a broader portfolio of products the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services the ability to develop their own silicon chips the ability to set more aggressive pricing policies lower labor and development costs greater resources to make acquisitions larger intellectual property portfolio and substantially greater financial technical research and development or other resources 

in addition large competitors may have more extensive relationships with and within existing and potential end customers that provide them with an advantage in competing for business with those end customers for example certain large competitors encourage end customers of their other products and services to adopt their data networking solutions through discounted bundled product packages our ability to compete will depend upon our ability to provide a better solution than our competitors at a more competitive price we may be required to make substantial additional investments in research development marketing and sales in order to respond to competition and we cannot assure you that these investments will achieve any returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

we also expect increased competition if our market continues to expand as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we may experience pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies 

with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets as well as those with greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or other factors 

we are subject to a number of risks associated with the expansion of our international sales and operations 

our ability to grow our business and our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide many of our customers resellers partners suppliers and manufacturers operate around the world operating in a global marketplace we are subject to risks associated with having an international reach and compliance and regulatory requirements our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 

• ability to establish necessary business relationships and to comply with local business requirements including distributor and reseller relationships 

• greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods and nonstandard terms with customers related to payment warranties or performance obligations 

• increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining our international operations 

• fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies where we do business 

• general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets 

• risks associated with us and foreign legal requirements including those relating to anticorruption antibribery privacy data protection and the importation certification and localization of our products in foreign countries 

• risks associated with us government trade restrictions including those which may impose restrictions including prohibitions on the exportation reexportation sale shipment or other transfer of programming technology components andor services to foreign persons 

• greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices tariffs and tax laws and treaties including the tax act particularly since there has been a change in us presidential administration 

• greater risk of unexpected changes in tariffs imposed by the us and other countries 

• deterioration of political relations between the us and china russia canada mexico the united kingdom and the eu which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations in these countries 

• the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and 

• heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of or irregularities in financial statements 

these and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenue and consequently materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects expanding our existing international operations and entering into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial commitments our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit our future growth or materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we may invest in or acquire other businesses which could require significant management attention disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we may make investments in complementary companies products or technologies which could involve licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in or acquisitions of other companies for example we completed the acquisitions of awake security in october 2020 and big switch networks in february 2020 which require management to focus efforts on integrating awake security and big switch networks with the company we may not be able to find suitable investment or acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete such investments or acquisitions on favorable terms if at all if we do complete investments or acquisitions we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and any investments or acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end customers investors and securities analysts through acquisitions we continue to expand into new markets and new market segments and we may experience challenges in entering into new market segments for which we have not previously manufactured and sold products including facing exposure to new market risks difficulty achieving expected business results due to a lack of experience in new markets products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar distribution partners or vendors 

in addition investments and acquisitions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures for example if we are unsuccessful at integrating any acquisitions or retaining key talent from those acquisitions or the technologies associated with such acquisitions into our company the business financial condition results of operations and prospects of the combined company could be adversely affected we may have difficulty retaining the employees of any acquired business or the acquired technologies or research and development expectations may prove unsuccessful any integration process may require significant time and resources and we may not be able to manage the process successfully acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel or accurately forecast the financial effects of an acquisition transaction including accounting charges any acquisition or investment could expose us to unknown liabilities moreover we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities we may not be successful in retaining or expanding the customers and sales activities of any acquired business or in realizing the expected operational and cost efficiencies anticipated with the acquisition we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such investment or acquisition each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations moreover if the investment or acquisition becomes impaired we may be required to take an impairment charge which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock 

seasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations 

we operate on a december 31st year end and have typically experienced higher sequential product revenue growth in the fourth quarter followed by flat to declining sequential growth in the first quarter of the following year we believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors including the procurement budgeting and deployment cycles of many of our end customers our rapid historical growth may have reduced the impact of seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date as our increasing size causes our growth rate to slow seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening us dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our end customers outside of the us which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase our product and operating costs in foreign locations further a portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the us is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates if we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with the currency fluctuations our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

if we needed to raise additional capital to expand our operations invest in new products or for other corporate purposes our failure to do so on favorable terms could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future if we did need to raise additional funds to expand our operations invest in new products or for other corporate purposes we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms if we raise additional equity financing our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our common stock could decline furthermore if we engage in debt financing the holders of such debt would have priority over the holders of common stock and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or impose other restrictions on our business we may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders including maintaining specified liquidity or other ratios any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms we may not be able to among other things enhance our products and services expand our sales and marketing and research and development organizations acquire complementary technologies products or businesses and respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

risks related to customers and sales 

if we are unable to attract new large end customers or to sell additional products and services to our existing end customers our revenue growth will be adversely affected and our revenue could decrease 

to increase our revenue we must add new end customers and large end customers and sell additional products and services to existing end customers for example one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our solutions thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers we also believe the opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing infrastructure and expected future spend another one of our sales strategies is focused on increasing penetration in the enterprise and campus markets however sales strategies focused on expansion to adjacent markets can require more time and effort since enterprise and campus end customers typically start with small purchases and there is often a long testing period for this reason in order to grow our revenue it is important for us to attract new large end customers some factors that may limit our ability to attract new large end customers include but are not limited to saturation with certain of the large cloud networking customers competition decreased capital spending of such customers a limited number of such customers and a decline in growth of such customers if we fail to attract new large end customers including enterprise and campus end customers or fail to reduce the sales cycle and sell additional products to our existing end customers our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

we expect large purchases by a limited number of end customers to continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue and any loss delay decline or other change in expected purchases could result in material quartertoquarter fluctuations of our revenue or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue we have experienced unpredictability in the timing of orders from these large end customers primarily due to changes in demand patterns specific to these customers the time it takes these end customers to evaluate test qualify and accept our products and the overall complexity of these large orders we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis for example sales to our end customer microsoft and facebook in fiscal 2019 collectively represented 40 of our total revenue whereas sales to our end customer microsoft in fiscal 2020 amounted to 215 of our revenues with our end customer facebook representing less than 10 of our revenues in the period these changes contributed to a yearoveryear decline in our revenue for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 however this decline in revenue was offset in part by stronger sales to our enterprise and other cloud and service provider customers in addition we typically provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur 

as a consequence of the concentrated nature of our customer base and their purchasing behavior our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate changes in the business requirements or focus upgrade cycles vendor selection project prioritization manner in which spending allocations are assigned among multiple vendors based upon specific network roles or projects financial prospects lack of growth of our customers capital resources and expenditures or purchasing behavior and deceleration in spending of our key end customers could significantly decrease our sales to such end customers or could lead to delays reductions or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services moreover because our sales will be based primarily on purchase orders our customers may cancel delay reduce or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no notice to us this limited visibility regarding our end customers’ product needs the timing and quantity of which could vary significantly requires us to rely on estimated demand forecasts to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages which could lead to delays in fulfilling current and future purchase orders that can impede production by our customers and harm our customer relationships and in the event of a cancellation or reduction of an order we may not have enough time to reduce operating expenses to mitigate the effect of the lost revenue on our business which could materially affect our operating results 

we may be unable to sustain or increase our revenue from our large end customers grow revenues with new or other existing end customers at the rate we anticipate or at all or offset the discontinuation of concentrated purchases by our larger end customers with purchases by new or existing end customers these customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors reassign spending allocations increase their adoption of white box solutions and open source network operating systems demand pricing concessions for our services require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs or reduce their spending levels if these factors drove some of our large customers to cancel all or a portion of their business relationships with us the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and longterm financial forecasts may be materially impacted we expect that such concentrated purchases will continue to contribute materially to our revenue for the foreseeable future and that our results of operations may fluctuate materially as a result of such larger end customers’ buying patterns in addition we may see consolidation of our customer base such as among internet companies and cloud service providers which could result in loss of end customers the loss of such end customers or a significant delay or reduction in their purchases including reductions or delays due to customer departures from recent buying patterns or an unfavorable change in competitive conditions could materially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are unable to increase market awareness of our company and our new products and services our revenue may not continue to grow or may decline 

we have not yet established broad market awareness of our new products and services including new products we introduced in the campus workspace and network security markets market awareness of our value proposition and products and services will be essential to our continued growth and our success particularly for the service provider and broader enterprise markets if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful in creating market awareness of our company and our products and services or in gaining access to new customer markets then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth 

some of our large end customers require more favorable terms and conditions from their vendors and may request price concessions as we seek to sell more products to these end customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenue 

our large end customers have significant purchasing power and as a result may receive more favorable terms and conditions than we typically provide to other end customers including lower prices bundled upgrades extended warranties acceptance terms indemnification terms and extended return policies and other contractual rights as we seek to sell more products to these large end customers an increased mix of our shipments may be subject to such terms and conditions which may reduce our margins or affect the timing of our revenue recognition and thus may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

sales of our switches generate most of our product revenue and if we are unable to continue to grow sales of these products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

historically we have derived substantially all of our product revenue from sales of our switches and we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future we have experienced declines in sales prices for our products including our 10 gigabit ethernet modular and fixed switches a decline in the price of switches and related services or our inability to increase sales of these products would harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects more seriously than if we derived significant revenue from a larger variety of product lines and services our future financial performance will also depend upon successfully developing and selling nextgeneration versions of our switches if we fail to deliver new products new features or new releases that end customers want and that allow us to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

the sales prices of our products and services may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our results of operations 

the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts a change in our mix of products and services the introduction of new products and services by us or by our competitors including the adoption of “white box” solutions promotional programs product and related warranty costs or broader macroeconomic factors in addition we have provided and may in the future provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers 

we have experienced declines in sales prices for our products and services competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and services additionally although we generally price our products and services worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may adversely affect actual prices that partners and end customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore sales prices and gross profits for our products may decrease over product life cycles decreased sales prices for any reason may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our result of operations 

our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense as a result our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly 

the timing of our sales and revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of our products’ sales cycles a sales cycle is the period between initial contact with a prospective end customer and any sale of our products endcustomer orders often involve the purchase of multiple products these orders are complex and difficult to complete because prospective end customers generally consider a number of factors over an extended period of time before committing to purchase the products and solutions we sell end customers especially our large end customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision and require considerable time to evaluate test and qualify our products prior to making a purchase decision and placing an order the length of time that end customers devote to their evaluation contract negotiation and budgeting processes varies significantly in addition customers may delay upgrades to their network infrastructure which extends the upgrade and sales cycle our products’ sales cycles can be lengthy in certain cases especially with respect to our prospective large end customers during the sales cycle we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities and make investments in evaluation equipment all of which lower our operating margins particularly if no sale occurs even if an end customer decides to purchase our products there are many factors affecting the timing of our recognition of revenue which makes our revenue difficult to forecast for example there may be unexpected delays in an end customer’s internal procurement processes particularly for some of our larger end customers for which our products represent a very small percentage of their total procurement activity in addition due to the covid19 pandemic the sales cycle may be extended and there may be delays and reductions of expenditures and cancellations by end customers there are many other factors specific to end customers that contribute to the timing of their purchases and the variability of our revenue recognition including the strategic importance of a particular project to an end customer budgetary constraints and changes in their personnel 

even after an end customer makes a purchase there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase in addition the significance and timing of our product 

enhancements and the introduction of new products by our competitors may also affect end customers’ purchases for all of these reasons it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed the particular period in which a sale will be completed or the period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized if our sales cycles lengthen our revenue could be lower than expected which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings and our failure to offer highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

once our products are deployed within our end customers’ networks our end customers depend on our support organization and our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products highquality support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products if we or our channel partners do not assist our end customers in deploying our products effectively do not succeed in helping our end customers resolve postdeployment issues quickly or do not provide adequate ongoing support or if we experience quality issues with these new products it could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing end customers and could harm our reputation with potential end customers in addition as we expand our operations internationally our support organization will face additional challenges including those associated with delivering support training and documentation in languages other than english our failure or the failure of our channel partners to maintain highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on end customers renewing their maintenance and support contracts any decline in maintenance renewals could harm our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we typically sell our products with maintenance and support as part of the initial purchase and a portion of our annual revenue comes from renewals of maintenance and support contracts our end customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance and support contracts after the expiration of the initial period and they may elect not to renew their maintenance and support contracts to renew their maintenance and support contracts at lower prices through alternative channel partners or to reduce the product quantity under their maintenance and support contracts thereby reducing our future revenue from maintenance and support contracts if our end customers especially our large end customers do not renew their maintenance and support contracts or if they renew them on terms that are less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

our standard sales contracts contain indemnification provisions requiring us to defend our end customers against thirdparty claims including against infringement of certain intellectual property rights that could expose us to losses which could seriously harm our business financial conditions results of operations and prospects 

under the indemnification provisions of our standard sales contracts we agree to defend our end customers and channel partners against thirdparty claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights which may include patents copyrights trademarks or trade secrets and to pay judgments entered on such claims an adverse ruling in such litigation may potentially expose us to claims in the event that claims are brought against our customers based on the ruling and we are required to indemnify such customers 

our exposure under these indemnification provisions is frequently limited to the total amount paid by our end customer under the agreement however certain agreements include indemnification provisions that could potentially expose us to losses in excess of the amount received under the agreement any of these events including claims for indemnification could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in addition to our own direct sales force we rely on distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers to sell our products and our failure to effectively develop manage or prevent disruptions to our distribution channels and the processes and procedures that support them could cause a reduction in the number of end customers of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon maintaining our relationships with distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers and establishing additional sales channel relationships we anticipate that sales of our products to a limited number of channel partners will continue to account for a material portion of our total product revenue for the foreseeable future we provide our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our products but these steps may not be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services if we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive programs for our channel partners we may not be able to incentivize these partners to sell our products to end customers these partners may have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our products altogether one of our channel partners could elect to consolidate or enter into a strategic partnership with one of our competitors which could reduce or eliminate our future opportunities with that channel partner our agreements with our channel partners may generally be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice we may be unable to retain these channel partners or secure additional or replacement channel partners the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners requires extensive training and any new or expanded relationship with a channel partner may take several months or more to achieve productivity 

where we rely on the channel partners for sales of our products we may have little or no contact with the ultimate users of our products that purchase through such channel partners thereby making it more difficult for us to establish brand awareness ensure proper delivery and installation of our products service ongoing endcustomer requirements estimate endcustomer demand and respond to evolving endcustomer needs in addition our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to end customers fail to comply with their contractual obligations or violate laws or our corporate policies if we fail to effectively manage our existing sales channels or if our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our products if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of highquality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

we anticipate increasing our sales efforts to us and foreign federal state and local governmental end customers in the future sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we have attained revised certifications government demand and payment for our products and services may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects selling to government entities may also require us to comply with various regulations that are not applicable to sales to nongovernment entities including regulations that may relate to pricing classified material prohibitions against use of certain foreign components in our products and services and other matters complying with such regulations may also require us to put in place controls and procedures to monitor compliance with the applicable regulations that may be costly or not possible we are not currently certified to perform work under classified contracts with government entities failure to comply with any such regulations could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government ceasing to buy our products and services a reduction of revenue fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the us government may require certain products that it purchases to be manufactured in the us and other relatively highcost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet these requirements any of these and other circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition the us government may require that products it 

purchases contain a certain threshold of “domestic origin” components in order to meet “buy america” requirements 

we are exposed to the credit risk of our channel partners and some of our end customers which could result in material losses 

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with standard payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the us we monitor individual endcustomer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the end customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts we are unable to recognize revenue from shipments until the collection of those amounts becomes reasonably assured any significant delay or default in the collection of significant accounts receivable could result in an increased need for us to obtain working capital from other sources possibly on worse terms than we could have negotiated if we had established such working capital resources prior to such delays or defaults any significant default could adversely affect our results of operations and delay our ability to recognize revenue 

a material portion of our sales is derived through our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers some of our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers may experience financial difficulties which could adversely affect our collection of accounts receivable distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other systems integrators valueadded resellers and end customers distributors represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be less likely to have the reserve resources required to meet payment obligations our exposure to credit risks of our channel partners may increase if our channel partners and their end customers are adversely affected by global or regional economic conditions one or more of these channel partners could delay payments or default on credit extended to them either of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

risks related to products and services 

product quality problems defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate advanced technologies including both hardware and software technologies despite testing prior to their release our products may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products could result in a failure of appropriate updates to be distributed or installed could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could result in warranty claims and product liability claims from customers any actual or perceived defect error or vulnerability in our products or services or other allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in analyzing correcting or redesigning the products or otherwise addressing defects errors or vulnerabilities cause us to lose significant end customers harm our reputation and market positions subject us to liability for damages subject us to litigation regulatory inquiries or investigations and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

from time to time we have had to replace certain components of products that we had shipped and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs including failures in software protocols or defective component batches resulting in reliability issues in such products and we may be required to do so in the future we may also be required to provide full replacements or refunds for such defective products we cannot assure you that such remediation or any of the other circumstances described above including claims litigation or regulatory investigations would not have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance or if we do not successfully manage product introductions we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

we must continue to enhance our existing products and develop new technologies and products that address emerging technological trends evolving industry standards and changing endcustomer needs the process 

of enhancing our existing products and developing new technology is complex and uncertain and new offerings requires significant upfront investment that may not result in material design improvements to existing products or result in marketable new products or costs savings or revenue for an extended period of time if at all 

in addition new technologies could render our existing products obsolete or less attractive to end customers and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if such technologies are widely adopted for example end customers may prefer to address their network switch requirements by licensing software operating systems separately and placing them on “white box” hardware rather than purchasing integrated hardware products as has occurred in the server industry additionally end customers may require product upgrades including higher ethernet speeds and additional functionality to address the increasing demands of the cloud computing environments 

in the past several years we have announced a number of new products and enhancements to our products and services including new products in the campus workspace and network security markets the success of our new products depends on several factors including but not limited to appropriate new product definition the development of product features that sufficiently meet enduser requirements our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues component costs availability of components timely completion and introduction of these products prompt solution of any defects or bugs in these products our ability to support these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products for example our new product releases will require strong execution from our thirdparty merchant silicon chip suppliers to develop and release new merchant silicon chips that satisfy endcustomer requirements to meet expected release schedules and to provide sufficient quantities of these components if we are unable to successfully manage our product introductions or transitions or if we fail to penetrate new markets as a result of any of these or other factors our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

our product releases introduced new software products that include the capability for disaggregation of our software operating systems from our hardware the success of our strategy to expand our software business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the additional development efforts and costs to create these new products or make them compatible with other technologies the potential for our strategy to negatively impact revenues and gross margins and additional costs associated with regulatory compliance 

we may not be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology or endcustomer requirements on a timely basis or at all if we fail to keep up with technology changes or to convince our end customers and potential end customers of the value of our solutions even in light of new technologies we may lose customers decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and services and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products must interoperate with operating systems software applications and hardware that is developed by others and if we are unable to devote the necessary resources to ensure that our products interoperate with such software and hardware we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening demand for our products 

generally our products comprise only a part of the network infrastructure and must interoperate with our end customers’ existing infrastructure specifically their networks servers software and operating systems which may be manufactured by a wide variety of vendors and original equipment manufacturers or oems our products must comply with established industry standards in order to interoperate with the servers storage software and other networking equipment in the network infrastructure such that all systems function efficiently together we depend on the vendors of servers and systems in a data center to support prevailing industry standards often these vendors are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are also some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our end customers 

in addition when new or updated versions of these software operating systems or applications are introduced we must sometimes develop updated versions of our software so that our products will interoperate properly we may not accomplish these development efforts quickly costeffectively or at all these development efforts require capital investment and the devotion of engineering resources if we fail to maintain compatibility with these systems and applications our end customers may not be able to adequately utilize our products and we may 

lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening in demand for our products among other consequences which would adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

risks related to supply chain and manufacturing 

managing the supply of our products and product components is complex insufficient component supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing our extended supply chain is complex and our inventory management systems and related supplychain visibility tools may not enable us to forecast accurately and effectively manage the supply of our products and product components our ability to manage our supply chain may also be adversely affected by other factors including shortages of components used to manufacture our products a reduction or interruption of supply prioritization of component shipments to other vendors cessation of manufacturing of such components by our suppliers and geopolitical conditions such as the us trade war with china and the impact of public health epidemics like the covid19 pandemic insufficient component supply or any increases in the time required to manufacture our products may lead to inventory shortages that could result in increased customer lead times for our products delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential end customers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available in addition the covid19 pandemic has created manufacturing and supply chain disruptions including temporary closures of certain of our contract manufacturer facilities and shortages of certain components and as a result has extended lead times for our products 

in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply from time to time we may issue purchase orders for components and products that are noncancelable and nonreturnable in addition we may purchase components and products that have extended lead teams to ensure adequate supply to support longterm customer demand and mitigate the impact of covid19 related supply disruptions we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our component inventory suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or for products that are considered obsolete in addition we establish a liability and reimburse our contract manufacturer for component inventory purchased on our behalf that has been rendered excess or obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders or in cases where inventory levels greatly exceed our demand forecasts if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory to its estimated realizable value which in turn could result in lower gross margins if we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

because some of the key components in our products come from sole or limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers and may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

our products rely on key components including merchant silicon chips integrated circuit components printed circuit boards connectors customtooled sheet metal and power supplies that we purchase or our contract manufacturers purchase on our behalf from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers generally we do not have guaranteed supply contracts with our component suppliers and our suppliers could suffer shortages delay shipments prioritize shipments to other vendors increase prices or cease manufacturing such products or selling them to us at any time supply of these components may also be adversely affected by industry consolidation which could result in increased component prices or fewer sourcing options as well as geopolitical conditions such as international trade wars like the us trade war with china and the impact of public health epidemics like the covid19 pandemic for example in the past we have experienced shortages in inventory for dynamic random access memory integrated circuits and delayed releases of the next generation of chipset which delayed our production andor the release of our new products we have also recently experienced shortages and delays relating to certain components as a result of manufacturing and supply disruptions due to the covid19 pandemic 

if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner or if we are unable to obtain alternative sources for these components sales of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products any of these events could result in lost sales reduced gross margins or damage to our end customer relationships which would adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our reliance on component suppliers also yields the potential for the infringement or misappropriation of thirdparty intellectual property rights due to the incorporation of such components into our products we may not be indemnified by such component suppliers for such infringement or misappropriation claims any litigation for which we do not receive indemnification could require us to incur significant legal expenses in defending against such claims or require us to pay substantial royalty payments or settlement amounts that would not be reimbursed by our component suppliers 

our product development efforts are also dependent upon the success of our continued collaboration with our key merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap we select specific merchant silicon from these vendors for each new product it is critical that we work in tandem with these vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features that our products take advantage of such improved features and that such vendors are able to supply us with sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable term to meet customer demand reliance on these relationships allows us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies while leveraging their investments and expertise the merchant silicon vendors may not be successful in continuing to innovate meet deadlines for the release of their products or produce a sufficient supply of their products moreover these vendors may not collaborate with us or may become competitive with us by selling merchant silicon for “white boxes” or other products to our customers 

if our key merchant silicon vendors do not continue to innovate if there are delays in the release of their products or supply shortages if they no longer collaborate in such fashion or if such merchant silicon is not offered to us on commercially reasonable terms our products may become less competitive our own product launches could be delayed or we may be required to redesign our products to incorporate alternative merchant silicon which could result in lost sales reduce gross margins damage to our customer relationships or otherwise have a material effect on revenue and business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in the event of a shortage or supply interruption from our component suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner further longterm supply and maintenance obligations to end customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in addition our component suppliers change their selling prices frequently in response to market trends including industrywide increases in demand and because we do not have contracts with these suppliers or guaranteed pricing we are susceptible to availability or price fluctuations related to raw materials and components if we are unable to pass component price increases along to our end customers or maintain stable pricing our gross margins could be adversely affected and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

because we depend on thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping endcustomer orders on time if at all or on a costeffective basis which may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

we depend on thirdparty contract manufacturers to manufacture our product lines a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to these thirdparty contract manufacturers our reliance on these thirdparty contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process quality assurance product costs and product supply and timing which exposes us to risk our reliance on contract manufacturers also yields the potential for their infringement of third party intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of our products or their misappropriation of our intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of other customers’ products if we are unable to manage our relationships with our thirdparty contract manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers suffer delays or disruptions or quality control problems in their operations experience increased manufacturing lead times capacity constraints or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our end customers would be severely impaired and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be seriously harmed 

to the extent that our products are manufactured at facilities in foreign countries we may be subject to additional risks associated with complying with local rules and regulations in those jurisdictions including shelter in place orders issued in connection with the covid19 pandemic for example due to the covid19 pandemic some of our contract manufacturers experienced temporary closures and labor shortages as a result of shelter in place orders similar to the orders currently issued in their local jurisdictions while our manufacturing sites are currently operational further shelter in place orders or factory closures in these or other manufacturing sites would result in material disruptions increased lead times and supply shortages of our products 

our contract manufacturers typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual orders we do not have longterm contracts with our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular pricing terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements which could result in supply shortages and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice for example a competitor could place large orders with the thirdparty manufacturer thereby utilizing all or substantially all of such thirdparty manufacturer’s capacity and leaving the manufacturer little or no capacity to fulfill our individual orders without price increases or delays or at all our contract with one of our contract manufacturers permits it to terminate the agreement for convenience subject to prior notice requirements we may not be able to develop alternate or second contract manufacturers in a timely manner 

if we add or change contract manufacturers or change any manufacturing plant locations within a contract manufacturer network we would add additional complexity and risk to our supply chain management and may increase our working capital requirements ensuring a new contract manufacturer or new plant location is qualified to manufacture our products to our standards and industry requirements could take significant effort and be time consuming and expensive any addition or change in manufacturers may be extremely costly time consuming and we may not be able to do so successfully 

in addition we may be subject to additional significant challenges to ensure that quality processes and costs among other issues are consistent with our expectations and those of our customers a new contract manufacturer or manufacturing location may not be able to scale its production of our products at the volumes or quality we require this could also adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers which could damage our customer relationships and cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end customers late delivery penalties delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins this could also result in increased levels of inventory subjecting us to increased excess and obsolete charges that could have a negative impact on our operating results 

any production interruptions labor shortages or disruptions for any reason including those noted above as well as a natural disaster epidemic such as the covid19 pandemic capacity shortages adverse results from intellectual property litigation or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would adversely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we base our inventory requirements on our forecasts of future sales if these forecasts are materially inaccurate we may procure inventory that we may be unable to use in a timely manner or at all 

we and our contract manufacturers procure components and build our products based on our forecasts these forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products which are in turn based on historical trends and analysis from our sales and marketing organizations adjusted for overall market conditions and other factors to the extent our forecasts are materially inaccurate or if we otherwise do not need such inventory we may under or overprocure inventory and such inaccuracies in our forecasts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to intellectual property and other proprietary rights 

assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights or other lawsuits asserted against us could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network infrastructure network security and wifi industries and have resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies many companies in the network infrastructure network security and wifi industries including our competitors and other third parties as well as nonpracticing entities own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us from time to time they have or may in the future also assert such claims against us our end customers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties for example we have previously been involved in litigation with cisco and optumsoft 

as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur or if we enter into new markets claims of infringement misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase any claim of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim distract our management from our business and require us to cease use of such intellectual property in addition some claims for patent infringement may relate to subcomponents that we purchase from third parties if these third parties are unable or unwilling to indemnify us for these claims we could be substantially harmed 

the patent portfolios of most of our competitors are larger than ours this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent crosslicenses in addition future assertions of patent rights by third parties and any resulting litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection we cannot assure you that we are not infringing or otherwise violating any thirdparty intellectual property rights 

the thirdparty asserters of intellectual property claims may be unreasonable in their demands or may simply refuse to settle which could lead to expensive settlement payments longer periods of litigation and related expenses additional burdens on employees or other resources distraction from our business supply stoppages and lost sales 

an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay substantial damages or penalties including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party’s patents cease making licensing using or importing into the us products or services that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others expend additional development resources to attempt to redesign our products or services or otherwise to develop noninfringing technology which may not be successful enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or intellectual property rights and indemnify our partners and other third parties any damages penalties or royalty obligations we may become subject to as a result of an adverse outcome and any thirdparty indemnity we may need to provide could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects royalty or licensing agreements if required or desirable may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures further there is little or no information publicly available concerning market or fair values for license fees which can lead to overpayment of license or settlement fees in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us suppliers subject to thirdparty intellectual property claims also may choose or be forced to discontinue or alter their arrangements with us with little or no advance notice to us any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in the event that we are found to infringe any third party intellectual property we could be enjoined or subject to other remedial orders that would prohibit us from making licensing using or importing into the us such products or services in order to resume such activities with respect to any affected products or services we or our component suppliers would be required to develop technical redesigns to this third party intellectual property that no longer infringe the third party intellectual property in any efforts to develop technical redesigns for these products or services we or our component suppliers may be unable to do so in a manner that does not continue to infringe the third party intellectual property or that is acceptable to our customers these redesign efforts could be extremely costly and time consuming as well as disruptive to our other development activities and distracting to management moreover such redesigns could require us to obtain approvals from the court or administrative body to resume the activities with respect to these affected solutions we may not be successful in our efforts to obtain such approvals in a timely manner or at all any failure to effectively redesign our solutions or to obtain timely approval of those redesigns by a court or administrative body may cause a disruption to our product shipments and materially and adversely affect our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition for example in two prior investigations brought by cisco in the international trade commission “itc” we were subjected to remedial orders that prohibited us from importing and selling after importation any products the itc found to infringe cisco’s patents as a result we were required to redesign certain aspects of our products and obtain us customs and border protection’s approval of those redesigns before we could continue to import those products into the united states 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights 

we depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology we rely on trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection 

the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner we may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions further we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims to the extent that additional patents are issued from our patent applications which is not certain they may be contested circumvented or invalidated in the future moreover the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages and as with any technology competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future in addition we rely on confidentiality or license agreements with third parties in connection with their use of our products and technology there is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements or that we will be able to adequately enforce our rights in part because we rely on “shrinkwrap” licenses in some instances 

we have not registered our trademarks in all geographic markets failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our ability to enforce and defend our trademark rights and result in indemnification claims further any claim of infringement by a third party even those claims without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claim could divert management attention from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property in certain geographic markets 

despite our efforts the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the united states 

detecting and protecting against the unauthorized use of our products technology and proprietary rights is expensive difficult and in some cases impossible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources either of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and there is no guarantee that we would be successful furthermore many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to protecting their technology or intellectual property rights than we do accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property which could result in a substantial loss of our market share 

we rely on the availability of licenses to thirdparty software and other intellectual property 

many of our products and services include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties and we otherwise use software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties in our business this exposes us to risks over which we may have little or no control for example a licensor may have difficulties keeping up with technological changes or may stop supporting the software or other intellectual property that it licenses to us also it will be necessary in the future to renew licenses expand the scope of existing licenses or seek new licenses relating to various aspects of these products and services or otherwise relating to our business which may result in increased license fees these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms if at all in addition a third party may assert that we or our end customers are in breach of the terms of a license which could among other things give such third party the right to terminate a license or seek damages from us or both the inability to obtain or maintain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain or maintain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in releases of products and services and could otherwise disrupt our business until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and services or otherwise in the conduct of our business moreover the inclusion in our products and services of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive 

basis may limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software that we use if we combine our software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release portions of the source code of our software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products moreover we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products will be effective if we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products on terms that are not economically feasible to reengineer our products to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available in source code form our proprietary code any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we provide access to our software and other selected source code to certain partners which creates additional risk that our competitors could develop products that are similar to or better than ours 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our internally developed technology which is incorporated in the source code for our products we seek to protect the source code design code documentation and other information relating to our software under trade secret patent and copyright laws however we have chosen to provide access to selected source code of our software to several of our partners for codevelopment as well as for open application programming interfaces apis formats and protocols though we generally control access to our source code and other intellectual property and enter into confidentiality or license agreements with such partners as well as with our employees and consultants this combination of procedural and contractual safeguards may be insufficient to protect our trade secrets and other rights to our technology our protective measures may be inadequate especially because we may not be able to prevent our partners employees or consultants from violating any agreements or licenses we may have in place or abusing their access granted to our source code improper disclosure or use of our source code could help competitors develop products similar to or better than ours 

risks related to litigation 

we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 

from time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent copyright commercial product liability employment class action whistleblower and other litigation in addition to governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources cause us to incur significant expenses or liability andor require us to change our business practices for example we were previously involved in litigation with cisco and optumsoft because of the potential risks expenses and uncertainties of litigation we may from time to time settle disputes even where we have meritorious claims or defenses although we have insurance which may provide coverage for some kinds of claims we may face that insurance may not cover some kinds of claims or types of relief and may not be adequate in a particular case because litigation is inherently unpredictable we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

for more information regarding the litigation in which we have been involved see the “legal proceedings” subheading in note 7 commitments and contingencies of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k incorporated herein by reference 

risks related to cybersecurity and data privacy 

defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products the failure of our products to detect security breaches the misuse of our products or the risks of product liability could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operating results 

our products services and internal network systems could become a target for security attacks including attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and our customers and introduce malicious software and attacks by state sponsors if our products services or internal networks system or data are or are perceived to have been compromised our reputation may be damaged and our financial results may be negatively affected 

organizations are increasingly subject to a wide variety of attacks on their networks systems endpoints products and services and no security solution including our security platform can address all possible security threats or block all methods of penetrating a network products and services or otherwise perpetrating a security incident additionally any defects errors or vulnerabilities in our security platform or in the hardware upon which it is deployed including a failure to implement updates to such platform could temporarily or permanently limit our detection capabilities and expose our endcustomers’ networks leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats if customers of our security platform do suffer a data security incident or data breach even if it is not attributable to a failure of our platform to identify any threat or vulnerability customers may believe that our platform failed to detect a threat or vulnerability which could harm our reputation or negatively affect our financial results 

the classifications of application type virus spyware vulnerability exploits data or url categories by our security platform may also falsely detect report and act on applications content or threats that do not actually exist these false positives may impair the perceived reliability of our security platform and may therefore adversely impact market acceptance of our security platform any such false identification of important files or applications could result in damage to our reputation negative publicity loss of channel partners endcustomers and sales increased costs to remedy any problem and costly litigation 

breaches of our cybersecurity systems or other security breaches or incidents with respect to our products services networks systems or data could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services to our customers delay our ability to recognize revenue compromise the integrity of our software products and our networks systems and data result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property damage our reputation expose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data 

we increasingly depend upon our it systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners computer programmers or other persons or organizations may attempt to penetrate our network security or that of our website or systems and access or obtain confidential personal or otherwise sensitive or proprietary information about us or our customers or cause interruptions of our service these risks may increase due to the current covid19 pandemic because the techniques used to access or sabotage networks and systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition our software and sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could cause the software or applications to fail or otherwise to unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system we face risks of others gaining unauthorized access to our products and services and introducing malicious software we have also outsourced a number of our business functions to thirdparties including our manufacturers logistics providers and cloud service providers and our business operations also depend in part on the success of these third parties’ own cybersecurity measures similarly we rely upon distributors resellers and system integrators to sell our products and our sales operations depend in part on the reliability of their cybersecurity measures additionally we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our it resources with the use of security measures designed to prevent exposure of our network systems to security breaches and the loss of data we and all of the aforementioned 

third parties also face the risk of malicious software phishing schemes and other social engineering methods fraud and other malfeasance cybersecurity threats from state sponsors and intentional or negligent acts or omissions of employees and contractors furthermore our acquisition of awake security and our provision of its ndr platform may result in us being a more attractive target for such attacks accordingly if our cybersecurity systems and measures or those of any of the aforementioned third parties fail to protect against sophisticated cyberattacks the mishandling of data by employees and contractors or any other means of unauthorized access to or use of our manufacturing process products services networks systems or data that we or such third parties maintain operate or process our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways including 

• sensitive data regarding our business or our customers including intellectual property and other proprietary data could be stolen 

• our electronic communications systems including email and other methods or other systems could be disrupted and our ability to conduct our business operations could be seriously damaged until such systems can be restored which we may be unable to achieve in a prompt manner or at all 

• our ability to process customer orders and electronically deliver products and services could be degraded and our distribution channels could be disrupted resulting in delays in revenue recognition 

• defects and security vulnerabilities could be introduced into our software thereby damaging the reputation and perceived reliability and security of our products and potentially making the data systems of our customers vulnerable to further data loss and cyber incidents 

• our manufacturing process products services supply chain network systems and data could be corrupted and 

• personal data of our customers employees contractors and business partners could be accessed obtained or used without authorization or otherwise compromised 

should any of the above events occur or be perceived to occur we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our customers and others and regulatory investigations and actions from governmental agencies and we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to remediate and otherwise address any data security incident or breach including to notify individuals entities or regulatory bodies and to implement measures in an effort to prevent further breaches or incidents in addition our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised and our reputation and competitive position could be significantly harmed also the regulatory and contractual actions litigation investigations fines penalties and liabilities relating to data breaches that result in losses of damage or destruction of or unauthorized access to or acquisition of credit card information or other personal or sensitive data of users of our services can be significant in terms of fines and reputational impact and necessitate changes to our business operations that may be disruptive to us additionally we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and other measures in an effort to prevent security breaches and other incidents even the perception of inadequate security may damage our reputation and negatively impact our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers consequently our financial performance and results of operations could be adversely affected by any of the foregoing types of security breaches incidents vulnerabilities or other matters or the perception that any of them have occurred 

in addition we cannot assure that any limitation of liability provisions in our customer agreements contracts with thirdparty vendors and service providers or other contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other securityrelated matter we also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all or that any future claim will not be excluded or otherwise be denied coverage by any insurer the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business including our reputation financial condition and operating results 

risks related to accounting compliance regulation and tax 

if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

assessing our processes procedures and staffing in order to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes many of which are done manually and are dependent upon individual data input or review these processes include but are not limited to calculating revenue inventory costs and the preparation of our statement of cash flows while we continue to automate our processes and enhance our review controls to reduce the likelihood for errors we expect that for the foreseeable future many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect or if there is a change in accounting principles our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes a change in these principles or interpretations could harm our revenue and financial results and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change in addition we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as described in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 of this annual report on form 10k the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities equity revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation and contract manufacturersupplier liabilities income taxes and loss contingencies if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions our results of operations may be adversely affected and may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

enhanced united states tax tariff importexport restrictions chinese regulations or other trade barriers may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

there is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united states and various other countries most significantly china with respect to trade policies treaties tariffs and taxes in 2018 the office of the us trade representative the “ustr” enacted a tariff of 10 on imports into the us from china including communications equipment products and components manufactured and imported from china since then additional tariffs have been imposed by the ustr on imports into the united states from china and china has also imposed tariffs on imports into china from the united states although the united states and china signed an interim trade agreement in january 2020 the parties are continuing to negotiate a trade agreement 

in addition due to concerns with the security of products and services from certain telecommunications and video providers based in china us congress has enacted bans on the use of certain chineseorigin components or systems either in items sold to the us government or in the internal networks of government contractors and subcontractors even if those networks are not used for governmentrelated projects further the chinese government has responded to these us actions by indicating its intention to develop an unreliable entity list which may limit the ability of companies on the list to engage in business with chinese customers 

if tariffs trade restrictions or trade barriers remain in place or if new tariffs trade restrictions or trade barriers are placed on products such as ours by us or foreign governments especially china our costs may increase we believe we can adjust our supply chain and manufacturing practices to minimize the impact of the tariffs but our efforts may not be successful there can be no assurance that we will not experience a disruption in our business related to these or other changes in trade practices and the process of changing suppliers in order to mitigate any such tariff costs could be complicated timeconsuming and costly 

the us tariffs may also cause customers to delay orders as they evaluate where to take delivery of our products in connection with their efforts to mitigate their own tariff exposure such delays create forecasting difficulties for us and increase the risk that orders might be canceled or might never be placed current or future 

tariffs imposed by the us may also negatively impact our customers sales thereby causing an indirect negative impact on our own sales even in the absence of further tariffs the related uncertainty and the markets fear of an escalating trade war might cause our distributors and customers to place fewer orders for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity financial condition andor results of operations 

given the relatively fluid regulatory environment in china and the united states and uncertainty how the us government or foreign governments will act with respect to tariffs international trade agreements and policies a trade war further governmental action related to tariffs or international trade policies or additional tax or other regulatory changes in the future could directly and adversely impact our financial results and results of operations 

changes in our income taxes or our effective tax rate enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application of existing tax laws of various jurisdictions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including earnings that are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our ability to generate and use tax attributes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the federal research and development “rd” tax credit laws transfer pricing adjustments tax effects of nondeductible compensation including certain stockbased compensation tax costs related to intercompany realignments changes in accounting principles imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries or customers or a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain foreign earnings 

significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions and determine our income tax liability the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect income taxes or additional paidin capital in addition tax laws are dynamic and subject to change changes in tax laws and regulations and interpretations of such laws and regulations including taxation of earnings outside of the us the introduction of a base erosion antiabuse tax and the disallowance of tax deductions for certain expense as well as changes that may be enacted in the future could impact the tax treatment of our earnings and cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies or rates in various jurisdictions including the united states may be subject to significant change 

finally we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities audits by the irs or other tax authorities are subject to inherent uncertainties and could result in unfavorable outcomes including potential fines or penalties as we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions the expense of defending and resolving such an audit may be significant the amount of time to resolve an audit is also unpredictable and may divert management’s attention from our business operations we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our income taxes we cannot assure you that fluctuations in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application or interpretation of existing tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns by tax authorities will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business is subject to regulation by various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety environmental laws consumer protection laws privacy data protection antibribery laws importexport controls conflict minerals federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the united states for example the eu has implemented the general data protection regulation “gdpr” the gdpr provides for substantial obligations relating to the handling storage and other processing of data relating to individuals and administrative fines for violations which can be up four percent of the previous year’s annual revenue or €20 million whichever is higher we have relied on the euus and swissus privacy shield programs and the use of model contractual clauses approved by the eu commission to legitimize these transfers both the euus privacy shield and these model 

contractual clauses have been subject to legal challenge we continue to analyze the july 2020 “schrems ii” decision by the court of justice of the european union and its impact on our data transfer mechanisms as well as subsequent guidance from data privacy regulators the effects of this decision are uncertain and difficult to predict among other effects we may experience additional costs associated with increased compliance burdens and new contract negotiations with third parties that aid in processing data on our behalf we may experience reluctance or refusal by current or prospective european customers to use our products and we may find it necessary or desirable to make further changes to our handling of personal data of residents of the european economic area “eea” the regulatory environment applicable to the handling of eea residents’ personal data and our actions taken in response may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs and could result in our business operating results and financial condition being harmed additionally we and our customers may face a risk of enforcement actions by data protection authorities in the eea relating to personal data transfers to us and by us from the eea any such enforcement actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources distract management and technical personnel and negatively affect our business operating results and financial condition further the uk has implemented legislation that substantially provides for the gdpr which provides for fines of up to the greater of 175 million british pounds or four percent of the previous year’s annual revenue whichever is higher the relationship between the uk and the eu in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear following the uk’s exit from the eu including with respect to regulation of data transfers between eu member states and the uk 

several jurisdictions have passed new laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and other matters and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” became operative on january 1 2020 the ccpa requires covered companies to among other things provide new disclosures to california consumers and affords such consumers new abilities to optout of certain sales of personal information certain aspects of the ccpa and its interpretation remain uncertain and are likely to remain uncertain for an extended period further a new privacy law the california privacy rights act “cpra” was approved by the votes in the november 3 2020 election the cpra modifies the ccpa significantly creating obligations relating to consumer data beginning on january 1 2022 with implementing regulations expected on or before july 1 2022 and enforcement beginning july 1 2023 passage of the cpra has resulted has resulted in further uncertainty and may require us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply in addition some countries are considering or have enacted legislation requiring local storage and processing of data that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services accordingly we cannot predict the full impact of the ccpa the cpra or other evolving privacy and data protection obligations on our business or operations complying with emerging and changing legal and regulatory requirements relating to privacy data protection and other matters may cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes including the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection recycling and disposal of electrical and electronic equipment our failure or the failure of our partners including our contract manufacturers to comply with past present and future environmental laws could result in fines penalties thirdparty claims reduced sales of our products reengineering our products substantial product inventory writeoffs and reputational damage any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we also expect that our business will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis applicable to us and our partners including our contract manufacturers to date our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows although we cannot predict the future effect of such laws or regulations they will likely result in additional costs or require us to change the content or manufacturing of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

from time to time we may receive inquiries from governmental agencies or we may make voluntary disclosures regarding our compliance with applicable governmental regulations or requirements relating to various matters including importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations which could lead to formal investigations actual or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or other governmental requirements could lead to regulatory investigations enforcement actions and other proceedings private claims and litigation and potentially may subject us to sanctions mandatory product recalls enforcement actions disgorgement 

of profits fines damages civil and criminal penalties or injunctions if any governmental fines penalties or other sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected in addition responding to any investigation action or other proceeding will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees enforcement actions investigations and fines penalties and other sanctions could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls 

our products may be subject to various export controls and because we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products certain of our products may be exported from various countries only with the required export license or through an export license exception if we were to fail to comply with the applicable export control laws customs regulations economic sanctions or other applicable laws we could be subject to monetary damages or the imposition of restrictions which could be material to our business operating results and prospects and could also harm our reputation further there could be criminal penalties for knowing or willful violations including incarceration for culpable employees and managers obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities furthermore certain export control and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products technology software and services to embargoed countries and sanctioned governments entities and persons even though we take precautions to ensure that we and our channel partners comply with all relevant regulations any failure by us or our channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences including reputational harm government investigations and penalties 

as our company grows we also continue developing procedures and controls to comply with export control and other applicable laws historically we have had some instances where we inadvertently have not fully complied with certain export control laws but we have disclosed them to and implemented corrective actions with the appropriate government agencies 

in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including through import permit and license requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our end customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential end customers with international operations or create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the value of your investment could decline 

the trading price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include but are not limited to forwardlooking statements related to future revenue gross margins and earnings per share changes or decreases in our growth rate manufacturing supply or distribution shortages or constraints ratings changes by securities analysts actual or anticipated announcements of new products by our company or our competitors litigation actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations regulatory developments repurchases of our common stock departures of key executives major catastrophic events and broad market and industry fluctuations 

in addition technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility and if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us in the past following periods of volatility in 

the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company if the market price of our common stock is volatile we may become the target of securities litigation securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business and prospects this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we have adopted a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock however any future decisions to reduce or discontinue repurchasing our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program any determination to execute our stock repurchase program will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital requirements and other factors as well as our board of director’s continuing determination that the repurchase program is in the best interests of our shareholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase program our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock if we fail to meet any expectations related to stock repurchases the market price of our common stock could decline and could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence additionally price volatility of our common stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our common stock to exceed the stock’s market price at a given point in time 

we may further increase or decrease the amount of repurchases of our common stock in the future any reduction or discontinuance by us of repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our current share repurchase authorization program could cause the market price of our common stock to decline moreover in the event repurchases of our common stock are reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume repurchasing common stock at historical levels could result in a lower market valuation of our common stock 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that such sales might occur could reduce the market price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us based on shares outstanding as of december 31 2020 holders of approximately 219  of our common stock have rights subject to some conditions to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders in addition we have registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans if holders by exercising their registration rights sell large numbers of shares it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

insiders have substantial control over us which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions including a change of control 

our directors executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 10 of our outstanding common stock together with their affiliates in the aggregate beneficially own approximately 218 of the outstanding shares of our common stock based on shares outstanding as of december 31 2020 as a result these stockholders if acting together could exercise a significant level of influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests this concentration of ownership may also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock or otherwise may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change of control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock 

our charter documents and delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

• a classified board of directors with threeyear staggered terms which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors 

• the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares including preferences and voting rights without stockholder approval which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer 

• the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation death or removal of a director which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors 

• a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders 

• the requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors our president our secretary or a majority vote of our board of directors which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action including the removal of directors 

• the requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 23 of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock voting together as a single class to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt 

• the ability of our board of directors by majority vote to amend the bylaws which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt and 

• advance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 

in addition as a delaware corporation we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law these provisions may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time 

general risks 

if we are unable to hire retain train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel particularly software engineering and sales personnel in addition our success in expanding into adjacent markets including the enterprise market requires a significant investment of time effort and financial resources into hiring and training our sales force to address these markets if we do not effectively train our direct sales force we may be unable to add new end customers increase sales to our existing end customers and successfully expand into new markets competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense especially in the san francisco bay area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have to provide more attractive compensation packages and other amenities research and development personnel are aggressively recruited by startup and growth companies which are especially active in many of the technical areas and geographic regions in which we conduct product development in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the hightechnology industry job candidates often consider the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to attract motivate or retain key employees in addition our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing 

contributions of our senior management to execute our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations our employment arrangements with our employees do not generally require that they continue to work for us for any specified period and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time if we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel or if there are delays in hiring required personnel our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be seriously harmed

overview 

arista networks pioneered softwaredriven cognitive cloud networking for largescale data center and campus workspace environments our industryleading cloud networking platform is highly scalable and programmable and purpose built to address the functional and performance requirements for cloud networks including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has further allowed us to integrate rapidly with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services 

we generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching and routing platforms which incorporate our eos software and related network applications we also generate revenue from post contract support or pcs which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products and renewals of pcs we sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others 

historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue we have experienced unpredictability in the timing of orders from these large end customers primarily due to changes in demand patterns specific to these customers the time it takes these end customers to evaluate test qualify and accept our products and the overall complexity of these large orders we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis for example sales to our end customers microsoft and facebook in fiscal 2019 collectively represented 40 of our total revenue whereas sales to our end customer microsoft in fiscal 2020 amounted to 215 of our revenues with our end customer facebook representing less than 10 of our revenues in the period these changes contributed to a yearoveryear decline in our revenue for fiscal 2020 however this decline in revenue from these large end customers was in part offset by stronger sales to our enterprise and other cloud and service provider customers in addition we typically provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur 

we believe that cloud networking will continue to replace legacy network technologies across data center and campus environments our cloud networking platforms are well positioned to address the growing cloud networking market and to address increasing performance requirements driven by the growing number of connected devices as well as the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications 

the markets for cloud networking solutions are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology changing endcustomer needs evolving industry standards frequent introductions of new products and services and industry consolidation we expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for cloud networking expands and existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products our future success is dependent upon our ability to continue to evolve and adapt to our rapidly changing environment we must also continue to develop market leading products and features that address the needs of our existing and new customers and increase sales in the enterprise data center switching and campus workspace markets we intend to continue expanding our sales force and marketing activities in key geographies as well as our relationships with channel technology and systemlevel partners in order to reach new end customers more effectively increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support in addition we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our ability to rapidly develop new features and applications 

our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our eos software and enhancements to eos we engineer our products to be agnostic with respect to the underlying merchant silicon architecture today we combine our eos software with merchant silicon into a family of switching and routing products this enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions we work closely with third party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third party direct fulfillment facilities we and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling final configuration quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers 

recent developments 

the global coronavirus “covid19” pandemic and related shelter in place travel and social distancing restrictions imposed by governments around the world in an effort to contain or slow its spread have negatively impacted the global economy disrupted business sales activities supply chains and workforce participation including our own and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets and we expect that the global health crisis caused by covid19 will continue to negatively impact business activity for the foreseeable future 

we have taken numerous steps and will continue to take further actions in our approach to address covid19 we have prioritized the protection of our employees during this pandemic and as a result have closed our offices across the globe including our corporate headquarters limiting access to only those employees providing essential activities instructed employees to work from home and implemented travel restrictions we continue to work closely with our contract manufacturers and supply chain partners who have experienced delays in component sourcing workforce disruptions and governmental restrictions on the production and export of their products although we have worked diligently to drive improvements in these areas including funding additional working capital and incremental purchase commitments these delays have negatively impacted our ability to supply products to our customers on a timely basis we expect to continue to invest in working capital as supply availability improves in order to address the risk of future covid19 related supply chain disruptions but we cannot be certain that such disruptions will not occur when the covid19 pandemic began we initially experienced some volatility in customer demand but sales activity subsequently stabilized and we experienced incremental improvements in overall demand as the year progressed however the supply chain disruptions outlined above and the earlier volatility in customer demand contributed in part to a yearoveryear decline in total revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 

the extent of the impact of covid19 on our operational and financial performance including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the pandemic the breadth and duration of governmental containment measures such as shelter in place travel and social distancing restrictions as well as the reauthorization of or increase in such measures in the event of spikes in covid19 infection rates the success of the covid19 vaccination deployment and the impact on our customers partners contract manufacturers 

and supply chain all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted however any continued or renewed disruption in manufacturing and supply resulting from the covid19 pandemic or related containment measures could negatively impact our business we also believe that any extended or renewed covid19 related economic disruption could have a negative impact on demand from our customers in future periods accordingly current results and financial condition discussed herein may not be indicative of future operating results and trends 

in response to potential future covid19 related disruptions to our business we have continued to carefully review our investment and spending plans cautiously increasing incremental spending in the second half of fiscal 2020 as overall customer demand stabilized although management is actively monitoring the impact of covid19 on the company’s financial condition liquidity operations suppliers industry and workforce the full impact of the pandemic continues to evolve as of the date of this report as such the company is unable to estimate the effects of covid19 on its future results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

acquisitions 

on february 5 2020 we acquired big switch networks inc “big switch” a network monitoring and softwaredefined networking pioneer headquartered in santa clara california with the acquisition of big switch we expanded our data center networking solutions and further strengthen our network monitoring and observability suite delivered through arista’s software platform cloudvision and danz dataanalyzer capabilities in addition on october 7 2020 we completed the acquisition of awake security inc “awake security” a network detection and response “ndr” platform provider headquartered in santa clara california with the acquisition of awake security we added an ndr platform to our product portfolio that combines artificial intelligence ai with human expertise to autonomously hunt for and respond to insider and external threats 

results of operations 

year ended december 31 2020 compared to year ended december 31 2019 

revenue cost of revenue and gross profit in thousands except percentages 



revenue by geography in thousands except percentages 



revenue 

product revenue primarily consists of sales of our switching and routing products and software licenses service revenue is primarily derived from sales of postcontract support or pcs which is typically purchased in conjunction with our products and subsequent renewals of those contracts we expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on among other things the timing size and complexity of orders especially with respect to our large end customers 

product revenue decreased 1903 million or 94 in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease was primarily due to the recognition of 1251 million of deferred product revenue in the year ended december 31 2019 related to customer acceptance of products shipped in prior periods in addition we experienced reduced sales to our larger customers during fiscal 2020 combined with the impact of some covid19 related supply constraints service revenue increased 971 million or 249 in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand international revenues remained relatively constant at 235 of total revenues in the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 239 in 2019 with a slight decrease in growth in our emea region mostly offset by an increase in growth in our asiapacific region international revenue generally fluctuates based on the timing of deployments by certain of our large end customers 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

cost of product revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our thirdparty contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors overhead costs of our manufacturing operations and other costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory cost of service revenue primarily consists of personnel and other costs associated with our global customer support and services organizations 

cost of revenue decreased 307 million or 35 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 the decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to a corresponding decrease in product revenues and was partially offset by incremental covid19 related supply chain costs and increased product transition costs 

gross margin or gross profit as a percentage of revenue has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition the mix of sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing manufacturingrelated costs including costs associated with supply chain sourcing activities merchant silicon costs the mix of products sold and excessobsolete inventory writedowns including charges for excessobsolete component inventory held by our contract manufacturers we expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above 

gross margin slightly decreased from 641 for the year ended december 31 2019 to 639 in 2020 gross margin was negatively impacted by incremental covid19 related supply chain costs and some increased product transition costs combined with the impact of fixed overhead costs on a lower revenue base these negative impacts were partially offset by a reduction in sales to our larger end customers who generally receive larger discounts and improved service margins as we scale our services organization 

operating expenses in thousands except percentages 

our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs personnel costs consist of wages benefits bonuses and with respect to sales and marketing expenses sales commissions personnel costs also include stockbased compensation and travel expenses 



research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs prototype expenses thirdparty engineering costs and an allocated portion of facility and it costs our research and development efforts are focused on new product development and maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products including new releases and upgrades to our eos software and applications we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership 

research and development expenses increased 238 million or 52 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 the increase was primarily due to a 268 million increase in stockbased compensation from new and refresh grants during the current fiscal year and a 78 million increase in acquisitionrelated expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets from our acquisition of big switch and awake security partially offset by an 114 million decrease in new product introduction costs including thirdparty engineering and other product development costs 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs marketing trade shows and other promotional activities and an allocated portion of facility and it costs we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide 

sales and marketing expenses increased 155 million or 72 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 the increase was driven by increased headcount resulting in increased compensation costs including salaries and stockbased compensation partially offset by a decrease in travel and other sales and marketing activities due to covid19 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and professional services costs general and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive finance human resources and legal functions our professional services costs are primarily related to external legal accounting and tax services 

general and administrative expenses increased 43 million or 70 for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 the increase was primarily driven by acquisitionrelated costs from our acquisitions of big switch and awake security in the current fiscal year 

other income net in thousands except percentages 

other income net consists primarily of interest income from our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities gains and losses on our investments in privatelyheld companies and foreign currency transaction gains and losses we expect other income net may fluctuate in the future as a result of the remeasurement of our private company equity investments upon the occurrence of observable price changes andor impairments changes in interest rates or returns on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 



the unfavorable change in other income net during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 was driven by a 240 million decrease in interest income largely due to lower interest rates this was partially offset by a realized gain of 94 million on the sale of marketable securities in the third quarter of the year ended december 31 2020 

provision for income taxes in thousands except percentages 

we operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to local country income tax and may also be subject to us income tax generally our us tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these foreign earnings which avoids double taxation our tax expense to date consists of federal state and foreign current and deferred income taxes 



for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we recorded an expense of 1043 million and 24 million for income taxes respectively and our effective tax rate increased from 03 in 2019 to 141 in 2020 the change in our income taxes was largely attributable to a net tax benefit of 86 million in 2019 resulting from an intraentity transaction to sell our nonamericas economic and beneficial intellectual property rights further while we experienced a decrease in worldwide profit before tax in 2020 compared to 2019 the tax benefits attributable to stockbased compensation also decreased along with an increase in foreign earnings taxed in nonzero rate jurisdictions resulting in overall higher tax expense for further information regarding income taxes and the impact on our results of operations and financial position refer to note 10 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

revenue cost of revenue and gross profit in thousands except percentages 



revenue by geography in thousands except percentages 



revenue 

product revenue increased 1801 million or 98 in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 the increase was primarily driven by increased demand from both new and existing customers and the recognition of product deferred revenue related to sales in the prior year for which revenue was recognized in 2019 service revenue increased 793 million or 256 in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base has continued to expand international revenues represented 239 of total revenues in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 279 in 2018 which was primarily due to a move toward us deployments by certain of our large end customers during 2019 we continue to experience pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition but demand for our products and growth in our installed base has more than offset this pricing pressure during the year however we have experienced reduced and volatile demand from certain of our large end customers during 2019 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

cost of revenue increased 884 million or 114 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to the corresponding increases in product and service revenues 

gross margin increased to 641 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 638 in 2018 the increase in gross margin was primarily driven by an increase in product margins due to favorable customer mix with lower discounts on smaller volume transactions partially offset by increased product transition costs including excess and obsolete inventoryrelated charges 

operating expenses in thousands except percentages 



research and development 

research and development expenses increased 203 million or 46 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 the increase was primarily due to a 172 million increase in personnel costs driven primarily by headcount growth and a 78 million increase in developmentrelated facilities costs due to facilities expansion and headcount growth partially offset by a 59 million decrease in new product introduction costs including thirdparty engineering and other product development costs 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses increased 268 million or 143 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 the increase primarily included a 234 million increase in personnel costs which was driven by increased headcount as well as higher sales volumes resulting in increased compensation costs including commissions and stockbased compensation 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses decreased 35 million or 54 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 the decrease was primarily related to a reduced level of litigation activity as a result of the settlement of our litigation with cisco in august 2018 

legal settlement 

during the three months ended june 30 2018 we recorded 4050 million in legal settlement expenses in connection with the term sheet that was entered into on august 6 2018 between the company and cisco which included a 4000 million payment and 50 million of legal fees associated with the settlement pursuant to the term sheet the company and cisco obtained dismissals of all then ongoing district court and usitc litigation between us on december 3 2018 the parties entered into a mutual release and settlement agreement which superseded the term sheet but did not substantially alter the terms 

other income net in thousands except percentages 



the favorable change in other income net during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to 2018 was driven by a 195 million increase in interest income as we continued to generate cash and expand our marketable securities portfolios and a 192 million favorable change on our investments in privatelyheld companies resulting from the gain on certain investments of 54 million in 2019 compared to a net loss of 138 million on these investments during 2018 upon adoption of accounting standard codification topic 842  leases “asc 842” on january 1 2019 we derecognized the finance lease obligation associated with our buildtosuit lease and therefore ceased to incur further interest expense as it relates to this obligation 

provision for benefit from income taxes in thousands except percentages 



for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 we recorded an expense of 24 million and a benefit of 393 million for income taxes respectively the change in our income taxes was largely attributable to a 969 million tax benefit from the cisco settlement in 2018 and an overall increase in worldwide earnings in 2019 partially offset by a net tax benefit of 86 million in 2019 resulting from an intraentity transaction to sell our nonamericas economic and beneficial intellectual property rights 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations as of december 31 2020 our total balance of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 29 billion of which approximately 4210 million was held outside the us in our foreign subsidiaries 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general business purposes including the funding of working capital our marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highlyrated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss we plan to continue to invest for longterm growth we believe that our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings our costs associated with supply chain activities including access to outsourced manufacturing our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies the continued market acceptance of our products and stock repurchases if we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected

during the year ended december 31 2019 cash provided by operating activities was 9630 million primarily from net income of 8599 million and net noncash adjustments to net income of 624 million partially offset by a net decrease of 408 million in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities cash outflows from operating activities consisted of an 119 million decrease in deferred revenue primarily due to the recognition of product deferred revenue related to contract acceptance terms largely offset by increased service deferred revenue related to growth in customer service and support contracts a 602 million increase in accounts receivable due to timing of shipments and an 81 million increase in other assets resulting from increased spares inventory to support our customer base these cash outflows were partially offset by cash inflows of 543 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets from a decrease in deferred cost of inventory due to the recognition of product deferred revenue 235 million from an increase in income taxes payable 209 million decrease in inventories due to timing of product shipments and receipts and 164 million from increased accrued liabilities primarily due to an increase in supplier liability reserves for excess and obsolete component inventory 

cash flows from investing activities 

our investing activities consist of our marketable securities investments business combinations investments in privatelyheld companies and capital expenditures 

during the year ended december 31 2020 cash used in investing activities was 6088 million primarily consisting of purchases of availableforsale securities of 27 billion 2274 million for the acquisition of big switch and awake security and purchases of property equipment and intangible assets of 154 million partially offset by proceeds of 15 billion from maturities of marketable securities proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 7730 million and proceeds from the sale of one of our investments in privatelyheld companies of 34 million

equipment of 158 million partially offset by proceeds of 12 billion from maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from the sale of one of our investments in privatelyheld companies of 282 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities consist of proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under employee equity incentive plans offset by repurchases of our common stock 

during the year ended december 31 2020 cash used in financing activities was 3463 million consisting primarily of payments for repurchases of our common stock of 3952 million and taxes paid of 87 million upon vesting of restricted stock units offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee equity incentive plans of 576 million 

during the year ended december 31 2019 cash used in financing activities was 2180 million consisting primarily of payments for repurchases of our common stock of 2661 million and taxes paid of 92 million upon vesting of restricted stock units partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee equity incentive plans of 574 million 

stock repurchase program 

we have periodically repurchased our common stock pursuant to our repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in april 2019 the repurchase program allows for stock repurchases of up to 10 billion over three years and these repurchases are to be funded from operating cash flows the repurchase program which expires in april 2022 does not obligate us to acquire any of our common stock and may be suspended or discontinued by us at any time without prior notice as of december 31 2020 the remaining authorized amount for repurchases under the repurchase program was 3387 million refer to note 8 stockholders equity and stockbased compensation of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2020 we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity our contractual obligations represent material expected or contractually committed future payment obligations we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing balances of cash cash equivalent and marketable securities 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2020 in thousands 



the contractual obligation table above excludes tax liabilities of 467 million related to uncertain tax positions because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement if any of these future payments 

in connection with the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 we recorded a federal income tax payable for transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings that will be payable over an eightyear period the amounts included in the table above represent the remaining federal income tax payable after applying the first years installment payment and early payments of future installments 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap or us gaap and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods we base our estimates assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements which in turn could change the results from those reported we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected the critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are the following 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from sales of our products which incorporate our eos software and accessories such as cables and optics to direct customers and channel partners together with pcs we typically sell products and pcs in a single contract we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services we apply the following fivestep revenue recognition model 

• identification of the contract or contracts with a customer 

• identification of the performance obligations in the contract 

• determination of the transaction price 

• allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 

• recognition of revenue when or as we satisfy the performance obligation 

postcontract customer support 

pcs which includes technical support hardware repair and replacement parts beyond standard warranty bug fixes patches and unspecified upgrades on a whenandifavailable basis is offered under renewable feebased contracts we initially defer pcs revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the pcs contract as there is no discernible pattern of delivery related to these promises we do not provide unspecified upgrades on a set schedule and address customer requests for technical support if and when they arise with the related expenses recognized as incurred pcs contracts generally have a term of one to three years we include billed but unearned pcs revenue in deferred revenue 

contracts with multiple performance obligations 

most of our contracts with customers other than renewals of pcs contain multiple performance obligations with a combination of products and pcs products and pcs generally qualify as distinct performance obligations our hardware includes eos software which together deliver the essential functionality of our products for contracts which contain multiple performance obligations we allocate revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on the standalone selling price “ssp” judgment is 

required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp for products and pcs sold together in a contract to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and pcs 

if we do not have an observable ssp such as when we do not sell a product or service separately then ssp is estimated using judgment and considering all reasonably available information such as market conditions and information about the size andor purchase volume of the customer we generally use a range of amounts to estimate ssp for individual products and services based on multiple factors including but not limited to the sales channel reseller distributor or end customer the geographies in which our products and services are sold and the size of the end customer 

we limit the amount of revenue recognition for contracts containing forms of variable consideration such as future performance obligations customerspecific returns and acceptance or refund obligations we include some or all of an estimate of the related at risk consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recorded under each contract will not occur when the uncertainties surrounding the variable consideration are resolved 

most of our contracts with customers have payment terms of 30 days with some large high volume customers having terms of up to 60 days we have determined that our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component because the company and the customer have specific business reasons other than financing for entering into such contracts specifically both we and our customers seek to ensure the customer has a simplified way of purchasing our products and services 

we account for multiple contracts with a single partner as one arrangement if the contractual terms andor substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are in effect parts of a single contract 

we may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is generally no contractual provision for such returns we estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical return rates applied against currentperiod shipments specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate 

our policy applies to the accounting for individual contracts however we have elected a practical expedient to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts or performance obligations with similar characteristics so long as such application would not differ materially from applying the guidance to the individual contracts or performance obligations within that portfolio consequently we have chosen to apply the portfolio approach when possible which we do not believe will happen frequently additionally we will evaluate a portfolio of data when possible in various situations including accounting for commissions rights of return and transactions with variable consideration 

we report revenue net of sales taxes we include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 

inventory valuation and contract manufacturersupplier liabilities 

inventories primarily consist of finished goods and strategic components primarily integrated circuits inventories are stated at the lower of cost computed using the firstin firstout method and net realizable value manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory we record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value 

our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts we record a liability and a corresponding charge for noncancellable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers or suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes 

we use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures these estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers product development plans and current sales levels if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management which may be caused by factors within andor outside of our control we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturersupplier liabilities 

income taxes 

income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that we recognize for financial reporting and income tax purposes 

we account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements but have not been reflected in our taxable income estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize 

we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

we regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether and to the extent to which additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense 

the us tax rules require us tax on foreign earnings known as global intangible low taxed income “gilti” under us gaap we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either 1 treating taxes due on future us inclusions in taxable income related to gilti as a currentperiod expense when incurred the “period cost method” or 2 factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes the “deferred method” we selected the deferred method of accounting and recorded the associated basis differences anticipated to influence prospective gilti calculations 

loss contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are a party to claims and legal proceedings including matters relating to commercial employee relations business practices and intellectual property in assessing loss contingencies we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss we record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we will record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be 

reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and investments in privatelyheld companies the ongoing covid19 pandemic has increased the volatility of global financial markets which may increase our foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk for further discussion of the potential impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business operating results and financial condition see risk factors included in part i item 1a of this form 10k 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars and therefore our revenue is not directly subject to foreign currency risk however we are indirectly exposed to foreign currency risk a stronger us dollar could make our products and services more expensive in foreign countries and therefore reduce demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect such economic exposure to currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are also influenced by many other factors 

our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located which is primarily in the us and to a lesser extent in europe and asia our results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates on our monetary assets and liabilities would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations to date foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date and do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

interest rate sensitivity 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had cash cash equivalents and availableforsale marketable securities totaling 29 billion and 27 billion respectively cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in money market funds corporate bonds us agency mortgagebacked securities us treasury securities and commercial paper our primary investment objectives are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements in addition our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issuer we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the us a decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income on our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in overall interest rates would not have had a material impact on our interest income 

on the other hand the fair market value of our investments in fixed income securities may be adversely impacted we would incur unrealized losses on fixed income securities if there is an increase in interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase under certain circumstances if we are forced to sell our marketable securities prior to maturity we may incur realized losses in such investments however 

because of the conservative and shortterm nature of the investments in our portfolio a change in interest rates is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

investments in privatelyheld companies 

our nonmarketable equity investments in privatelyheld companies are recorded in “investments” in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the total carrying amount of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 83 million and 42 million during fiscal 2020 we recorded a net gain of 41 million on certain investments compared to a net gain of 54 million during fiscal 2019 see note 5 investments of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for details 

the privatelyheld companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privatelyheld companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

management with the participation of our chief executive officer “ceo” and our chief financial officer “cfo” evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2020 the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2020 our ceo and cfo concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by rule 13a15d and 15d15d of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended that occurred during the year ended december 31 2020 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of internal controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act our internal control 

over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 based on the framework set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control  integrated framework 2013 framework based on that assessment management concluded that as of december 31 2020 its internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 has been audited by ernst  young llp the independent registered public accounting firm that audits our consolidated financial statements as stated in their report included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020

 item 1 business 

arista networks pioneered softwaredriven cognitive cloud networking for largescale datacenter and campus environments our cloud networking solutions consist of our extensible operating system eos a set of network applications and our ethernet switching and routing platforms our cloud networking solutions deliver industryleading performance scalability availability programmability automation and visibility at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was purposebuilt to be fully programmable highly modular and reliable the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services since we began shipping our products we have grown rapidly and according to market research we have achieved the second largest market share in data center ethernet switch ports we have been profitable and cash flow positive for each year since 2010 

eos supports leading cloud and virtualization solutions including vmware nsx microsoft system center openstack and other cloud management frameworks we have worked with industry leaders to define new open protocols for the virtualized data center we coauthored the vxlan protocol specification with vmware and were the first to demonstrate vxlan integration and have now expanded vxlan routing and integration 

we use standard linux as our underlying operating system providing customers with access to all linux operating system facilities this allows customers to extend our eos software with offtheshelf linux applications and a growing number of open source management tools 

eos has a highly modular architecture which allows us to prevent network outages in deployments of our cloud networking solutions this architecture also allows us to rapidly develop new features and protocols without compromising the quality of the existing code base because all of our platform products are powered by the same binary image of eos we are able to deliver these new innovations to our entire installed base with minimal disruption 

in 2015 we introduced cloudvision a networkwide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation delivering a turnkey solution for cloud networking we believe cloudvision’s abstraction of the physical network to this broader networkwide perspective allows for a more efficient approach for several operational usecases related to automation visibility management security and 3rd party controller integration 

in 2018 we announced a new network architecture designed to redefine the campus network into a cognitive singletier spline tm driven by a single image operating system that extends across the campus and the data center leveraging eos® and cloudvision® our cognitive cloud networking approach brings operational consistency and modern cloud principles to the enterprise campus in the face of a proliferation of internet of things iot related users behaviors and complexities as part of the enterprise campus solution we acquired mojo networks inc “mojo” inventor of cognitive wifi tm and a leader in cloudmanaged wireless networking we also acquired metamako holding pty ltd “metamako” a leader in lowlatency fpgaenabled network solutions 

in 2019 we completed the introduction of ten new 400g platforms in the leafspine high network radix category we offer two new fixed 32 port 400g switches and a 128 port 100g32 port 400g modular switch for the universal leaf and spine category of switching we introduced our r3 series 100g and 400g products supporting up to 25m routes on our 7280r3 series fixed and 7500r3 series modular platforms we also introduced a new modular family called the 7800r3 a high density 100g and 400g platform supporting up to 460 tbps of system throughput in addition we launched the 720xp series of fixed power over ethernet poe leaf switches with mgig and 60w poe enabling us to offer a complete end to end solution for cognitive campus ethernet as well as the introduction of our new wifi6 wireless aps 

we sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations 

government agencies media and entertainment companies and others our customers include six of the largest cloud services providers based on annual revenue 

industry background 

cloud computing is fundamentally changing the way it infrastructure is built and how applications are delivered in cloud computing applications are distributed across thousands of servers these servers are connected with highspeed network switches that together form a pool of resources that allows applications to be rapidly deployed and costeffectively updated cloud computing enables ubiquitous and ondemand network access to these applications from internetconnected devices including personal computers tablets and smartphones 

nearly all consumer applications today are delivered as cloud services enterprise applications are rapidly moving to the cloud as well since cloud services are easier and more cost effective to deploy scale and operate than traditional applications internet leaders like amazon facebook google and microsoft pioneered the development of largescale cloud data centers in order to meet the growing demands of their users including business customers enterprises and service providers around the world are adopting cloud computing technologies in order to achieve similar performance improvements and cost reductions 

the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can be orders of magnitude higher than typical legacy data center networks therefore the networks in such cloud environments must be architected and built in a new way we refer to these nextgeneration data center networks as cloud networks cloud networks must deliver high capacity high availability and predictable performance and must be programmable to allow integration with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services 

limitations of traditional data center networks 

in our view cloud networks and legacy networks are fundamentally different in a traditional data center specific applications are installed on a small number of servers and most network traffic is servertoclient or “northsouth” traffic which results in perhaps a few terabitssecond of aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud most network traffic is servertoserver or “eastwest” traffic the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can exceed 1 petabitsecond orders of magnitude higher than that of typical legacy data center networks 

the much larger scale of cloud networks requires much higher network availability since network outages in the cloud are very expensive in terms of customer impact traditional network switches have evolved and the features and capabilities of their operating system have expanded over many years without addressing the structural deficiencies of their underlying software architectures making it difficult to achieve high network switch reliability 

some networking vendors have built products that use proprietary protocols to address the scaling needs of nextgeneration data centers however proprietary protocols are generally not acceptable to internet companies or cloud service providers because they create vendor lockin 

legacy networks are not programmable and as a result are extremely difficult to integrate with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services this lack of integration forces customers to continue to rely on time consuming errorprone manual processes that may be costprohibitive 

limitations of traditional enterprise campus networks 

traditional enterprise campus networks suffer from complex bottlenecks brought on by the myriad of platforms operating systems proprietary features and network management tools coupled with the explosive growth of iot and endpoints as well as the requirement for workloads users and devices to be connected anywhere the operational costs of managing these complexities become prohibitive 

our cloud networking solutions 

we are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration enterprise data centers and campuses our cloud networking platform was purposebuilt to address the functional and performance requirements for 

cloud networks we deliver our solutions via our industryleading 125510254050100400 gigabit ethernet switches and routers optimized for nextgeneration data center networks 

our cloud networking solutions consist of eos a set of networking applications and our gigabit ethernet platforms at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was architected to be fully programmable and highly modular 

the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications and application programming interfaces apis that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has further allowed us to integrate rapidly with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services 

the key benefits of our cloud networking solutions are as follows 

capacity performance and scalability 

our cloud networking platform enables data center networks to scale to hundreds of thousands of physical servers and millions of virtual machines with the least number of switching tiers we achieve this by leveraging standard protocols to meet the scale requirements of cloud computing we have used activeactive layer 2 and layer 3 network topologies to enable customers to build extremely large and resilient networks 

high availability 

our highly modular eos software architecture was designed to be faultisolating and selfhealing in order to deliver higher stability compared to legacy network operating systems in addition our customers can nondisruptively upgrade our switches running in the network using our smart system upgrade or ssu application 

open and programmable 

our eos software was purposebuilt to offer programmable interfaces throughout all levels of our software this has allowed us to integrate our cloud networking platform with a wide range of leading thirdparty applications for example we support vmware nsx openconfigyang and microsoft system center for orchestration and fast provisioning enabling true workload mobility and automatic provisioning of physical switches we enable customers through apis to write their own scripts to customize and optimize their networks 

workflow automation 

our eos software enables enterprises to provision networking resources in minutes with no manual intervention through our zero touch provisioning we also natively support ansible cfengine chef puppet virtual network orchestration applications and thirdparty management tools cloudvision a networkwide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation delivers a turnkey solution for cloud networking cloudvision extends the same eos architectural approach across the network for state topology monitoring and visibility this enables enterprises to move to cloudclass automation without needing significant internal development finally eos embraces the devops model which is a software development method that combines development and operations to provision and monitor servers storage and network resources in a unified fashion 

network visibility 

our eos software provides a set of tools and applications that proactively monitor detect and notify network managers when network issues arise delivering realtime data to thirdparty management applications including corvil extrahop riverbed and splunk to provide detailed application visibility our telemetry applications include vm tracer which provides visibility down to the virtual machine level path tracer which detects errors in provisioned network paths mapreduce tracer which monitors and optimizes the performance of hadoop workloads flow tracker which can visualize all connected endpoints including iphones ipads and iot devices and health tracer which monitors infrastructure resiliency our network visibility applications provide realtime insight into the status of the network they include lanz which monitors latency and danz 2017 a set of features previously only available in addon network visibility devices which provides advanced traffic monitoring with flow analysis and timestamps plus the ability to perform tap aggregation for reporting and analysis 

security 

macrosegmentation services mss™ is one of the services enabled via cloudvision since cloudvision maintains a networkwide database of all state within the network as well as direct integration with hypervisor resources like vmware vsphere and nsx it is aware of every workload that is within the network and it learns in real time about new devices or workloads that are added or removed from the network or moved across ports or servers macrosegmentation extends the concept of finegrained interhypervisor security to cloud networks by enabling dynamic security and services for physical to virtual workloads macrosegmentation security is a complement to finegrained security delivered via microsegmentation that is already implemented in the virtual switch of the physical host on which a vm is running 

lower total cost of ownership 

our cloud networking platform offers architectural and system advantages that provide our customers with costeffective and highly available cloud networking solutions our programmable scalable leafspine architectures combined with industryleading applications significantly reduce networking costs when compared to legacy network designs enabling faster time to service and improved availability our automation tools reduce the operational costs of provisioning managing and monitoring a data center network and speed up service delivery our visibility tools provide high levels of visibility into complex network environments without the need for additional data collection equipment as a result fewer network engineers are needed to operate large networks 

enterprise campus networks 

arista cloudvision built on the cognitive management plane cmp engine is a platform for turnkey orchestration provisioning and telemetry born initially in the data center era cloudvision now extends the same common operational model to the campus providing unified wired and wireless management as well as onpremise and cloud hosted data center management 

today’s wired and wireless campus networks must cope with everincreasing endpoint devices necessitating the understanding of endpoint behavior cloudvision’s latest feature device analyzer provides inventory and deep flow analysis of all connected devices campus administrators can access device type connectivity method location and communication patterns this visibility enables an administrator to identify unauthorized traffic and compromised endpoints since cloudvision spans the data center and the campus customers can leverage a single platform for endtoend troubleshooting 

our market opportunity 

we compete primarily in the data center switching market for 10 gigabit ethernet and above excluding blade switches we more recently began to compete in the enterprise campus market for 1 gigabit ethernet switching and above and in the cloudmanaged wireless networking market 

we believe that cloud computing represents a fundamental shift from traditional legacy network architectures as organizations of all sizes have moved workloads to the cloud spending on cloud and nextgeneration data centers has increased rapidly while traditional legacy it spending has grown more slowly 

our customers 

as of december 31 2019 we had delivered our cloud networking solutions to over 6000 end customers worldwide in approximately 94 countries our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others for the year ended december 31 2019 purchases by microsoft and facebook each accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue in addition for each of the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 microsoft accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue purchases by both of these customers are primarily fulfilled through our channel partners 

our competitive strengths 

we believe the following strengths will allow us to maintain and extend our technology leadership position in cloud networking and nextgeneration data center ethernet products 

• purposebuilt cloud networking platform we have developed a highly scalable cloud networking platform that uses software to address the needs of largescale internet companies cloud service providers financial services organizations government agencies and media and entertainment companies including virtualization big data and lowlatency applications as a result our cloud networking platform does not have the inherent limitations of legacy network architectures

• significant technology lead we believe that our networking technology represents a fundamental advance in networking software our eos software is statedriven and the result of more than 1000 manyears of research and development investment over a tenyear period with 10 million lines of code as a key cloud networking software stack 

our products and technology 

we offer one of the broadest product lines of datacenter and campus 125510254050100400 gigabit ethernet switches and routers in the industry comprising our 720xp 70107020r series 7050x series 7060x series 7130 series 7160 series 7150 series 7170 series 7250x series 7280r series universal leaf products 7300x series spline products and our 7500r7800r series universal spine products 

we deliver routing and switching platforms with industryleading capacity low latency port density and power efficiency we have also innovated in areas such as deep packet buffers embedded optics and reversible cooling an overview of our switchingrouting portfolio is shown in the figure below 

our extensible operating system 

the core of our cloud networking platform is our eos which runs on top of standard linux and offers programmability at all layers of the stack all of our ethernet platforms run our eos software 

eos is based on a new and innovative architecture that is highly modular and consists of more than 100 separate processes that we call agents each one handling specific protocol processing device driver or system management functions each agent runs in user space as a separate linux process and is completely protected and isolated from all other agents 

we are constantly investing in our core infrastructure to provide the capabilities required for building modern cloud networks and enhancing scalability new requirements for use in cloud and service provider networks and hybrid cloud deployments in enterprises require ongoing upgrades and extensions to our state oriented architecture 

eos attributes 

the modular and programmable architecture of eos enables us to offer a set of attributes capabilities and features that are essential for cloud networking and nextgeneration data centers 

high availability 

eos is selfhealing in the sense that individual processes can be restarted without impacting application traffic this architectural design principle supports selfhealing resiliency in our software easier software maintenance and module independence higher software quality overall and faster timetomarket for new features that customers require 

programmable at all layers 

eos is programmable at all layers from the linux kernel to switch configuration provisioning automation and detailed monitoring of the network public cloud providers have leveraged tools such as the eos software development kit “sdk” and eapi to implement fully customized infrastructure automation solutions 

workflow visibility 

through eos we have developed a wide range of applications available to our customers for purchase as additional licenses that enable enhanced network monitoring and visibility without requiring additional external monitoring devices this includes i dataanalyzer danz which provides access to raw network data for analysis by security troubleshooting and performance management tools ii latencyloss analyzer lanz which provides access to internal network performance loads and packet loss and latency occurring at the microsecond level iii network telemetry which provides network state information including correlations with dynamic state of the systems operating on the network such as hypervisors distributed job controls and iv network tracers which provide active integration and diagnostics for various workload conditions dependent upon network performance 

network automation 

eos supports puppet chef and ansible which enables automatic network configuration in the same manner as servers and storage in addition eos provides tools that greatly reduce network operational costs another major component of network automation is cloud vision 

cloudvision 

cloudvision’s abstraction of the physical network to a broader networkwide perspective allows for a more efficient approach for several operational usecases including the following highlights 

• centralized representation of distributed network state allowing for a single point of integration and networkwide visibility and analytics 

• controller agnostic support for physical and virtual workload orchestration through open apis such as ovsdb json and openstack plugins 

• turnkey automation for zero touch provisioning configuration management and networkwide upgrades and rollback 

• compliance dashboard for security audit and patch management 

• realtime streaming for telemetry and network analytics a modern approach to replace legacy polling per device 

• provides visibility and troubleshooting for underlay and overlay networks and 

• enables macrosegmentation services which provides a dynamic and scalable network service to logically insert security devices into the path of traffic regardless of whether the security device or workload is physical or virtual and with complete flexibility on placement of security devices and workloads 

leafspine network designs 

our customers typically deploy leafspine network topologies consisting of leaf switches or topofrack switches located in the server rack connected with uplinks to multiple loadsharing spine switches and routers that provide the backbone our leafspine network designs scale up to more than 300000 physical servers and millions of virtual machines using equal cost multiple path or ecmp to load balance layer 3 network traffic across multiple spine switches and routers with multichassis link aggregation or mlag we can build an activeactive layer 2 network that can connect more than 25000 physical servers our leafspine network designs have been widely deployed and provide predictable network bandwidth and latency a key advantage of predictable network performance is that it eliminates the need to optimize the network for specific applications which means a single network design works equally well for all applications 

enterprise resources commonly span multiple data centers or performance optimized datacenters “pods” within a data center including the public cloud the drive to deliver resources quickly affordably and reliably also drives the need for a flexible costeffective scaleout design at the data center core which we refer to as the “spine of spines” or universal spine the universal spine is nonblocking supports large scale ecmp 

ip routing and routing convergence the universal spine enables architects to build the network around the spine and collapse legacy networking layers into the universal spine 

examples of our leafspine and universal leafspine architectures are illustrated below

cognitive cloud networking for the campus 

our cognitive cloud networking for the campus is based on three principles 

universal cloud network   offered as an alternative to brittle proprietary solutions from legacy vendors our universal cloud network is an open standardsbased design focusing on softwaredriven control principles our collapsed spline™ approach consolidates traditional campus core and aggregation layers into a simple single tier with high availability 

cognitive management plane   there is a dire void in management plane consistency and a need for datadriven analytics in the campus as in the data center we believe that a common model can be applied across both saving customers operational costs the cmp based on arista cloudvision is a datadriven repository for the automated actions across network analytics 

securing the campus   securing the campus spline requires a holistic approach to network segmentation device compliance and auditing as well as service integration with our security partners we deliver these capabilities through eos and cloudvision 

examples of our cognitive cloud networking architectures are illustrated below 

customer support and services 

we have designed our customer support offerings to provide our customers with high levels of support our global team of support engineers engages directly with client it teams and is available at all times over email by phone or through our website 

we offer multiple service options that allow our customers to select the product replacement service level that best meets their needs we stock spare parts in over 125 locations around the world through our thirdparty logistics suppliers all of our service options include unlimited access to bugfixes new featurereleases online case management and our community forums 

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our products through our direct sales force and in partnership with our channel partners including distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators and oem partners we also sell in conjunction with various technology partners to facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity we have created a partner program the arista partner program to engage partners who provide valueadded services and extend our reach into the marketplace authorized training partners perform technical training of our channel partners and end customers our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us 

our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for presales technical support and solutions engineering for our end customers systems integrators original equipment manufacturers or oems and channel partners a pool of shared channel sales and marketing representatives also supports these teams each sales team is responsible for a geographical territory has responsibility for a number of major direct endcustomer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market we have field sales teams operating in approximately 94 countries 

our marketing activities consist primarily of technology conferences web marketing trade shows product demonstrations seminars and events public relations analyst relations demand generation and direct marketing to build our brand increase endcustomer awareness communicate our product advantages and generate qualified leads for our field sales force and channel partners 

research and development 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and features that address the needs of our end customers our inhouse engineering personnel are responsible for the development quality documentation support and release of our products we plan to continue to invest in resources to conduct our research and development efforts 

manufacturing 

we subcontract the manufacturing of all of our products to various contract manufacturers our primary manufacturing partners are jabil circuit and sanmina corporation this approach allows us to reduce our costs manufacturing overhead and inventory position and allows us to adjust more quickly to changing endcustomer demand we require all of our manufacturing locations to be iso9001 certified we have four direct fulfillment facilities worldwide to hold finished good inventory perform product transformations and install our eos software to ship to customers and partners 

our contract manufacturing partners procure the majority of the components needed to build our products and assemble our products according to our design specifications this allows us to leverage the purchasing power of our contract manufacturing partners we retain complete control over the bill of material test procedures and quality assurance programs our personnel work closely with our partners and review on an ongoing basis forecasts inventory levels processes capacity yields and overall quality our contract manufacturing partners procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts these forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analyses from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions 

our products rely on key components including merchant silicon integrated circuit components and power supplies purchased from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers we also expect to see increased consolidation among our component suppliers generally neither our contract manufacturers nor we have a written agreement with these component providers to guarantee the supply of the key components used in our products nor do we have exclusive rights to such key components and our suppliers could suffer shortages delay shipments prioritize shipments to other vendors increase prices or cease manufacturing such products or selling them to us at any time supply of components may also be adversely affected by geopolitical conditions such as international trade wars like the us trade war with china and the impact of public health epidemics like the coronavirus currently affecting china 

our product development efforts also depend upon continued collaboration with our key suppliers including our merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors it is critical that we work in tandem with our key merchant silicon vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features this enables us to focus our research and development resources on software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions 

once the completed products are manufactured and tested our contract manufacturing partners ship them to various theatre direct fulfillment facilities in the united states the netherlands and singapore for final configuration quality control inspection and shipment to our distribution partners and end customers after the products are shipped to our end customers our products are installed by the end customers or by thirdparty service providers such as system integrators or value added resellers on their behalf 

backlog 

we do not have any longterm purchase commitments from customers customers generally order products on an asneeded basis with short lead and delivery times on a perpurchaseorder basis we maintain sufficient finished goods inventory to ensure that products can generally be shipped shortly after receipt of an order a significant portion of our customer shipments in any fiscal year relate to orders received and shipped in that fiscal year our customers utilize purchase orders containing nonbinding purchase commitments and we allow customers to cancel change or reschedule orders without penalty at any time prior to shipment and as a result we do not 

believe backlog is firm due to the foregoing factors backlog is not a meaningful indicator in any given period of our ability to achieve any particular level of overall revenue or financial performance 

competition 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology changing endcustomer needs evolving industry standards frequent introductions of new products and services and industry consolidation we expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for cloud networking expands and existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products 

the data center and campus networking markets have been historically dominated by cisco with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including extreme networks dellemc hewlett packard enterprise juniper networks and mist systems most of our competitors and some strategic alliance partners have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example broadcom acquired brocade communications systems extreme networks purchased certain data center networking assets from broadcombrocade and avaya dell acquired emc and hewlett packard enterprise acquired aruba networks 

we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants current technology partners and end customers who may acquire or develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products to market and sell to customers some of these competitors are developing networking products based on offtheshelf or commoditized hardware technology or “white box” hardware particularly where an end customer’s network strategy seeks to emphasize deployment of such product offerings or adopt a disaggregated approach to the procurement of hardware and software end customers may also increase their adoption of networking solutions based upon open source network operating systems that may be provided for free and used either on “white box” or proprietary hardware the entrance of new competitors into our markets or the increased adoption of these new technology solutions or consumption models may cause downward pricing pressures result in lost sales or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our relationships with our strategic alliance partners or suppliers may also shift as industry dynamics changes if strategic alliance partners acquire or develop competitive products or services our relationship with those partners may be adversely impacted which could lead to more variability to our results of operations and impact the pricing of our solutions 

the principal competitive factors applicable to our products include 

• breadth of product offerings and features 

• reliability and product quality 

• ease of use 

• pricing 

• total cost of ownership including automation monitoring and integration costs 

• performance and scale 

• programmability and extensibility 

• interoperability with other products 

• ability to be bundled with other vendor offerings and 

• quality of service support and fulfillment 

we believe our products compete favorably with respect to these factors our eos software offers high reliability integrates with existing network protocols and is open and programmable we believe the combination of eos a set of network applications and our 125510254050100400 gigabit ethernet platforms make our 

offering highly competitive for both cloud and enterprise data centers however many of our competitors have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger sales and marketing budgets and resources broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and end customers greater access to larger endcustomer bases greater endcustomer support resources greater manufacturing resources the ability to leverage their sales efforts across a broader portfolio of products the ability to leverage purchasing power when purchasing subcomponents the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services the ability to develop their own silicon chips the ability to set more aggressive pricing policies lower labor and development costs greater resources to make acquisitions larger intellectual property portfolios and substantially greater financial technical research and development or other resources 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our core technology and intellectual property we rely on patent trademark and copyright laws trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees end customers resellers systems integrators and others to protect our intellectual property rights we file us and foreign patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 

we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of valuable breadth or applicability in addition any patents that may be issued may be contested circumvented found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them we also license software from third parties for integration into our products including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms we also own a number of trademarks in the us and other jurisdictions including arista eos cloudvision cloudstream cvp cvx health tracer mapreduce tracer path tracer mxp mss rail score spline superspine ssu flexroute netrollback netdb osfp algomatch macrosegmentation and macrosegmentation service 

we control access to and use of our software technology and other proprietary information through internal and external controls including contractual protections with employees contractors end customers and partners our software is protected by us and international copyright patent and trade secret laws despite our efforts to protect our software technology and other proprietary information unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software technology and other proprietary information in addition we intend to expand our international operations and effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights if we become more successful we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights it may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights in particular large and established companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation from time to time third parties including certain of these large companies and nonpracticing entities may assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our end customers whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against such claims please see “legal proceedings” included in part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of this litigation 

successful claims of infringement by a third party if any could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services require us to expend time and money to develop noninfringing solutions or force us to pay substantial damages royalties or other fees we cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe or that we will not in the future infringe upon any thirdparty patents or other proprietary rights

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k which could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the risks described below are not the only risks facing us risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

risks related to our business and our industry 

the cloud networking market is rapidly evolving if this market does not evolve as we anticipate or our target end customers do not adopt our cloud networking solutions we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the growth and evolution of the cloud networking market the market demand for cloud networking solutions has increased in recent years as end customers have deployed larger more sophisticated networks and have increased the use of virtualization and cloud computing the continued growth of this market will be dependent upon many factors including but not limited to the adoption of and demand for our end customers’ products and services the expansion evolution and build out of our end customers’ networks the capacity utilization of existing network infrastructures changes in the technological requirements for the products and services to be deployed in these networks the amount and mix of capital spending by our end customers the development of network switches and cloud service solutions by our large end customers for internal use the financial performance and prospects of our end customers the availability of capital resources to our end customers changes in government regulation that could impact cloud networking business models including those regulations related to cybersecurity privacy data protection and net neutrality our ability to provide cloud networking solutions that address the needs of end customers more effectively and economically than those of other competitors or existing technologies and general economic conditions 

if the cloud networking solutions market does not develop in the way we anticipate or otherwise experiences a slowdown if our solutions do not offer benefits compared to competing networking products or if end customers do not recognize the benefits that our solutions provide then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

we expect large purchases by a limited number of end customers to continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue and any loss delay decline or other change in expected purchases could result in material quartertoquarter fluctuations of our revenue or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue particularly in the cloud networking market many of these end customers make large purchases to complete or upgrade specific data center installations and are typically made on a purchaseorder basis rather than pursuant to longterm contracts for example revenue from sales to microsoft through our channel partner world wide technology inc accounted for 23  27 and 16 of our revenue for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively in addition revenue from sales to facebook through our channel partners accounted for 17 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 our sales to these end users in fiscal 2019 benefited from certain factors that are not expected to be repeated in fiscal 2020 or future years as a result the percentage of our revenue from microsoft and facebook in fiscal 2020 is expected to decline which will likely impact our revenue growth 

as a consequence of the concentrated nature of our customer base and their purchasing behavior our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate changes in the business requirements or focus vendor selection project prioritization manner in which spending allocations are assigned among multiple vendors based upon specific network roles or projects financial prospects lack of growth of our customers capital resources and expenditures or purchasing behavior and deceleration in spending of our key end customers could significantly decrease our sales to such end customers or could lead to delays reductions or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services moreover because our sales will be based primarily on purchase orders our customers may cancel delay reduce or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no notice to us this limited visibility regarding our end customers’ product needs the timing and quantity of which could vary significantly requires us to rely on estimated demand forecasts to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages which could lead to delays in fulfilling current and future purchase orders that can impede production by our customers and harm our customer relationships and in the event of a cancellation or reduction of an order we may not have enough time to reduce operating expenses to mitigate the effect of the lost revenue on our business which could materially affect our operating results 

we may be unable to sustain or increase our revenue from our large end customers grow revenues with new or other existing end customers at the rate we anticipate or at all or offset the discontinuation of concentrated purchases by our larger end customers with purchases by new or existing end customers these customers can drive the growth in revenue for particular products and services based on factors such as trends in the networking market business mergers and acquisitions trends in economic conditions and the overall fast growth of a customer’s underlying business these customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors reassign spending allocations demand pricing concessions for our services require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs or reduce their spending levels if these factors drove some of our large customers to cancel all or a portion of their business relationships with us the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and longterm financial forecasts may be materially impacted we expect that such concentrated purchases will continue to contribute materially to our revenue for the foreseeable future and that our results of operations may fluctuate materially as a result of such larger end customers’ buying patterns in addition we may see consolidation of our customer base such as among internet companies and cloud service providers which could result in loss of end customers the loss of such end customers or a significant delay or reduction in their purchases including reductions or delays due to customer departures from recent buying patterns or an unfavorable change in competitive conditions could materially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects for example we have experienced reduced and volatile demand from certain of our large end customers during the year ended december 31 2019 and expect this could continue in future periods 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology and network infrastructure spending may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology network connectivity and access to data and applications weak domestic or global economic conditions fear or anticipation of such conditions 

international trade disputes or a reduction in information technology and network infrastructure spending even if economic conditions improve could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our distributors reduced unit sales and lower or no growth for example the global macroeconomic environment could be negatively affected by among other things instability in global economic markets resulting from increased us trade tariffs and trade disputes between the us and other countries instability in the global credit markets the impact and uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy rising interest rates and increased inflation including the instability in the geopolitical environment as a result of the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union economic challenges in china ongoing political demonstrations in hong kong foreign governmental debt concerns and the impact of public health epidemics like the coronavirus affecting china such challenges have caused and are likely to continue to cause uncertainty and instability in local economies and in global financial markets particularly if any future sovereign debt defaults or significant bank failures or defaults occur market uncertainty and instability in europe or asia could intensify or spread further particularly if ongoing stabilization efforts prove insufficient continuing or worsening economic instability could adversely affect spending for it network infrastructure systems and tools continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may also affect the overall demand for our products although we do not believe that our business financial condition results of operations and prospects have been significantly adversely affected by economic and political uncertainty in europe asia or other countries to date deterioration of such conditions may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in the future a prolonged period of economic uncertainty or a downturn may also significantly affect financing markets the availability of capital and the terms and conditions of financing arrangements including the overall cost of financing as well as the financial health or creditworthiness of our end customers circumstances may arise in which we need or desire to raise additional capital and such capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

our business and operations have experienced rapid growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected 

we have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last several years which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure our employee headcount and number of end customers have increased and we expect both to continue to grow over the next year for example between december 31 2015 and december 31 2019 our headcount grew from approximately 1200 employees to approximately 2300 employees and our cumulative number of end customers grew from approximately 3700 to over 6000 as we have grown we have had to manage an increasingly large and more complex array of internal systems and processes to scale with all aspects of our business including our hardware and software development contract manufacturing purchasing logistics fulfillment and maintenance and support our success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and continue to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems we may not be able to successfully implement these or other improvements to our systems and processes in an efficient or timely manner and we may discover deficiencies in their capabilities or effectiveness we may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems and processes or in connection with thirdparty technology in addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate effectively and in the intended manner may result in disruption of our current operations and endcustomer relationships our inability to manage the growth of our business and our inability to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings and prevent certain losses 

we pursue new product and service offerings and technology initiatives from time to time and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted 

as part of the evolution of our business we have made substantial investments to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts to expand our product offerings and maintain revenue growth of the company if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products and services in a timely and costeffective manner or if we fail to introduce products and services that meet market demand we may lose our competitive position our products may become obsolete and our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

additionally from time to time we invest in expansion into adjacent markets including the campus switching and wifi networking markets although we believe these solutions are complementary to our current offerings we have less experience and a more limited operating history in these markets and our efforts in this area may not be successful expanding our services in existing and new markets and increasing the depth and breadth of our presence imposes significant burdens on our marketing compliance and other administrative and managerial resources our plan to expand and deepen our market share in our existing markets and possibly expand into additional markets is subject to a variety of risks and challenges our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors including the following 

 additionally future market share gains may take longer than planned and cause us to incur significant costs difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

we must continue to enhance our existing products and develop new technologies and products that address emerging technological trends evolving industry standards and changing endcustomer needs the process of enhancing our existing products and developing new technology is complex and uncertain and new offerings requires significant upfront investment that may not result in material design improvements to existing products or result in marketable new products or costs savings or revenue for an extended period of time if at all 

in addition new technologies could render our existing products obsolete or less attractive to end customers and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if such technologies are widely adopted for example end customers may prefer to address their network switch requirements by licensing software operating systems separately and placing them on industrystandard 

servers or develop their own networking products rather than purchasing integrated hardware products as has occurred in the server industry additionally end customers may require product upgrades including higher ethernet speeds and additional functionality to address the increasing demands of the cloud computing environments 

in the past several years we have announced a number of new products and enhancements to our products and services for example we recently introduced our 7800r family of products for demanding 400g cloud networks the success of our new products depends on several factors including but not limited to appropriate new product definition the development of product features that sufficiently meet enduser requirements component costs availability of 400g optical components timely completion and introduction of these products prompt solution of any defects or bugs in these products our ability to support these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 

our product releases introduced new software products that include the capability for disaggregation of our software operating systems from our hardware the success of our strategy to expand our software business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the additional development efforts and costs to create these new products or make them compatible with other technologies the potential for our strategy to negatively impact revenues and gross margins and additional costs associated with regulatory compliance 

we may not be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology or endcustomer requirements on a timely basis or at all if we fail to keep up with technology changes or to convince our end customers and potential end customers of the value of our solutions even in light of new technologies we may lose customers decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and services and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

to remain competitive we must successfully manage product introductions and transitions 

our ability to continue to compete effectively in a rapidly evolving market requires that we successfully release new products that meet the increasingly sophisticated networking requirements of our end customers for example we introduced our 7800r family of products for demanding 400g cloud networks and the next generation of the arista 7500r 7280r series however the ramp in production of our 400g products has been delayed the success of new product introductions will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance of our new products our ability to penetrate new markets our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the timely development and availability of new merchant silicon chips from our suppliers the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction for example our new product releases will require strong execution from our third party merchant silicon chip suppliers to develop and release new merchant silicon chips that satisfy endcustomer requirements to meet expected release schedules and to provide sufficient quantities of these components in addition we introduced arista cognitive cloud networking for the campus as well as mojo cognitive wifi and metamako low latency switches if we are unable to successfully manage our product introductions or transitions or if we fail to penetrate new markets as a result of any of these or other factors our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

our revenue and our revenue growth rate may decline 

our revenue growth rate in previous periods may not be indicative of our future performance we have experienced annual revenue growth rates of 121 307 and 458 in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively in the future we expect our revenue and our revenue growth rates to decline as we have become more penetrated with our existing customer base and product markets and as we look to enter and expand into new target markets other factors may also contribute to declines in our growth rates including changes in demand for our products and services particularly from our large end customers changes in capital spending by our large end customers increased competition our ability to successfully manage our expansion or continue to capitalize on growth opportunities the maturation of our business and general economic international trade conditions and our ability to be successful in adjacent markets such as the campus switching and wifi networking markets for example we have experienced volatility in demand from certain of these large end customers during 2019 resulting in slower overall revenue growth overall demand from these larger customers may decline in future periods which would 

impact our future revenue growth you should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected and our stock price could be volatile 

our results of operations are likely to vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors or our previously issued financial guidance or if any forwardlooking financial guidance does not meet the expectation of analysts or investors the market price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our results of operations have historically varied from period to period and we expect that this trend will continue as a result you should not rely upon our past financial results for any period as indicators of future performance our results of operations in any given period can be influenced by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict including 



 any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of several of the factors described above may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other results of operations and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in the past we have failed to meet investor financial expectations and the market price of our common stock declined this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our revenue gross margins results of operations or other expectations contained in any forward looking financial guidance we have issued or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for a particular period if we fail to meet or exceed such guidance or expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our common stock could decline substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits 

if we are unable to attract new large end customers or to sell additional products and services to our existing end customers our revenue growth will be adversely affected and our revenue could decrease 

to increase our revenue we must add new end customers and large end customers and sell additional products and services to existing end customers for example one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our solutions thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers we also believe the opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing infrastructure and expected future spend another one of our sales strategies is focused on increasing penetration in the enterprise and campus markets however sales strategies focused on expansion to adjacent markets can require more time and effort since enterprise and campus end customers typically start with small purchases and there is often a long testing period for this reason in order to grow our revenue it is important for us to attract new large end customers some factors that may limit our ability to attract new large end customers include but are not limited to saturation with certain of the large cloud networking customers competition decreased capital spending of such customers a limited number of such customers and a decline in growth of such customers if we fail to attract new large end customers including enterprise and campus end customers or fail to reduce the sales cycle and sell additional products to our existing end customers our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

some of our large end customers require more favorable terms and conditions from their vendors and may request price concessions as we seek to sell more products to these end customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenue 

our large end customers have significant purchasing power and as a result may receive more favorable terms and conditions than we typically provide to other end customers including lower prices bundled upgrades extended warranties acceptance terms indemnification terms and extended return policies and other contractual 

rights as we seek to sell more products to these large end customers an increased mix of our shipments may be subject to such terms and conditions which may reduce our margins or affect the timing of our revenue recognition and thus may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we face intense competition especially from larger wellestablished companies and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

the markets in which we compete including the markets for data center and campus networking are intensely competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants this competition could result in increased pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and our failure to increase or the loss of market share any of which would likely seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the data center and campus networking markets have been historically dominated by cisco with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including extreme networks dellemc hewlett packard enterprise and juniper networks most of our competitors and some strategic alliance partners have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example broadcom acquired brocade communications systems extreme networks purchased certain data center networking assets from broadcombrocade and avaya dell acquired emc and hewlett packard enterprise acquired aruba networks 

we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants including current technology partners suppliers and end customers or other cloud service providers who may acquire or develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products to market and sell to customers some of these competitors are developing networking products based on offtheshelf or commoditized hardware technology or “white box” hardware particularly where an end customer’s network strategy seeks to emphasize deployment of such product offerings or adopt a disaggregated approach to the procurement of hardware and software end customers may also increase their adoption of networking solutions based upon open source network operating systems that may be provided for free and used either on “white box” or proprietary hardware the entrance of new competitors into our markets or the increased adoption of these new technology solutions or consumption models may cause downward pricing pressures result in lost sales or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business prospects financial condition and operating results 

our relationships with our strategic alliance partners or suppliers may also shift as industry dynamics changes if strategic alliance partners acquire or develop competitive products or services our relationship with those partners may be adversely impacted which could lead to more variability to our results of operations and impact the pricing of our solutions 

many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 



 our competitors also may be able to provide end customers with capabilities or benefits different from or greater than those we can provide in areas such as technical qualifications or geographic presence or may be able to provide end customers a broader range of products services and prices in addition large competitors may have more extensive relationships with and within existing and potential end customers that provide them with an advantage in competing for business with those end customers for example certain large competitors encourage end customers of their other products and services to adopt their data networking solutions through discounted bundled product packages our ability to compete will depend upon our ability to provide a better solution than our competitors at a more competitive price we may be required to make substantial additional investments in research development marketing and sales in order to respond to competition and we cannot assure you that these investments will achieve any returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

we also expect increased competition if our market continues to expand as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we may experience pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets as well as those with greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or other factors current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties that have greater resources available than we do our current or potential competitors might take advantage of the greater resources of the larger organization resulting from these acquisitions to compete more vigorously or broadly with us in addition continued industry consolidation might adversely affect end customers’ perceptions of the viability of smaller and even mediumsized networking companies and consequently end customers’ willingness to purchase from those companies further certain large end customers may develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products which could allow these end customers to become new competitors in the market 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

most of our competitors and some strategic alliance partners have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example broadcom acquired brocade communications systems extreme networks purchased certain data center networking assets from broadcombrocade and avaya dell acquired emc and hewlett packard enterprise acquired aruba networks 

moreover large system vendors are increasingly seeking to deliver toptobottom cloud networking solutions to end customers that combine cloudfocused hardware and software solutions to provide an alternative to our products 

we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations our relationship with our strategic alliance partners may shift as industry dynamics change for example companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors and could combine competitor product portfolios into unified offerings optimized for their platforms such changes could result in a reduction of business with us a change in the terms upon which they offer us their products and services or even a termination of our strategic partnerships entirely industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete with us including any competitors that seek to become sole source vendors for end customers this could lead to more variability in our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business the pricing of our solutions financial condition results of operations and prospects 

managing the supply of our products and product components is complex insufficient component supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing our extended supply chain is complex and our inventory management systems and related supplychain visibility tools may not enable us to forecast accurately and effectively manage the supply of our products and product components our ability to manage our supply chain may also be adversely affected by other factors including shortages of components used to manufacture our products a reduction or interruption of supply prioritization of component shipments to other vendors cessation of manufacturing of such components by our suppliers and geopolitical conditions such as the us trade war with china and the impact of public health epidemics like the coronavirus affecting china 

insufficient component supply or any increases in the time required to manufacture our products may lead to inventory shortages that could result in increased customer lead times for our products delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential end customers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available for example we have been delayed in ramping our 400g products because of the limited availability of optical components 

in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply from time to time we may issue purchase orders for components and products that are noncancelable and nonreturnable we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our component inventory suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or for products that are considered obsolete in addition we establish a liability and reimburse our contract manufacturer for component inventory purchased on our behalf that has been rendered excess or obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders or in cases where inventory levels greatly exceed our demand forecasts 

inventory management remains an increased area of focus as we balance the need to maintain sufficient inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of obsolescence or the end of life of certain products if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory or obsolete inventory we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory to its estimated realizable value which in turn could result in lower gross margins 

if we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

because some of the key components in our products come from sole or limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers and may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

our products rely on key components including merchant silicon chips integrated circuit components printed circuit boards connectors customtooled sheet metal and power supplies that we purchase or our contract manufacturers purchase on our behalf from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers generally we do not have guaranteed supply contracts with our component suppliers and our suppliers could suffer shortages delay shipments prioritize shipments to other vendors increase prices or cease manufacturing such products or selling them to us at any time supply of these components may also be adversely affected by industry consolidation which could result in increased component prices or fewer sourcing options as well as geopolitical conditions such as international trade wars like the us trade war with china and the impact of public health epidemics like the coronavirus currently affecting china for example in the past we have experienced shortages in inventory for dynamic random access memory integrated circuits and delayed releases of the next generation of chipset which delayed our production andor the release of our new products 

the development of alternate sources for those components is timeconsuming difficult and costly if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner or if we are unable to obtain alternative sources for these components sales of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products any of these events could result in lost sales reduced gross margins or damage to our end customer relationships which would adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our reliance on component suppliers also yields the potential for their infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property rights with respect to components which may be incorporated into our products we may not be indemnified by such component suppliers for such infringement or misappropriation claims any litigation for which we do not receive indemnification could require us to incur significant legal expenses in defending against such claims or require us to pay substantial royalty payments or settlement amounts that would not be reimbursed by our component suppliers 

our product development efforts are also dependent upon our continued collaboration with our key merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap we select specific merchant silicon from these vendors for each new product it is critical that we work in tandem with these vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features that our products take advantage of such improved features and that such vendors are able to supply us with sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable term to meet customer demand our relationship with these merchant silicon vendors enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions however merchant silicon vendors may not continue to collaborate with us or may become competitive with us by selling merchant silicon for “white boxes” or other products to our customers 

if our key merchant silicon vendors no longer collaborate in such a fashion if they do not continue to innovate if there are delays in the release of their products or supply shortages or if such merchant silicon is not offered to us on commercially reasonable terms our products may become less competitive own product launches could be delayed or we may be required to redesign our products to incorporate alternative merchant silicon which could result in lost sales reduce gross margins damage to our customer relationships or otherwise have a material effect on revenue and business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in the event of a shortage or supply interruption from our component suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner further longterm supply and maintenance obligations to end customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in addition our component suppliers change their selling prices frequently in response to market trends including industrywide increases in demand and because we do not have contracts with these suppliers or guaranteed pricing we are susceptible to availability or price fluctuations related to raw materials and components if we are unable to pass component price increases along to our end customers or maintain stable pricing our gross margins could be adversely affected and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

because we depend on thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping endcustomer orders on time if at all or on a costeffective basis which may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

we depend on thirdparty contract manufacturers to manufacture our product lines a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to these thirdparty contract manufacturers our reliance on these thirdparty contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process quality assurance product costs and product supply and timing which exposes us to risk to the extent that our products are manufactured at facilities in foreign countries we may be subject to additional risks associated with complying with local rules and regulations in those jurisdictions our reliance on contract manufacturers also yields the potential for their infringement of third party intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of our products or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of other customers’ products if we are unable to manage our relationships with our thirdparty contract manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers suffer delays or disruptions or quality control problems in their operations experience increased manufacturing lead times capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our end customers would be severely impaired and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be seriously harmed 

our contract manufacturers typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual orders we do not have longterm contracts with our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular pricing terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill 

our supply requirements which could result in supply shortages and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice for example a competitor could place large orders with the thirdparty manufacturer thereby utilizing all or substantially all of such thirdparty manufacturer’s capacity and leaving the manufacturer little or no capacity to fulfill our individual orders without price increases or delays or at all our contract with one of our contract manufacturers permits it to terminate the agreement for convenience subject to prior notice requirements we may not be able to develop alternate or second contract manufacturers in a timely manner 

if we add or change contract manufacturers or change any manufacturing plant locations within a contract manufacturer network we would add additional complexity and risk to our supply chain management and may increase our working capital requirements ensuring a new contract manufacturer or new plant location is qualified to manufacture our products to our standards and industry requirements could take significant effort and be time consuming and expensive any addition or change in manufacturers may be extremely costly time consuming and we may not be able to do so successfully 

in addition we may be subject to additional significant challenges to ensure that quality processes and costs among other issues are consistent with our expectations and those of our customers a new contract manufacturer or manufacturing location may not be able to scale its production of our products at the volumes or quality we require this could also adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers which could damage our customer relationships and cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end customers late delivery penalties delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins this could also result in increased levels of inventory subjecting us to increased excess and obsolete charges that could have a negative impact on our operating results 

any production interruptions or disruptions for any reason including those noted above as well as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages adverse results from intellectual property litigation or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would adversely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

product quality problems defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate advanced technologies including both hardware and software technologies despite testing prior to their release our products may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in analyzing correcting or redesigning the products cause us to lose significant end customers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

from time to time we have had to replace certain components of products that we had shipped and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs including failures in software protocols or defective component batches resulting in reliability issues in such products and we may be required to do so in the future we may also be required to provide full replacements or refunds for such defective products we cannot assure you that such remediation would not have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects see “—our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects” 

interruptions or delays in shipments could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

we may be subject to supply chain delays or endcustomer buying patterns in which a substantial portion of sales orders and shipments may occur in the second half of each quarter this places significant pressure on order review and processing supply chain management manufacturing inventory and quality control management shipping and trade compliance to ensure that we have properly forecasted supply purchasing manufacturing 

capacity inventory and quality compliance and logistics a significant interruption in these critical functions it could result in delayed order fulfillment adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

we base our inventory requirements on our forecasts of future sales if these forecasts are materially inaccurate we may procure inventory that we may be unable to use in a timely manner or at all 

we and our contract manufacturers procure components and build our products based on our forecasts these forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products which are in turn based on historical trends and analyses from our sales and marketing organizations adjusted for overall market conditions and other factors to the extent our forecasts are materially inaccurate or if we otherwise do not need such inventory we may under or overprocure inventory and such inaccuracies in our forecasts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the sales prices of our products and services may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our results of operations 

the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts a change in our mix of products and services the introduction of new products and services by us or by our competitors including the adoption of “white box” solutions promotional programs product and related warranty costs or broader macroeconomic factors in addition we have provided and may in the future provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers 

we have experienced declines in sales prices for our products and services competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and services additionally although we generally price our products and services worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may adversely affect actual prices that partners and end customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles decreased sales prices for any reason may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our result of operations 

our ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings and our failure to offer highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

once our products are deployed within our end customers’ networks our end customers depend on our support organization and our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products highquality support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products if we or our channel partners do not assist our end customers in deploying our products effectively do not succeed in helping our end customers resolve postdeployment issues quickly or do not provide adequate ongoing support or if we experience quality issues with these new products it could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing end customers and could harm our reputation with potential end customers in addition as we expand our operations internationally our support organization will face additional challenges including those associated with delivering support training and documentation in languages other than english our failure or the failure of our channel partners to maintain highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on end customers renewing their maintenance and support contracts any decline in maintenance renewals could harm our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we typically sell our products with maintenance and support as part of the initial purchase and a portion of our annual revenue comes from renewals of maintenance and support contracts our end customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance and support contracts after the expiration of the initial period and they may 

elect not to renew their maintenance and support contracts to renew their maintenance and support contracts at lower prices through alternative channel partners or to reduce the product quantity under their maintenance and support contracts thereby reducing our future revenue from maintenance and support contracts if our end customers especially our large end customers do not renew their maintenance and support contracts or if they renew them on terms that are less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

if we are unable to increase market awareness of our company and our products our revenue may not continue to grow or may decline 

we have not yet established broad market awareness of our products and services market awareness of our value proposition and products and services will be essential to our continued growth and our success particularly for the service provider and large enterprise markets if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful in creating market awareness of our company and our products and services then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth 

if we are unable to hire retain train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel particularly software engineering and sales personnel in addition our success in expanding into adjacent markets including the enterprise market requires a significant investment of time effort and financial resources into hiring and training our sales force to address these markets competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense especially in the san francisco bay area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have to provide more attractive compensation packages and other amenities research and development personnel are aggressively recruited by startup and growth companies which are especially active in many of the technical areas and geographic regions in which we conduct product development in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the hightechnology industry job candidates often consider the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to attract motivate or retain key employees if we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel or if there are delays in hiring required personnel our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be seriously harmed 

also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that such personnel has been improperly solicited that such personnel has divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that former employers own certain inventions or other work product such claims could result in litigation please see “we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us” 

we employ a number of foreign nationals who are required to obtain visas and entry permits in order to legally work in the united states and other countries the united states has recently increased the level of scrutiny in granting h1b l1 and other business visas and the current administration has indicated that immigration reform is a priority our compliance with united states immigration and labor laws could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain skilled professionals 

our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations our employment arrangements with our employees do not require that they continue to work for us for any specified period and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of our key personnel including jayshree ullal our chief executive officer andy bechtolsheim our founder and chief development officer kenneth duda our founder chief technology officer and svp of software engineering anshul sadana our chief operating officer or other members of our senior management team sales and marketing team or engineering team or any difficulty attracting or retaining other highly qualified personnel in the future could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we do not effectively expand and train our direct sales force we may be unable to add new end customers increase sales to our existing end customers andor successfully expand into new markets and our business will be adversely affected 

we depend on our direct sales force to obtain new end customers and increase sales with existing end customers as such we have invested and will continue to invest in our sales organization in recent periods we have been adding personnel and other resources to our sales function as we focus on growing our business entering new markets and increasing our market share and we expect to incur additional expenses in expanding our sales personnel in order to achieve revenue growth for example we expect to continue to invest significant time effort and financial resources into hiring and training our sales force to address the enterprise and campus markets despite our efforts we may not have significant experience selling to enterprise and campus customers and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these markets there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training retaining and integrating sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth particularly in international markets new hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect and we may be unable to hire retain or integrate into our corporate culture sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business in addition because we continue to grow rapidly a large percentage of our sales force is new to our company if we are unable to hire integrate and train a sufficient number of effective sales personnel or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new end customers or increasing sales to our existing endcustomer base our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected 

we are subject to a number of risks associated with the expansion of our international sales and operations 

our ability to grow our business and our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide we have a limited history of marketing selling and supporting our products and services internationally operating in a global marketplace we are subject to risks associated with having an international reach and requirements such as compliance with applicable anticorruption laws 

one such applicable anticorruption law is the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and its employees and intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business securing an advantage and directing business to another and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors officers employees agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives as such if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation governmental authorities in the us and elsewhere could seek to impose civil andor criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions failure to comply with anticorruption and antibribery laws such as the fcpa and the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 or the uk bribery act and similar laws associated with our activities outside the us could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences we intend to increase our international sales and business and as such the risk of violating laws such as the fcpa and uk bribery act increases 

additionally the us government has adopted broader sanctions and embargoes that generally forbid supplying many items to or involving certain countries territories governments legal entities and individuals including restrictions imposed by the us and eu on exports to russia and ukraine we have implemented systems to detect and prevent sales into these countries or to prohibit entities or individuals but we are necessarily dependent in part on our thirdparty suppliers and distributors to implement these systems we cannot assure you that these systems will always be effective or that our suppliers and distributors effectively implement our systems to detect and prevent such sales without our prior knowledge and we may incur additional unexpected costs or expenses to comply with applicable trade restrictions 

as a result of our international reach we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining 

an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or to recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the us and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in endcustomer contracts although to date we generally have not done so to the extent that we may enter into endcustomer contracts in the future that include nonstandard terms related to payment warranties or performance obligations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 

 these and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenue and consequently materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects expanding our existing 

international operations and entering into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial commitments our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit our future growth or materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

moreover our business is also impacted by the negotiation and implementation of free trade agreements between the united states and other countries such agreements can reduce barriers to international trade and thus the cost of conducting business overseas for instance the united states recently reached a new trilateral trade agreement with the governments of canada and mexico to replace the north american free trade agreement “nafta” if the united states withdraws from nafta and the three countries fail to approve the new agreements known as the united statesmexicocanada agreement our cost of doing business within the three countries could increase 

we are subject to risks related to brexit 

on january 31 2020 the united kingdom or uk left the european union or eu commonly referred to as the “brexit” brexit creates an uncertain political and economic environment in the uk and potentially across other eu member states for the foreseeable future including during any period while the terms of the future relationship between the uk and eu are being negotiated and such uncertainties could impair or limit our ability to transact business in the member eu states additionally there also is a risk that other countries may decide to leave the eu 

further brexit could adversely affect european and worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial markets and the value of the pound sterling currency or other currencies including the euro we are exposed to the economic market and fiscal conditions in the uk and the eu and to changes in any of these conditions consequently no assurance can be given as to the impact of brexit or continued uncertainty regarding it and in particular no assurance can be given that our operating results financial condition and prospects would not be adversely impacted by the result 

enhanced united states tax tariff importexport restrictions chinese regulations or other trade barriers may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

there is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united states and various other countries most significantly china with respect trade policies treaties tariffs and taxes including trade policies and tariffs regarding china in 2018 the office of the us trade representative the “ustr” enacted a tariff of 10 on imports into the us from china including communications equipment products and components manufactured and imported from china since then additional tariffs have been imposed by the ustr on imports into the united states from china and china has also imposed tariffs on imports into china from the united states although the united states and china signed an interim trade agreement in january 2020 the parties are continuing to negotiate a trade agreement 

if tariffs trade restrictions or trade barriers are placed on products such as ours by foreign governments especially china our costs may increase we believe we can adjust our supply chain and manufacturing practices to minimize the impact of the tariffs but our efforts may not be successful there can be no assurance that we will not experience a disruption in our business related to these or other changes in trade practices and the process of changing suppliers in order to mitigate any such tariff costs could be complicated timeconsuming and costly 

the us tariffs may also cause customers to delay orders as they evaluate where to take delivery of our products in connection with their efforts to mitigate their own tariff exposure such delays create forecasting difficulties for us and increase the risk that orders might be canceled or might never be placed current or future tariffs imposed by the us may also negatively impact our customers sales thereby causing an indirect negative impact on our own sales even in the absence of further tariffs the related uncertainty and the markets fear of an escalating trade war might cause our distributors and customers to place fewer orders for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity financial condition andor results of operations 

given the relatively fluid regulatory environment in china and the united states and uncertainty how the us administration or foreign governments will act with respect to tariffs international trade agreements and 

policies a trade war further governmental action related to tariffs or international trade policies or additional tax or other regulatory changes in the future could directly and adversely impact our financial results and results of operations 

sales of our 7000 series of switches generate most of our product revenue and if we are unable to continue to grow sales of these products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

historically we have derived substantially all of our product revenue from sales of our 7000 series of switches and we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future we have experienced declines in sales prices for our products including our 10 gigabit ethernet modular and fixed switches a decline in the price of our 7000 series of switches and related services or our inability to increase sales of these products would harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects more seriously than if we derived significant revenue from a larger variety of product lines and services our future financial performance will also depend upon successfully developing and selling nextgeneration versions of our 7000 series of switches if we fail to deliver new products new features or new releases that end customers want and that allow us to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

seasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations 

we operate on a december 31st year end and believe that there are significant seasonal factors which may cause sequential product revenue growth to be greater for the second and fourth quarters of our year than our first and third quarters we believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors including the procurement budgeting and deployment cycles of many of our end customers our rapid historical growth may have reduced the impact of seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date as our increasing size causes our growth rate to slow seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

assessing our processes procedures and staffing in order to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes many of which are done manually and are dependent upon individual data input or review these processes include but are not limited to calculating revenue inventory costs and the preparation of our statement of cash flows while we continue to automate our processes and enhance our review controls to reduce the likelihood for errors we expect that for the foreseeable future many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error 

we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 

from time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent copyright commercial product liability employment class action whistleblower and other litigation in addition to governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources cause us to incur significant expenses or liability andor require us to change our business practices for example we were previously involved in litigation with cisco and optumsoft because of the potential risks expenses and uncertainties of litigation we may from time to time settle disputes even where we have meritorious claims or defenses although we have insurance which may provide coverage for some kinds of claims we may face that insurance may not cover some kinds of claims or types of relief and may not be adequate in a particular case because litigation is inherently unpredictable we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

for more information regarding the litigation in which we are currently involved see the “legal proceedings” subheading in note 7 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k is incorporated herein by reference 

assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights or other lawsuits asserted against us could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network infrastructure and wifi industries and have resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies many companies in the network infrastructure and wifi industries including our competitors and other third parties as well as nonpracticing entities own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us from time to time they have or may in the future also assert such claims against us our end customers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties for example we have previously been involved in litigation with cisco and optumsoft 

as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur or if we enter into new markets claims of infringement misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase any claim of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim distract our management from our business and require us to cease use of such intellectual property in addition some claims for patent infringement may relate to subcomponents that we purchase from third parties if these third parties are unable or unwilling to indemnify us for these claims we could be substantially harmed 

the patent portfolios of most of our competitors are larger than ours this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent crosslicenses in addition future assertions of patent rights by third parties and any resulting litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection we cannot assure you that we are not infringing or otherwise violating any thirdparty intellectual property rights 

the thirdparty asserters of intellectual property claims may be unreasonable in their demands or may simply refuse to settle which could lead to expensive settlement payments prolonged periods of litigation and related expenses additional burdens on employees or other resources distraction from our business supply stoppages and lost sales 

an adverse outcome of a dispute including those lawsuits described under the “legal proceedings” subheading in note 7 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k  may require us to pay substantial damages or penalties including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party’s patents cease making licensing using or importing into the us products or services that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others expend additional development resources to attempt to redesign our products or services or otherwise to develop noninfringing technology which may not be successful enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or intellectual property rights and indemnify our partners and other third parties any damages penalties or royalty obligations we may become subject to as a result of an adverse outcome and any thirdparty indemnity we may need to provide could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects royalty or licensing agreements if required or desirable may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures further there is little or no information publicly available concerning market or fair values for license fees which can lead to overpayment of license or settlement fees in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us suppliers subject to thirdparty intellectual property claims also may choose or be forced to discontinue or alter their arrangements with us with little or no advance notice to us any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in the event that we are found to infringe any third party intellectual property we could be enjoined or subject to other remedial orders that would prohibit us from making licensing using or importing into the us 

such products or services in order to resume such activities with respect to any affected products or services we or our component suppliers would be required to develop technical redesigns to this third party intellectual property that no longer infringe the third party intellectual property in any efforts to develop technical redesigns for these products or services we or our component suppliers may be unable to do so in a manner that does not continue to infringe the third party intellectual property or that is acceptable to our customers these redesign efforts could be extremely costly and time consuming as well as disruptive to our other development activities and distracting to management moreover such redesigns could require us to obtain approvals from the court or administrative body to resume the activities with respect to these affected solutions we may not be successful in our efforts to obtain such approvals in a timely manner or at all any failure to effectively redesign our solutions or to obtain timely approval of those redesigns by a court or administrative body may cause a disruption to our product shipments and materially and adversely affect our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition for example in two prior investigations brought by cisco in the international trade commission “itc” we were subjected to remedial orders that prohibited us from importing and selling after importation any products the itc found to infringe cisco’s patents as a result we were required to redesign certain aspects of our products and obtain us customs and border protection’s approval of those redesigns before we could continue to import those products into the united states 

our standard sales contracts contain indemnification provisions requiring us to defend our end customers against thirdparty claims including against infringement of certain intellectual property rights that could expose us to losses which could seriously harm our business financial conditions results of operations and prospects 

under the indemnification provisions of our standard sales contracts we agree to defend our end customers and channel partners against thirdparty claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights which may include patents copyrights trademarks or trade secrets and to pay judgments entered on such claims an adverse ruling in such litigation may potentially expose us to claims in the event that claims are brought against our customers based on the ruling and we are required to indemnify such customers 

our exposure under these indemnification provisions is frequently limited to the total amount paid by our end customer under the agreement however certain agreements include indemnification provisions that could potentially expose us to losses in excess of the amount received under the agreement any of these events including claims for indemnification could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights 

we depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology we rely on trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection 

the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner we may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions further we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims to the extent that additional patents are issued from our patent applications which is not certain they may be contested circumvented or invalidated in the future moreover the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages and as with any technology competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future in addition we rely on confidentiality or license agreements with third parties in connection with their use of our products and technology there is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements or that we will be able to adequately enforce our rights in part because we rely on “shrinkwrap” licenses in some instances 

we have not registered our trademarks in all geographic markets failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our ability to enforce and defend our trademark rights and result in indemnification claims further any claim of infringement by a third party even those claims without merit could cause us to incur 

substantial costs defending against such claim could divert management attention from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property in certain geographic markets 

despite our efforts the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the united states 

detecting and protecting against the unauthorized use of our products technology and proprietary rights is expensive difficult and in some cases impossible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources either of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and there is no guarantee that we would be successful furthermore many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to protecting their technology or intellectual property rights than we do accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property which could result in a substantial loss of our market share 

we rely on the availability of licenses to thirdparty software and other intellectual property 

many of our products and services include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties and we otherwise use software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties in our business this exposes us to risks over which we may have little or no control for example a licensor may have difficulties keeping up with technological changes or may stop supporting the software or other intellectual property that it licenses to us also it will be necessary in the future to renew licenses expand the scope of existing licenses or seek new licenses relating to various aspects of these products and services or otherwise relating to our business which may result in increased license fees these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms if at all in addition a third party may assert that we or our end customers are in breach of the terms of a license which could among other things give such third party the right to terminate a license or seek damages from us or both the inability to obtain or maintain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain or maintain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in releases of products and services and could otherwise disrupt our business until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and services or otherwise in the conduct of our business moreover the inclusion in our products and services of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis may limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software that we use if we combine our software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release portions of the source code of our software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products moreover we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products will be effective if we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products on 

terms that are not economically feasible to reengineer our products to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available in source code form our proprietary code any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products must interoperate with operating systems software applications and hardware that is developed by others and if we are unable to devote the necessary resources to ensure that our products interoperate with such software and hardware we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening demand for our products 

generally our products comprise only a part of the data center and must interoperate with our end customers’ existing infrastructure specifically their networks servers software and operating systems which may be manufactured by a wide variety of vendors and original equipment manufacturers or oems our products must comply with established industry standards in order to interoperate with the servers storage software and other networking equipment in the data center such that all systems function efficiently together we depend on the vendors of servers and systems in a data center to support prevailing industry standards often these vendors are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are also some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our end customers 

in addition when new or updated versions of these software operating systems or applications are introduced we must sometimes develop updated versions of our software so that our products will interoperate properly we may not accomplish these development efforts quickly costeffectively or at all these development efforts require capital investment and the devotion of engineering resources if we fail to maintain compatibility with these systems and applications our end customers may not be able to adequately utilize our products and we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening in demand for our products among other consequences which would adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we provide access to our software and other selected source code to certain partners which creates additional risk that our competitors could develop products that are similar to or better than ours 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our internally developed technology which is incorporated in the source code for our products we seek to protect the source code design code documentation and other information relating to our software under trade secret patent and copyright laws however we have chosen to provide access to selected source code of our software to several of our partners for codevelopment as well as for open apis formats and protocols though we generally control access to our source code and other intellectual property and enter into confidentiality or license agreements with such partners as well as with our employees and consultants this combination of procedural and contractual safeguards may be insufficient to protect our trade secrets and other rights to our technology our protective measures may be inadequate especially because we may not be able to prevent our partners employees or consultants from violating any agreements or licenses we may have in place or abusing their access granted to our source code improper disclosure or use of our source code could help competitors develop products similar to or better than ours 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and to be adversely affected by numerous factors 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and the gross margins we have achieved in recent years may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including 



 we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quarter to quarter failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense as a result our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly 

the timing of our sales and revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of our products’ sales cycles a sales cycle is the period between initial contact with a prospective end customer and any sale of our products endcustomer orders often involve the purchase of multiple products these orders are complex and difficult to complete because prospective end customers generally consider a number of factors over an extended period of time before committing to purchase the products and solutions we sell end customers especially in the case of our large end customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision and require considerable time to evaluate test and qualify our products prior to making a purchase decision and placing an order the length of time that end customers devote to their evaluation contract negotiation and budgeting processes varies significantly our products’ sales cycles can be lengthy in certain cases especially with respect to our prospective large end customers during the sales cycle we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities and make investments in evaluation equipment all of which lower our operating margins particularly if no sale occurs even if an end customer decides to purchase our products there are many factors affecting the timing of our recognition of revenue which makes our revenue difficult to forecast for example there may be unexpected delays in an end customer’s internal procurement processes particularly for some of our larger end customers for which our products represent a very small percentage of their total procurement activity there are many other factors specific to end customers that contribute to the timing of 

their purchases and the variability of our revenue recognition including the strategic importance of a particular project to an end customer budgetary constraints and changes in their personnel 

even after an end customer makes a purchase there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase in addition the significance and timing of our product enhancements and the introduction of new products by our competitors may also affect end customers’ purchases for all of these reasons it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed the particular period in which a sale will be completed or the period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized if our sales cycles lengthen our revenue could be lower than expected which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release they have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our end customers’ willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our products could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our products could result in claims by end customers for losses that they sustain if end customers make these types of claims we may be required or may choose for endcustomer relations or other reasons to expend additional resources in order to address the problem we may also be required to repair or replace such products or provide a refund for the purchase price for such products liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale and those of our resellers and distributors may not be enforceable under some circumstances or may not fully or effectively protect us from endcustomer claims and related liabilities and costs including indemnification obligations under our agreements with end customers resellers and distributors the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in expenditures of funds in connection with litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

levels or types of insurance coverage purchased may not adequately cover claims or liabilities 

we maintain insurance to protect against certain types of claims associated with the use of our products operations property damage casualty and other risks but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover all claims or penalties depending on our assumptions regarding level of risk availability cost and other considerations we purchase differing amounts of insurance from time to time and in various locations our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and policy limits that may require us to selfinsure certain types of claims or claims in certain countries if our level of insurance is inadequate or a loss isn’t covered by insurance we could be required to pay unpredictable and substantial amounts that could have a substantial negative impact on our financial results or operations 

in addition to our own direct sales force we rely on distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers to sell our products and our failure to effectively develop manage or prevent disruptions to our distribution channels and the processes and procedures that support them could cause a reduction in the number of end customers of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon maintaining our relationships with distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers and establishing additional sales channel relationships we anticipate that sales of our products to a limited number of channel partners will continue to account for a material portion of our total product revenue for the foreseeable future we provide our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our products but these steps may not be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services if we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive programs for our channel partners we may not be able to incentivize these 

partners to sell our products to end customers these partners may have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our products altogether one of our channel partners could elect to consolidate or enter into a strategic partnership with one of our competitors which could reduce or eliminate our future opportunities with that channel partner our agreements with our channel partners may generally be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice we may be unable to retain these channel partners or secure additional or replacement channel partners the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners requires extensive training and any new or expanded relationship with a channel partner may take several months or more to achieve productivity 

where we rely on the channel partners for sales of our products we may have little or no contact with the ultimate users of our products that purchase through such channel partners thereby making it more difficult for us to establish brand awareness ensure proper delivery and installation of our products service ongoing endcustomer requirements estimate endcustomer demand and respond to evolving endcustomer needs in addition our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to end customers fail to comply with their contractual obligations or violate laws or our corporate policies if we fail to effectively manage our existing sales channels or if our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our products if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of highquality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

we anticipate increasing our sales efforts to us and foreign federal state and local governmental end customers in the future sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we have attained revised certifications government demand and payment for our products and services may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects selling to government entities may also require us to comply with various regulations that are not applicable to sales to nongovernment entities including regulations that may relate to pricing classified material and other matters complying with such regulations may also require us to put in place controls and procedures to monitor compliance with the applicable regulations that may be costly or not possible we are not currently certified to perform work under classified contracts with government entities failure to comply with any such regulations could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government ceasing to buy our products and services a reduction of revenue fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the us government may require certain products that it purchases to be manufactured in the us and other relatively highcost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet these requirements any of these and other circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we may invest in or acquire other businesses which could require significant management attention disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we may make investments in complementary companies products or technologies which could involve licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in 

or acquisitions of other companies for example we completed the acquisition of big switch networks in february 2020 the acquisition of mojo in august 2018 and the acquisition of metamako in september 2018 however we do not have significant experience in making investments in other companies nor had we made any acquisitions prior to those of big switch networks mojo and metamako and as a result our ability as an organization to evaluate andor complete investments or acquire and integrate other companies products or technologies in a successful manner is unproven we may not be able to find suitable investment or acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete such investments or acquisitions on favorable terms if at all if we do complete investments or acquisitions we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and any investments or acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end customers investors and securities analysts 

in addition investments and acquisitions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures for example if we are unsuccessful at integrating any acquisitions or retaining key talent from those acquisitions or the technologies associated with such acquisitions into our company the business financial condition results of operations and prospects of the combined company could be adversely affected we may have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business or the acquired technologies or research and development expectations may prove unsuccessful any integration process may require significant time and resources and we may not be able to manage the process successfully acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel or accurately forecast the financial effects of an acquisition transaction including accounting charges any acquisition or investment could expose us to unknown liabilities moreover we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such investment or acquisition each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations moreover if the investment or acquisition becomes impaired we may be required to take an impairment charge which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock 

furthermore through acquisitions we continue to expand into new markets and new market segments and we may experience challenges in entering into new market segments for which we have not previously manufactured and sold products including facing exposure to new market risks difficulty achieving expected business results due to a lack of experience in new markets products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar distribution partners or vendors 

if we needed to raise additional capital to expand our operations invest in new products or for other corporate purposes our failure to do so on favorable terms could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future if we did need to raise additional funds to expand our operations invest in new products or for other corporate purposes we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms if at all if we raise additional equity financing our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our common stock could decline furthermore if we engage in debt financing the holders of such debt would have priority over the holders of common stock and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or impose other restrictions on our business we may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders including maintaining specified liquidity or other ratios any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms if at all we may not be able to among other things 



 our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as described in part ii item 7 of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities equity revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation and contract manufacturersupplier liabilities income taxes and loss contingencies if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions our results of operations may be adversely affected and may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

we are exposed to the credit risk of our channel partners and some of our end customers which could result in material losses   

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with standard payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the us we monitor individual endcustomer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the end customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts we are unable to recognize revenue from shipments until the collection of those amounts becomes reasonably assured any significant delay or default in the collection of significant accounts receivable could result in an increased need for us to obtain working capital from other sources possibly on worse terms than we could have negotiated if we had established such working capital resources prior to such delays or defaults any significant default could adversely affect our results of operations and delay our ability to recognize revenue 

a material portion of our sales is derived through our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers some of our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers may experience financial difficulties which could adversely affect our collection of accounts receivable distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other systems integrators valueadded resellers and end customers distributors represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be less likely to have the reserve resources required to meet payment obligations our exposure to credit risks of our channel partners may increase if our channel partners and their end customers are adversely affected by global or regional economic conditions one or more of these channel partners could delay payments or default on credit extended to them either of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening us dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our end customers outside of the us which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase our product and operating costs in foreign locations further an increasing portion of our operating 

expenses is incurred outside the us is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates if we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with the currency fluctuations our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods health epidemics and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

our corporate headquarters and the operations of our key manufacturing vendors logistics providers and partners as well as many of our customers are located in areas exposed to risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis including the san francisco bay area japan and taiwan a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake tsunami fire or a flood or other catastrophic event such as a disease outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our or their business which could in turn materially affect our financial condition results of operations and prospects 

for example in december 2019 a strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in wuhan china any health epidemic in asia could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain components for our products that are supplied from asia or to manufacture our products in asia any such disruption of our suppliers or our contract manufacturers would likely impact our sales and operating results in addition a health epidemic could adversely affect the economies of many countries resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and likely impact our operating results 

additionally in the event our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed which could result in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter further if a natural disaster occurs in a region from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue end customers in that region may delay or forego purchases of our products which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or end customers or the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or end customers that affects sales at the end of our quarter could have a particularly significant adverse effect on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if our disaster recovery plans and those of our manufacturers logistics providers or partners prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of endcustomer orders or delays in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected 

breaches of our cybersecurity systems or other security breaches or incidents with respect to networks systems or data could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services to our customers delay our ability to recognize revenue compromise the integrity of our software products and our networks systems and data result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property damage our reputation expose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data 

we increasingly depend upon our it systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners computer programmers or other persons or organizations may attempt to penetrate our network security or that of our website or systems and access or obtain confidential personal or otherwise sensitive or proprietary information about us or our customers or cause interruptions of our service because the techniques used to access or sabotage networks and systems change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition our software and sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could cause the software or applications to fail or otherwise to unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system we have also outsourced a number of our business functions to thirdparties including our manufacturers logistics providers and cloud service providers and our business operations also depend in 

part on the success of these third parties’ own cybersecurity measures similarly we rely upon distributors resellers and system integrators to sell our products and our sales operations depend in part on the reliability of their cybersecurity measures additionally we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our it resources with the use of security measures designed to prevent exposure of our network systems to security breaches and the loss of data we and all of the aforementioned third parties also face the risk of malicious software phishing schemes and other social engineering methods fraud and other malfeasance and intentional or negligent acts or omissions of employees and contractors accordingly if our cybersecurity systems and measures or those of any of the aforementioned third parties fail to protect against sophisticated cyber attacks the mishandling of data by employees and contractors or any other means of unauthorized access to or use of networks systems or data that we or such third parties maintain operate or process our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways including 

 should any of the above events occur or be perceived to occur we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our customers and others and regulatory investigations and actions from governmental agencies and we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to remediate and otherwise address any data security incident or breach including to notify individuals entities or regulatory bodies and to implement measures in an effort to prevent further breaches or incidents in addition our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised and our reputation and competitive position could be significantly harmed also the regulatory and contractual actions litigations investigations fines penalties and liabilities relating to data breaches that result in losses of damage or destruction of or unauthorized access to or acquisition of credit card information or other personal or sensitive data of users of our services can be significant in terms of fines and reputational impact and necessitate changes to our business operations that may be disruptive to us additionally we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and other measures in an effort to prevent security breaches and other incidents even the perception of inadequate security may damage our reputation and negatively impact our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers consequently our financial performance and results of operations could be adversely affected by any of the foregoing types of security breaches incidents vulnerabilities or other matters or the perception that any of them have occurred 

in addition we cannot assure that any limitation of liability provisions in our customer agreements contracts with thirdparty vendors and service providers or other contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim relating to a security breach or other securityrelated matter we also cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for data handling or data security liabilities actually incurred that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all or that any future claim will not be excluded or otherwise be denied coverage by any insurer the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or coinsurance requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business including our reputation financial condition and operating results 

we believe our longterm value as a company will be greater if we focus primarily on growth instead of profitability 

our business strategy is to focus primarily on our longterm growth as a result our profitability in any given period may be lower than it would be if our strategy was to maximize shortterm profitability expenditures on research and development sales and marketing infrastructure and other such investments may not ultimately grow our business prospects or cause long term profitability for example in order to support our strong growth we have accelerated our investment in infrastructure such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations as a result we expect our levels of operating profit could decline in the short to medium term if we are ultimately unable to achieve or maintain profitability at the level anticipated by analysts and our stockholders the market price of our common stock may decline 

we may not generate positive returns on our research and development investments 

developing our products is expensive and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  our research and development expenses were 4628 million  or approximately 192 of our revenue 4425 million  or approximately 206 of our revenue and 3496 million  or approximately 212 of our revenue respectively we expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts by investing in research and development we believe we will be well positioned to take advantage of our large market opportunity we expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these investments these investments may take several years to generate positive returns if ever 

changes in our income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application of existing tax laws of various jurisdictions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including earnings that are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our ability to generate and use tax attributes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the federal research and development “rd” tax credit laws transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement and legal structure tax effects of nondeductible compensation including certain stockbased compensation tax costs related to intercompany realignments changes in accounting principles adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries or customers a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain foreign earnings or changes in tax laws and regulations including the tax act enacted on december 22 2017 and the new us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 

significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions and determine our income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect income taxes or additional paidin capital in addition tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as evidenced by the tax act as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied our income taxes may be affected changes to us tax laws including taxation of earnings outside of the us the introduction of a base erosion antiabuse tax and the disallowance of tax deductions for certain book expense as well as changes to us tax laws that may be enacted in the future could impact the tax treatment of our earnings as well as cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change for example on june 7 2019 the court of appeals for the ninth circuit issued an opinion on altera corporation and subsidiaries vs commissioner on internal revenue the opinion the opinion overturned the tax court decision and ruled in favor of the commissioner validating the regulations requiring stockbased compensation to be included in a cost sharing arrangement as a result of the opinion we have changed our position and determined it is more likely than not that these regulations are valid 

and recognized an income tax expense of 98 million for the cumulative effect of this position in the period ending june 30 2019 

further we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities audits by the internal revenue service or other tax authorities are subject to inherent uncertainties and could result in unfavorable outcomes including potential fines or penalties as we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions the expense of defending and resolving such an audit may be significant the amount of time to resolve an audit is also unpredictable and may divert management’s attention from our business operations we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our income taxes we cannot assure you that fluctuations in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application or interpretation of existing tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns by tax authorities will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements of the exchange act the listing requirements of the new york stock exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or the sarbanesoxley act and the doddfrank act compliance with these rules and regulations and the attendant responsibilities of management and the board may make it more difficult to attract and retain executive officers and members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee has increased our legal and financial compliance costs and increased demand on our systems and resources among other things the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in addition if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 we could be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs pay fines settlements or judgments as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in addition changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies and increasing legal and financial compliance costs these laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from business activities to compliance activities if our efforts to comply with new laws regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business and prospects may be harmed 

in addition as a result of our disclosure obligations as a public company we may be under pressure to focus on shortterm results which may adversely affect our ability to undertake certain actions which could improve our longterm financial performance 

failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business is subject to regulation by various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety environmental laws consumer protection laws privacy data protection antibribery laws importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the united states for example the european union or eu has implemented 

the general data protection regulation “gdpr” the gdpr provides for substantial obligations relating to the handling storage and other processing of data relating to individuals and administrative fines for violations which can be up four percent of the previous year’s annual revenue or €20 million whichever is higher several jurisdictions have passed new laws and regulations relating to privacy data protection and other matters and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions these laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” became operative on january 1 2020 the ccpa requires covered companies to among other things provide new disclosures to california consumers and affords such consumers new abilities to optout of certain sales of personal information certain aspects of the ccpa and its interpretation remain uncertain and are likely to remain uncertain for an extended period and we cannot predict the full impact of the ccpa on our business or operations complying with emerging and changing legal and regulatory requirements relating to privacy data protection and other matters may cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

from time to time we may receive inquiries from governmental agencies or we may make voluntary disclosures regarding our compliance with applicable governmental regulations or requirements relating to various matters including importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations which could lead to formal investigations actual or alleged noncompliance with applicable laws regulations or other governmental requirements could lead to regulatory investigations enforcement actions and other proceedings private claims and litigation and potentially may subject us to sanctions mandatory product recalls enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages civil and criminal penalties or injunctions if any governmental fines penalties or other sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected in addition responding to any investigation action or other proceeding will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees enforcement actions investigations and fines penalties and other sanctions could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls 

our products may be subject to various export controls and because we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products certain of our products may be exported from various countries only with the required export license or through an export license exception if we were to fail to comply with the applicable export control laws customs regulations economic sanctions or other applicable laws we could be subject to monetary damages or the imposition of restrictions which could be material to our business operating results and prospects and could also harm our reputation further there could be criminal penalties for knowing or willful violations including incarceration for culpable employees and managers obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities furthermore certain export control and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products technology software and services to embargoed countries and sanctioned governments entities and persons even though we take precautions to ensure that we and our channel partners comply with all relevant regulations any failure by us or our channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences including reputational harm government investigations and penalties 

as our company grows we also continue developing procedures and controls to comply with export control and other applicable laws historically we have had some instances where we inadvertently have not fully complied with certain export control laws but we have disclosed them to and implemented corrective actions with the appropriate government agencies 

in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including through import permit and license requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our end customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or 

potential end customers with international operations or create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we or our partners fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition results of operations prospects and reputation could be adversely affected 

we and our partners including our contract manufacturers are subject to various local state federal and international environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection recycling and disposal of electrical and electronic equipment examples of these laws and regulations include the eus restrictions of the use of hazardous substances directive or rohs directive and the eus waste electrical and electronic equipment directive or weee directive as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the us and we or our partners including our contract manufacturers are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

the eu rohs directive and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products our products currently comply with the rohs directive however if there are future changes to this directive we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes our failure or the failure of our partners including our contract manufacturers to comply with past present and future environmental laws could result in fines penalties thirdparty claims reduced sales of our products substantial product inventory writeoffs and reputational damage any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we also expect that our business will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis applicable to us and our partners including our contract manufacturers to date our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows although we cannot predict the future effect of such laws or regulations they will likely result in additional costs or require us to change the content or manufacturing of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products 

as a public company we are subject to requirements under the doddfrank act that require us to perform diligence and disclose and report whether or not our products contain “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer’s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict minerals” 

the implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products in addition we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements including costs related to conducting diligence procedures and if applicable potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities we may also face reputational harm or loss sales if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflictfree or if we are unable to alter our products processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials 

risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock 

the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the value of your investment could decline 

the trading price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control these 

fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following 

 in addition technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility and if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company if the market price of our common stock is volatile we may become the target of securities litigation securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business and prospects this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that such sales might occur could reduce the market price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us 

based on shares outstanding as of december 31 2019  holders of approximately 231 of our common stock have rights subject to some conditions to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders in addition we have registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans if holders by exercising their registration rights sell large numbers of shares it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we may also issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in connection with a financing acquisition our equity incentive plans or otherwise any such issuances would result in dilution to our existing stockholders and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 

insiders have substantial control over us which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions including a change of control 

our directors executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 10 of our outstanding common stock together with their affiliates in the aggregate beneficially own approximately 226 of the outstanding shares of our common stock based on shares outstanding as of december 31 2019  as a result these stockholders if acting together could exercise a significant level of influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests this concentration of ownership may also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock or otherwise may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change of control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock 

we have not paid dividends in the past and do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared nor paid any dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases 

we have adopted a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock however any future decisions to reduce or discontinue repurchasing our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 

although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program any determination to execute our stock repurchase program will be subject to among other things our financial position and results of operations available cash and cash flow capital requirements and other factors as well as our board of director’s continuing determination that the repurchase program is in the best interests of our shareholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase program our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock if we fail to meet any expectations related to stock repurchases the market price of our common stock could decline and could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence additionally price volatility of our common stock over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our common stock to exceed the stock’s market price at a given point in time 

we may further increase or decrease the amount of repurchases of our common stock in the future any reduction or discontinuance by us of repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our current share repurchase authorization program could cause the market price of our common stock to decline moreover in the event repurchases of our common stock are reduced or discontinued our failure or inability to resume repurchasing common stock at historical levels could result in a lower market valuation of our common stock 

if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business or prospects the market price of our common stock and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock to some extent depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business or prospects we do not have any control over these analysts recently more than one of the analysts who cover us have downgraded our shares and changed their 

opinion of our shares which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline if one or more of these analysts should cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which could cause the market price of our common stock or trading volume to decline 

our charter documents and delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

 in addition as a delaware corporation we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law these provisions may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time

overview 

arista networks pioneered softwaredriven cognitive cloud networking for largescale data center and campus environments our cloud networking solutions consist of our eos a set of network applications and our ethernet switching and routing platforms our cloud networking solutions deliver industryleading performance scalability availability programmability automation and visibility at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was purposebuilt to be fully programmable highly modular and reliable the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services 

we believe that cloud networking will continue to replace legacy network technologies across data center and campus environments our cloud networking platforms are well positioned to address the growing cloud networking market and to address increasing performance requirements driven by the growing number of connected devices as well as the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications 

we generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching and routing products which incorporate our eos software we generate the majority of our services revenue from post contract support or pcs which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others as we have grown the functionality of our eos software expanded the range of our product portfolio and increased the size of our sales force our revenue has grown rapidly we have also been profitable and operating cash flow positive for each year since 2010 

we believe our future success is dependent upon our ability to continue to develop market leading products and features that address the needs of our end customers and our ability to sell these products to new and existing customers including an increase in sales in the enterprise data center switching campus and wifi networking markets we intend to continue expanding our sales force and marketing activities in key geographies as well as our relationships with channel technology and systemlevel partners in order to reach new end customers more effectively increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support in addition we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking 

platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our rapid development of new features and applications 

our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our eos software and enhancements to eos we engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture today we combine our eos software with merchant silicon into a family of switching and routing products this enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions we work closely with third party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third party direct fulfillment facilities we and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling final configuration quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers 

historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue we have experienced unpredictability in the timing of orders from these large end customers primarily due to changes in demand patterns specific to these customers the time it takes these end customers to evaluate test qualify and accept our products and the overall complexity of these large orders we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis for example our sales to microsoft and facebook as end users in fiscal 2019 represented 23 and 17 of our revenue respectively and benefited from certain factors that are not expected to repeat in fiscal 2020 consequently the percentage of our revenue from microsoft and facebook in fiscal 2020 is expected to decline which will likely negatively impact our revenue growth in addition we have provided and may in the future provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur

revenue by geography in thousands except percentages 



revenue 

we generate revenue primarily from sales of our products we also derive a portion of our revenue from sales of pcs which is typically purchased in conjunction with our products and subsequent renewals of those contracts we expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on among other things the timing size and complexity of orders especially with respect to our large end customers 

product revenue increased 1801 million  or 98  in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018  the increase was primarily driven by increased demand from both new and existing customers and the recognition of product deferred revenue related to sales in the prior year for which revenue was recognized in 2019 service revenue increased 793 million  or 256 in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base has continued to expand international revenues represented 239 of total revenues in the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 279 in 2018 which was primarily due to a move toward us deployments by certain of our large end customers during 2019 we continue to experience pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition but demand for our products and growth in our installed base has more than offset this pricing pressure during the year however we have experienced reduced and volatile demand from certain of our large end customers during 2019 and expect this could continue in future periods which could impact our future revenue growth 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

cost of revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our thirdparty contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors overhead costs in our manufacturing operations department and other manufacturingrelated costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory cost of providing pcs and other services primarily consists of personnel costs for our global customer support organization 

cost of revenue increased 884 million or 114 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018  the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to the corresponding increases in product and service revenues 

gross margin or gross profit as a percentage of revenue has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing manufacturingrelated costs including costs associated with supply chain sourcing activities merchant silicon costs the mix of products sold and excessobsolete inventory writedowns including charges for excessobsolete component inventory held by our contract manufacturers we expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above 

gross margin increased to 641 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 638 in 2018  the increase in gross margin was primarily driven by an increase in product margins due to favorable customer mix with lower discounts on smaller volume transactions partially offset by increased product transition costs including excess and obsolete inventoryrelated charges 

operating expenses in thousands except percentages 

our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing general and administrative expenses and legal settlement expenses the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs personnel costs consist of wages benefits bonuses and with respect to sales and marketing expenses sales commissions personnel costs also include stockbased compensation and travel expenses we 

expect operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as we continue to invest in the growth of our business 



research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs prototype expenses thirdparty engineering and contractor support costs and an allocated portion of facility and it costs including depreciation our research and development efforts are focused on maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products and on new product development including new releases and upgrades to our eos software and applications we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership 

research and development expenses increased 203 million  or 46  for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018  the increase was primarily due to a 172 million increase in personnel costs driven primarily by headcount growth and a 78 million increase in in developmentrelated facilities costs due to facilities expansion and headcount growth partially offset by a 59 million decrease in new product introduction costs including thirdparty engineering and other product development costs 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs marketing trade shows and other promotional activities and an allocated portion of facility and it costs including depreciation we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide 

sales and marketing expenses increased 268 million  or 143 for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018  the increase primarily included a 234 million increase in personnel costs which was driven by increased headcount as well as higher sales volumes resulting in increased compensation costs including commissions and stockbased compensation 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and professional services fees including cisco and optumsoft litigationrelated expenses general and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive finance human resources and legal functions our professional services fees are primarily related to external legal accounting and tax services 

general and administrative expenses decreased 35 million  or 54  for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to 2018  the decrease was primarily related to a reduced level of litigation activities as a result of the settlement of our litigation with cisco in august 2018 

legal settlement 

during the three months ended june 30 2018 we recorded 4050 million in legal settlement expenses in connection with the term sheet that was entered into on august 6 2018 between the company and cisco which included a 4000 million payment and 50 million of legal fees associated with the settlement pursuant to the term sheet the company and cisco obtained dismissals of all then ongoing district court and usitc litigation between us on december 3 2018 the parties entered into a mutual release and settlement agreement which superseded the term sheet but did not substantially alter the terms 

other income expense net in thousands except percentages 

other income expense consists primarily of interest income from our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities gains and losses on our investments in privatelyheld companies and foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon adoption of accounting standard codification topic 842  leases “asc 842” on january 1 2019 we derecognized the finance lease obligation associated with our buildtosuit lease and therefore will not incur further interest expense as it relates to this obligation see note 1 organization and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion we expect other income expense net may fluctuate in the future as a result of the remeasurement of our private company equity investments upon the occurrence of observable price change andor impairments changes in interest rates or returns on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 



the favorable change in other income expense net during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to 2018 was driven by a 195 million increase in interest income as we continued to generate cash and expand our marketable securities portfolios and a 192 million favorable change on our investments in privatelyheld companies resulting from the gain on certain investments of 54 million in 2019 compared to a net loss of 138 million on these investments during 2018  see note 5 investments of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

provision for benefit from income taxes in thousands except percentages 

we operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to local country income tax and may also be subject to us income tax generally our us tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these foreign earnings which avoids double taxation our tax expense to date consists of federal state and foreign current and deferred income taxes 



for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  we recorded an expense of 24 million and a benefit of 393 million for income taxes respectively the change in our income taxes was largely attributable to a 969 million tax benefit on the cisco settlement in 2018 and an overall increase in worldwide earnings in 2019 partially offset by a net tax benefit of 86 million resulting from an intraentity transaction to sell our nonamericas economic and beneficial intellectual property rights for further information regarding income taxes and the impact on our results of operations and financial position see note 10 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes our marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highlyrated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss we plan to continue to invest for longterm growth we believe that our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities the timing and cost of establishing 

additional sales and marketing capabilities the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings our costs associated with supply chain activities including access to outsourced manufacturing our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies the continued market acceptance of our products and stock repurchases if we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected

due to decreased deposits at our contract manufacturers and 175 million from an increase in other long term liabilities primarily driven by increased customer prepayments under cancellable contracts these favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable changes of 779 million from increased accounts receivable due to increased billing and timing of customer shipments and 148 million from decreased accrued liabilities due primarily to a decline in supplier liabilities and the timing of vendor accruals

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2019  we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity our contractual obligations represent material expected or contractually committed future payment obligations we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing balances of cash cash equivalent and marketable securities 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2019 in thousands 



the contractual obligation table above excludes tax liabilities of 575 million related to uncertain tax positions because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement if any of these future payments 

in connection with tax reform as of december 31 2017 we recorded a federal income tax payable for transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings that will be payable over an eightyear period the amounts included in the table above represent the remaining federal income tax payable after applying the first year’s installment payment and early payments of future installments 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods we base our estimates assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements which in turn could change the results from those reported we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected the critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are the following 

revenue recognition   

we generate revenue from sales of our products which incorporate our eos software and accessories such as cables and optics to direct customers and channel partners together with pcs we typically sell products and pcs in a single contract we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services we apply the following fivestep revenue recognition model 



 postcontract customer support 

pcs which includes technical support hardware repair and replacement parts beyond standard warranty bug fixes patches and unspecified upgrades on a whenandifavailable basis is offered under renewable feebased contracts we initially defer pcs revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the pcs contract as there is no discernable pattern of delivery related to these promises we do not provide unspecified upgrades on a set schedule and addresses customer requests for technical support if and when they arise with the related expenses recognized as incurred pcs contracts generally have a term of one to three years we include billed but unearned pcs revenue in deferred revenue 

contracts with multiple performance obligations 

most of our contracts with customers other than renewals of pcs contain multiple performance obligations with a combination of products and pcs products and pcs generally qualify as distinct performance obligations our hardware includes eos software which together deliver the essential functionality of our products for contracts which contain multiple performance obligations we allocate revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on the standalone selling price “ssp” judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp for products and pcs sold together in a contract to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and pcs 

if we do not have an observable ssp such as when we do not sell a product or service separately then ssp is estimated using judgment and considering all reasonably available information such as market conditions and information about the size andor purchase volume of the customer we generally use a range of amounts to estimate ssp for individual products and services based on multiple factors including but not limited to the sales channel reseller distributor or end customer the geographies in which our products and services are sold and the size of the end customer 

we limit the amount of revenue recognition for contracts containing forms of variable consideration such as future performance obligations customerspecific returns and acceptance or refund obligations we include some or all of an estimate of the related at risk consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recorded under each contract will not occur when the uncertainties surrounding the variable consideration are resolved 

most of our contracts with customers have payment terms of 30 days with some large high volume customers having terms of up to 60 days we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component because the company and the customer have specific business reasons other than financing for entering into such contracts specifically both we and our customers seek to ensure the customer has a simplified way of purchasing arista products and services 

we account for multiple contracts with a single partner as one arrangement if the contractual terms andor substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are in effect parts of a single contract 

we may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is generally no contractual provision for such returns we estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied against currentperiod shipments specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate 

our policy applies to the accounting for individual contracts however we have elected a practical expedient to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts or performance obligations with similar characteristics so long as such application would not differ materially from applying the guidance to the individual contracts or performance obligations within that portfolio consequently we have chosen to apply the portfolio approach when possible which we do not believe will happen frequently additionally we will evaluate a portfolio of data when possible in various situations including accounting for commissions rights of return and transactions with variable consideration 

we report revenue net of sales taxes we include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 

inventory valuation and contract manufacturersupplier liabilities 

inventories primarily consist of finished goods and strategic components primarily integrated circuits inventories are stated at the lower of cost computed using the firstin firstout method and net realizable value manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory we record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value 

our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts we record a liability and a corresponding charge for noncancellable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers or suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes   

we use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures these estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers product development plans and current sales levels if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities 

income taxes 

income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that we recognize for financial reporting and income tax purposes 

we account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements but have not been reflected in our taxable income estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize 

we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

we regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether and to the extent to which additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense 

loss contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are a party to claims and legal proceedings including matters relating to commercial employee relations business practices and intellectual property in assessing loss contingencies we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss impairment of an asset or the 

incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss we record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we will record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and investments in privately held companies 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars and therefore our revenue is not directly subject to foreign currency risk however we are indirectly exposed to foreign currency risk a stronger us dollar could make our products and services more expensive in foreign countries and therefore reduce demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect such economic exposure to currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are also influenced by many other factors 

our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located which is primarily in the us and to a lesser extent in europe and asia our results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates on our monetary assets and liabilities would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations to date foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date and do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

interest rate sensitivity 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  we had cash cash equivalents and availableforsale marketable securities totaling 27 billion and 20 billion  respectively cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in money market funds corporate bonds us agency mortgagebacked securities us treasury securities and commercial paper our primary investment objectives are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements in addition our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issuer we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the us a decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income on our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities for the year ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in overall interest rates would not have had a material impact on our interest income 

on the other hand the fair market value of our investments in fixed income securities may be adversely impacted we would incur unrealized losses on fixed income securities primarily due to higher interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase under certain circumstances if we are forced to sell our marketable 

securities prior to maturity we may incur realized losses in such investments however because of the conservative and shortterm nature of the investments in our portfolio a change in interest rates is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

investments in privatelyheld companies 

our nonmarketable equity investments in privatelyheld companies are recorded in “investments” in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the total carrying amount of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 42 million and 303 million  during fiscal 2019 we recorded a net gain of 54 million on certain investments compared to a net loss of 138m during fiscal 2018 see note 5 investments of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for details 

the privatelyheld companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privatelyheld companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

management with the participation of our chief executive officer “ceo” and our chief financial officer “cfo” evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2019  the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2019  our ceo and cfo concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting   

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by rule 13a15d and 15d15d of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended that occurred during the year ended december 31 2019 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

in connection with our adoption of asc 842 the new lease accounting standard on january 1 2019 we implemented internal controls to ensure we adequately evaluated our contracts and properly assessed the impact of asc 842 on our financial statements and disclosures 

inherent limitations of internal controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls 

the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019  based on the framework set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control  integrated framework 2013 framework based on that assessment management concluded that as of december 31 2019  our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019  has been audited by ernst  young llp the independent registered public accounting firm that audits our consolidated financial statements as stated in their report included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019

 item 1 business 

we are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration data centers and campuses for enterprise support our cloud networking solutions consist of our extensible operating system or eos a set of network applications and our ethernet switching and routing platforms our cloud networking solutions deliver industryleading performance scalability availability programmability automation and visibility at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was purposebuilt to be fully programmable and highly modular the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services since we began shipping our products we have grown rapidly and according to crehan research we have achieved the second largest market share in data center 10254050100 gigabit ethernet switch ports excluding blade switching sold in 2018 we have been profitable and cash flow positive for each year since 2010 

eos supports leading cloud and virtualization solutions including vmware nsx microsoft system center openstack and other cloud management frameworks we have worked with industry leaders to define new open protocols for the virtualized data center we coauthored the vxlan protocol specification with vmware and were the first to demonstrate vxlan integration and have now expanded vxlan routing and integration 

we use standard linux as our underlying operating system providing customers with access to all linux operating system facilities this allows customers to extend our eos software with offtheshelf linux applications and a growing number of open source management tools 

eos has a highly modular architecture which allows us to prevent network outages in deployments of our cloud networking solutions this architecture also allows us to rapidly develop new features and protocols without compromising the quality of the existing code base because all of our platform products are powered by the same binary image of eos we are able to deliver these new innovations to our entire installed base with minimal disruption 

eos a software platform for network programmability and automation provides an advanced level of programmability allowing customers to take advantage of prebuilt and custom eos applications as well as integration with a wide range of technology partner solutions 

in 2015 we introduced cloudvision a networkwide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation delivering a turnkey solution for cloud networking we believe cloudvision’s abstraction of the physical network to this broader networkwide perspective allows for a more efficient approach for several operational usecases related to automation visibility management security and 3 rd  party controller integration 

in 2018 we announced a new network architecture designed to address transitional changes as the enterprise moves to an internet of things “iot”ready campus leveraging eos® and cloudvision® our cognitive cloud networking approach brings operational consistency and modern cloud principles to the enterprise campus as part of the enterprise campus solution we acquired mojo networks inc “mojo” inventor of cognitive wifi tm and a leader in cloudmanaged wireless networking we also acquired metamako holding pty ltd “metamako” a leader in lowlatency fpgaenabled network solutions 

we sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others our customers include six of the largest cloud services providers based on annual revenue 

industry background 

cloud computing is fundamentally changing the way it infrastructure is built and how applications are delivered in cloud computing applications are distributed across thousands of servers these servers are connected 

with highspeed network switches that together form a pool of resources that allows applications to be rapidly deployed and costeffectively updated cloud computing enables ubiquitous and ondemand network access to these applications from internetconnected devices including personal computers tablets and smartphones 

nearly all consumer applications today are delivered as cloud services enterprise applications are rapidly moving to the cloud as well since cloud services are easier and more cost effective to deploy scale and operate than traditional applications internet leaders like amazon ebay facebook google microsoft and yahoo pioneered the development of largescale cloud data centers in order to meet the growing demands of their users including business customers enterprises and service providers around the world are adopting cloud computing technologies in order to achieve similar performance improvements and cost reductions 

the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can be orders of magnitude higher than typical legacy data center networks therefore the networks in such cloud environments must be architected and built in a new way we refer to these nextgeneration data center networks as cloud networks cloud networks must deliver high capacity high availability and predictable performance and must be programmable to allow integration with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services 

limitations of traditional data center networks 

in our view cloud networks and legacy networks are fundamentally different in a traditional data center specific applications are installed on a small number of servers and most network traffic is servertoclient or “northsouth” traffic which results in perhaps a few terabitssecond of aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud most network traffic is servertoserver or “eastwest” traffic the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can exceed 1 petabitsecond orders of magnitude higher than that of typical legacy data center networks 

the much larger scale of cloud networks requires much higher network availability since network outages in the cloud are very expensive in terms of customer impact traditional network switches have evolved and the features and capabilities of their operating system have expanded over many years without addressing the structural deficiencies of their underlying software architectures making it difficult to achieve high network switch reliability 

some networking vendors have built products that use proprietary protocols to address the scaling needs of nextgeneration data centers however proprietary protocols are generally not acceptable to internet companies or cloud service providers because they create vendor lockin 

legacy networks are not programmable and as a result are extremely difficult to integrate with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services this lack of integration forces customers to continue to rely on time consuming errorprone manual processes that may be costprohibitive 

limitations of traditional enterprise campus networks 

traditional enterprise campus networks suffer from complex bottlenecks brought on by the myriad of platforms operating systems proprietary features and network management tools coupled with the explosive growth of iot and endpoints as well as the requirement for workloads users and devices to be connected anywhere the operational costs of managing these complexities become prohibitive 

arista cloudvision built on the cognitive management plane cmp engine is a proven and powerful platform for turnkey orchestration provisioning and telemetry born initially in the data center era cloudvision now extends the same common operational model to the campus providing unified wired wireless and data center management 

today’s wired and wireless campus networks must cope with everincreasing endpoint devices necessitating the understanding of endpoint behavior cloudvision’s latest feature device analyzer provides inventory and deep flow analysis of all connected devices campus administrators can access device type connectivity method location and communication patterns this visibility enables an administrator to identify unauthorized traffic and compromised endpoints since cloudvision spans the data center and the campus customers can leverage a single platform for endtoend troubleshooting 

requirements for cloud networking 

cloud networks differ in many aspects from legacy networks including capacity performance scale availability programmability automation visibility security and cost performance the requirements for cloud networking include the following 

 our cloud networking solutions 

we are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration enterprise data centers and campuses our cloud networking platform was purposebuilt to address the functional and performance requirements for cloud networks we deliver our solutions via our industryleading 10254050100 gigabit ethernet switches and routers optimized for nextgeneration data center networks 

our cloud networking solutions consist of eos our extensible operating system a set of networking applications and our gigabit ethernet platforms at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was architected to be fully programmable and highly modular 

the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications and application programming interfaces or apis that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has further allowed us to integrate rapidly with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services 

the key benefits of our cloud networking solutions are as follows 

capacity performance and scalability 

our cloud networking platform enables data center networks to scale to hundreds of thousands of physical servers and millions of virtual machines with the least number of switching tiers we achieve this by leveraging standard protocols to meet the scale requirements of cloud computing we have used activeactive layer 2 and layer 3 network topologies to enable customers to build extremely large and resilient networks 

high availability 

our highly modular eos software architecture was designed to be faultisolating and selfhealing in order to deliver higher stability compared to legacy network operating systems in addition our customers can nondisruptively upgrade our switches running in the network using our smart system upgrade or ssu application 

open and programmable 

our eos software was purposebuilt to offer programmable interfaces throughout all levels of our software this has allowed us to integrate our cloud networking platform with a wide range of leading thirdparty applications for example we support vmware nsx openstack and microsoft system center for orchestration and fast provisioning enabling true workload mobility and automatic provisioning of physical switches we enable customers through application programming interfaces to write their own scripts to customize and optimize their networks in addition we support a wide range of softwaredefined network controllers via our openflow and directflow interfaces 

workflow automation 

our eos software enables enterprises to provision networking resources in minutes with no manual intervention through our zero touch provisioning we also natively support ansible cfengine chef puppet virtual network orchestration applications and thirdparty management tools cloudvision a networkwide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation delivers a turnkey solution for cloud networking cloudvision extends the same eos architectural approach across the network for state topology monitoring and visibility this enables enterprises to move to cloudclass automation without needing significant internal development finally eos embraces the devops model which is a software development method that combines development and operations to provision and monitor servers storage and network resources in a unified fashion 

network visibility 

our eos software provides a set of tools and applications that proactively monitor detect and notify network managers when network issues arise delivering realtime data to thirdparty management applications including corvil extrahop riverbed and splunk to provide detailed application visibility our telemetry applications include vm tracer which provides visibility down to the virtual machine level path tracer which detects errors in provisioned network paths mapreduce tracer which monitors and optimizes the performance of hadoop workloads and health tracer which monitors infrastructure resiliency our network visibility applications provide realtime insight into the status of the network they include lanz which monitors latency and danz 2017 a set of features previously only available in addon network visibility devices which provides advanced traffic monitoring with flow analysis and timestamps plus the ability to perform tap aggregation for reporting and analysis 

security 

macrosegmentation services mss™ is one of the services enabled via cloudvision since cloudvision maintains a networkwide database of all state within the network as well as direct integration with hypervisor resources like vmware vsphere and nsx it is aware of every workload that is within the network and it learns in real time about new devices or workloads that are added or removed from the network or moved across ports or servers macrosegmentation extends the concept of finegrained interhypervisor security to cloud networks by enabling dynamic security and services for physical to virtual workloads macrosegmentation security is a complement to finegrained security delivered via microsegmentation that is already implemented in the virtual switch of the physical host on which a vm is running 

lower total cost of ownership 

our cloud networking platform offers architectural and system advantages that provide our customers with costeffective and highly available cloud networking solutions our programmable scalable leafspine architectures combined with industryleading applications significantly reduce networking costs when compared to legacy network designs enabling faster time to service and improved availability our automation tools reduce the operational costs of provisioning managing and monitoring a data center network and speed up service delivery our visibility tools provide high levels of visibility into complex network environments without the need for additional data collection equipment as a result fewer network engineers are needed to operate large networks 

our market opportunity 

we compete primarily in the data center switching market for 10 gigabit ethernet and above excluding blade switches we also compete in the enterprise campus market for 1 gigabit ethernet switching and above and cloudmanaged wireless networking 

we believe that cloud computing represents a fundamental shift from traditional legacy data centers and that cloud networking is the fastest growing segment within the data center switching market as organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud architectures spending on cloud and nextgeneration data centers has increased rapidly over the last several years while traditional legacy it spending has been growing more slowly our 7150 7050 7250 7300 and 7500 series platforms are now listed on the u s department of defense approved products lists integrated tracking system by the defense information systems agency 

our customers 

as of december 31 2018  we had delivered our cloud networking solutions to over 5500  end customers worldwide in approximately 86  countries our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others for each of the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  microsoft purchases through our channel partner world wide technology inc accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue 

our competitive strengths 

we believe the following strengths will allow us to maintain and extend our technology leadership position in cloud networking and nextgeneration data center ethernet products 



 our products and technology 

we offer one of the broadest product lines of data center 10254050100 gigabit ethernet switches and routers in the industry comprising our 70107020 series 7050x series 7060x series 7130 series 7160 series 7150 series 7170 series 7250x series 7260 series 7280r series universal leaf products 7300x series spline products and our 7500r series universal spine products 

we deliver routing and switching platforms with industryleading capacity low latency port density and power efficiency we have also innovated in areas such as deep packet buffers embedded optics and reversible cooling an overview of our switchingrouting portfolio is shown in the figure below 

we use multiple silicon architectures across our products which allows us to build a broader range of products optimized for different functions in the network than competitors that utilize fewer silicon architectures while we use multiple silicon architectures all of our platforms are powered with the same binary eos image which significantly simplifies deployment and ensures the same rich feature set and consistent operation across all our products 

our extensible operating system 

the core of our cloud networking platform is our extensible operating system or eos which runs on top of standard linux and offers programmability at all layers of the stack all of our 10254050100 gigabit ethernet platforms run our eos software 

eos is based on a new and innovative architecture that is highly modular and consists of more than 100 separate processes that we call agents each one handling specific protocol processing device driver or system management functions each agent runs in user space as a separate linux process and is completely protected and isolated from all other agents 

we are constantly investing in our core infrastructure to provide the capabilities required for building modern cloud networks and enhancing scalability new requirements for use in cloud and service provider networks and hybrid cloud deployments in enterprises require ongoing upgrades and extensions to our state oriented architecture 

eos attributes 

the modular and programmable architecture of eos enables us to offer a set of attributes capabilities and features that are essential for cloud networking and nextgeneration data centers 

high availability 

eos is selfhealing in the sense that individual processes can be restarted without impacting application traffic this architectural design principle supports selfhealing resiliency in our software easier software maintenance and module independence higher software quality overall and faster timetomarket for new features that customers require 

programmable at all layers 

eos is programmable at all layers from the linux kernel to switch configuration provisioning automation and detailed monitoring of the network public cloud providers have leveraged tools such as the eos software development kit “sdk” and eapi to implement fully customized infrastructure automation solutions 

workflow visibility 

through eos we have developed a wide range of applications available to our customers for purchase as additional licenses that enable enhanced network monitoring and visibility without requiring additional external monitoring devices this includes i dataanalyzer danz which provides access to raw network data for analysis by security troubleshooting and performance management tools ii latencyloss analyzer lanz which provides access to internal network performance loads and packet loss and latency occurring at the microsecond level iii network telemetry which provides network state information including correlations with dynamic state of the systems operating on the network such as hypervisors distributed job controls and iv network tracers which provide active integration and diagnostics for various workload conditions dependent upon network performance 

network automation 

eos supports puppet chef and ansible which enables automatic network configuration in the same manner as servers and storage in addition eos provides tools that greatly reduce network operational costs another major component of network automation is cloud vision 

cloudvision 

cloudvision’s abstraction of the physical network to a broader networkwide perspective allows for a more efficient approach for several operational usecases including the following highlights 

 containerized eos 

arista ceos™ is a containerized packaging of eos software and its agents for deployment in cloud infrastructure with the same proven eos software image that runs on all of our products these flexible deployment options empower cloud network operators that are customizing their operating environments to provide a uniform workflow for development testing and deployment of differentiated services it enables the provisioning of a robust and proven network operating system across production and development platforms with a uniform eos 

distribution and singleimage consistency our customers can also utilize ceos in tandem with industry standard white box hardware and enable a wide array of tools and applications from the container ecosystem 

arista veos router 

the arista veos router is a core component of arista any cloud platform the veos router is our same proven single eos software image offered as a multicloud and multihypervisor virtual router this cloudgrade and featurerich software platform empowers enterprises and service providers to build consistent highly secure and scalable cloud networks the arista veos router is designed to support any public or hybrid cloud environment including amazon web services “aws” microsoft azure cloud microsoft azure stack google cloud platform and oracle cloud infrastructure 

leafspine network designs 

our customers typically deploy leafspine network topologies consisting of leaf switches or topofrack switches located in the server rack connected with uplinks to multiple loadsharing spine switches and routers that provide the backbone our leafspine network designs scale up to more than 300000 physical servers and millions of virtual machines using equal cost multiple path or ecmp to load balance layer 3 network traffic across multiple spine switches and routers with multichassis link aggregation or mlag we can build an activeactive layer 2 network that can connect more than 25000 physical servers our leafspine network designs have been widely deployed and provide predictable network bandwidth and latency a key advantage of predictable network performance is that it eliminates the need to optimize the network for specific applications which means a single network design works equally well for all applications 

enterprise resources commonly span multiple data centers or performance optimized datacenters “pods” within a data center including the public cloud the drive to deliver resources quickly affordably and reliably also drives the need for a flexible costeffective scaleout design at the data center core which we refer to as the “spine of spines” or universal spine the universal spine is nonblocking supports large scale ecmp ip routing and routing convergence the universal spine enables architects to build the network around the spine and collapse legacy networking layers into the universal spine

cloud principles migrate enterprise from pins to pics 

with the arista any cloud solution enterprise customers can now deploy a reliable and secure multicloud experience with a common universal cloud network approach across all of the placesinthecloud “pics” as opposed to siloed placesinthenetwork “pins” of the legacy enterprise this enables it organizations to harness dispersed cloud resources anywhere for better availability of services and applications across any cloud any workload and any location 

cognitive wifi 

with the acquisition of mojo we now integrate the wireless edge via the cloudvision platform the cognitive wifi architecture is tailored to enable an arista access point portfolio in a controllerless wireless network these access point “ap” solutions are available in disaggregated options harnessing the power of cloud machine learning and cognitive computing to deliver great experiences to wifi users our cognitive wifi delivers massive scalability and a linear payasyougo pricing model providing a predictable total cost of ownership path cloudvision wifi is based on a similar cmp model for cognitive analytics unifying the operational experience across wired and wireless cloudvision wifi enhances realtime insight into the experience of wifi clients to connect and utilize the network client journey is a set of dashboards that help operators diagnose client connectivity track availability of network services and identify the root cause of wifi issues with live and historical telemetry data for the proactive assessment of client to application performance 

arista cognitive campus includes a suite of wifi tracer tools for wireless security reachability and network health diagnostics the integrated wireless intrusion protection system “wips” protects networks against rogue aps honeypots and implements device classification to determine authorized client devices connecting to unauthorized aps additional wips scanning is accomplished via a dedicated third radio which can also perform various network performance and health diagnostics the ap can simulate a client device—association and authentication instrumenting identity and access aaa and dhcpdns latencies connectivity to the upstream network and voice calls to calculate mos score and network throughput these automated tests can be prescheduled without administrator intervention ensuring business ready wifi cloudvision wifi applications fuses arista access points with cloud networking spines and splines for a seamless topology view 

cognitive cloud networking for the campus 

our cognitive cloud networking for the campus is based on three principles 

universal cloud network   offered as an alternative to brittle proprietary solutions from legacy vendors our universal cloud network is an open standardsbased design focusing on softwaredriven control principles our collapsed spline™ approach consolidates traditional campus core and aggregation layers into a simple single tier with high availability 

cognitive management plane   there is a dire void in management plane consistency and a need for datadriven analytics in the campus as in the data center we believe that a common model can be applied across both saving 

customers operational costs the cognitive management plane based on arista cloudvision is a datadriven repository for the automated actions across network analytics 

securing the campus   securing the campus spline requires a holistic approach to network segmentation device compliance and auditing as well as service integration with our security partners we deliver these capabilities through eos and cloudvision 

examples of our cognitive cloud networking architectures are illustrated below 

customer support and services 

we have designed our customer support offerings to provide our customers with high levels of support our global team of support engineers engages directly with client it teams and is available at all times over email by phone or through our website 

we offer multiple service options that allow our customers to select the product replacement service level that best meets their needs we stock spare parts in over 125 locations around the world through our thirdparty logistics suppliers all of our service options include unlimited access to bugfixes new featurereleases online case management and our community forums 

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our products through our direct sales force and in partnership with our channel partners including distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators and oem partners we also sell in conjunction with various technology partners to facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity we have created a partner program the arista partner program to engage partners who provide valueadded services and extend our reach into the marketplace authorized training partners perform technical training of our channel partners and end customers our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us 

our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for presales technical support and solutions engineering for our end customers systems integrators original equipment manufacturers or oems and channel partners a pool of shared channel sales and marketing representatives also supports these teams each sales team is responsible for a geographical territory has responsibility for a number of major direct endcustomer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market we have field sales teams operating in approximately 86  countries 

our marketing activities consist primarily of technology conferences web marketing trade shows product demonstrations seminars and events public relations analyst relations demand generation and direct marketing to build our brand increase endcustomer awareness communicate our product advantages and generate qualified leads for our field sales force and channel partners 

research and development 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and features that address the needs of our end customers our inhouse engineering personnel are responsible for the development quality documentation support and release of our products we plan to continue to invest significantly in resources to conduct our research and development efforts 

manufacturing 

we subcontract the manufacturing of all of our products to various contract manufacturers our primary manufacturing partners are jabil circuit sanmina corporation and foxconn this approach allows us to reduce our costs manufacturing overhead and inventory position and allows us to adjust more quickly to changing endcustomer demand we require all of our manufacturing locations to be iso9001 certified our eos software is installed on our products at one of three direct fulfillment facilities 

our contract manufacturing partners procure the majority of the components needed to build our products and assemble our products according to our design specifications this allows us to leverage the purchasing power of our contract manufacturing partners we retain complete control over the bill of material test procedures and quality assurance programs our onsite personnel work closely with our partners and review on an ongoing basis forecasts inventory levels processes capacity yields and overall quality our contract manufacturing partners procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts these forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analyses from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions we update these forecasts monthly 

our products rely on key components including merchant silicon integrated circuit components and power supplies purchased from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers generally neither our contract manufacturers nor we have a written agreement with these component providers to guarantee the supply of the key components used in our products nor do we have exclusive rights to such key components our product development efforts also depend upon continued collaboration with our key suppliers including our merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors it is critical that we work in tandem with our key merchant silicon vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features this enables us to focus our research and development resources on software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions 

once the completed products are manufactured and tested our contract manufacturing partners ship them to various theatre direct fulfillment facilities in the united states the netherlands and singapore for final configuration quality control inspection and shipment to our distribution partners and end customers after the products are shipped to our end customers our products are installed by the end customers or by thirdparty service providers such as system integrators or value added resellers on their behalf 

backlog 

we do not have any longterm purchase commitments from customers customers generally order products on an asneeded basis with short lead and delivery times on a perpurchaseorder basis we maintain sufficient finished goods inventory to ensure that products can generally be shipped shortly after receipt of an order a significant portion of our customer shipments in any fiscal year relate to orders received and shipped in that fiscal year our customers utilize purchase orders containing nonbinding purchase commitments and we allow customers to cancel change or reschedule orders without penalty at any time prior to shipment and as a result we do not believe backlog is firm due to the foregoing factors backlog is not a meaningful indicator in any given period of our ability to achieve any particular level of overall revenue or financial performance 

competition 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology changing endcustomer needs evolving industry standards frequent introductions of new products and services and industry consolidation we expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for cloud networking expands and existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products 

the data center and campus networking markets have been historically dominated by cisco systems “cisco” with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including extreme networks dellemc hewlett packard enterprise juniper networks and mist systems most of our competitors and some strategic alliance partners have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example in the last few years alone  broadcom acquired brocade communications systems extreme networks purchased certain data center networking assets from broadcombrocade and avaya dell acquired force10 and emc ibm acquired blade network technology hewlett packard enterprise acquired aruba networks juniper networks acquired contrail systems and cisco acquired insieme networks  we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants including “whitebox” switch vendors as well as current technology partners and end customers who may acquire or develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products to market and sell to customers furthermore our relationships with our strategic alliance partners may shift as industry dynamics changes if strategic alliance partners acquire or develop competitive products or services our relationship with those partners may be adversely impacted which could lead to more variability to our results of operations and impact the pricing of our solutions 

the principal competitive factors applicable to our products include 

 we believe our products compete favorably with respect to these factors our eos software offers high reliability integrates with existing network protocols and is open and programmable we believe the combination of eos a set of network applications and our 10254050100 gigabit ethernet platforms make our offering highly competitive for both cloud and enterprise data centers however many of our competitors have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger sales and marketing budgets and resources broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and end customers greater access to larger endcustomer bases greater endcustomer support resources greater manufacturing resources the ability to leverage their sales efforts across a broader portfolio of products the ability to leverage purchasing power when purchasing subcomponents the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services the ability to develop their own silicon chips the ability to set more aggressive pricing policies lower labor and development costs greater resources to make acquisitions larger intellectual property portfolios and substantially greater financial technical research and development or other resources 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our core technology and intellectual property we rely on patent trademark and copyright laws trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees end customers resellers systems integrators and others to protect our intellectual property rights we 

file us and foreign patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 

we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of valuable breadth or applicability in addition any patents that may be issued may be contested circumvented found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them we also license software from third parties for integration into our products including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms we also own a number of trademarks in the us and other jurisdictions including arista eos cloudvision cloudstream cvp cvx health tracer mapreduce tracer path tracer mxp mss rail score spline superspine ssu flexroute netrollback netdb osfp algomatch macrosegmentation and macrosegmentation service 

we control access to and use of our software technology and other proprietary information through internal and external controls including contractual protections with employees contractors end customers and partners our software is protected by us and international copyright patent and trade secret laws despite our efforts to protect our software technology and other proprietary information unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software technology and other proprietary information in addition we intend to expand our international operations and effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights if we become more successful we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights it may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights in particular large and established companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation from time to time third parties including certain of these large companies and nonpracticing entities may assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our end customers whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against such claims please see “legal proceedings” included in part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of this litigation 

furthermore in order to comply with the united states international trade commission “usitc” exclusion and cease and desist orders previously issued in relation to the cisco legal matter we made certain design changes to our products for sale in the united states see note 7 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k  for details following the expiration and invalidation of related patent claims effective july 1 2018 certain features previously covered by the orders could be reincorporated into our products we are working with customers to complete any remaining requalification procedures related to the reintroduction of these features the timing of which could result in an impact to our revenue and our deferred revenue balances 

successful claims of infringement by a third party if any could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services require us to expend time and money to develop noninfringing solutions or force us to pay substantial damages royalties or other fees we cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe or that we will not in the future infringe upon any thirdparty patents or other proprietary rights

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k which could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the risks described below are not the only risks facing us risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

risks related to our business and our industry 

our business and operations have experienced rapid growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected 

we have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last several years which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure our employee headcount and number of end customers have increased and we expect both to continue to grow over the next year for example between december 31 2015  and december 31 2018  our headcount grew from approximately 1200  employees to approximately 2300  employees and our cumulative number of end customers grew from approximately 3700  to over 5500  as we have grown we have had to manage an increasingly large and more complex array of internal systems and processes to scale with all aspects of our business including our hardware and software development contract manufacturing purchasing logistics fulfillment and maintenance and support our success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and continue to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems we may not be able to successfully implement these or other improvements to our systems and processes in an efficient or timely manner and we may discover deficiencies in their capabilities or effectiveness we may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems and processes or in connection with thirdparty technology in addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate effectively and in the intended manner may result in disruption of our current operations and endcustomer relationships our inability to manage the growth of our business and our inability to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings and prevent certain losses 

the cloud networking market is rapidly evolving if this market does not evolve as we anticipate or our target end customers do not adopt our cloud networking solutions we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the growth and evolution of the cloud networking market the market demand for cloud networking solutions has increased in recent years as end customers have deployed larger more sophisticated networks and have increased the use of virtualization and cloud computing the continued growth of this market will be dependent upon many factors including but not limited to the adoption of and demand for our end customers’ products and services the expansion evolution and build out of our end customers’ networks the capacity utilization of existing network infrastructures changes in the technological requirements for the products and services to be deployed in these networks the amount and mix of capital spending by our end customers the development of network switches and cloud service solutions by our large end customers for internal use the financial performance and prospects of our end customers the availability of capital resources to our end customers changes in government regulation that could impact cloud networking business models including those regulations related to cyber security privacy data protection and net neutrality our ability to provide cloud networking solutions that address the needs of end customers more effectively and economically than those of other competitors or existing technologies and general economic conditions 

if the cloud networking solutions market does not develop in the way we anticipate or otherwise experiences a slowdown if our solutions do not offer benefits compared to competing networking products or if end customers do not recognize the benefits that our solutions provide then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and may increase the risk associated with your investment 

we shipped our first products in 2008 and the majority of our revenue growth has occurred since the beginning of 2010 our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects including our ability to plan for and model future growth we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries including the risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k if we do not address these risks successfully our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline further we have limited historical financial data and we operate in a rapidly evolving market as such any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market 

we pursue new product offerings and technology initiatives from time to time and if we fail to successfully carry out these initiatives our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted 

as part of the evolution of our business we have made substantial investments to develop new products and enhancements to existing products through our acquisitions and research and development efforts if we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and costeffective manner or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand we may lose our competitive position our products may become obsolete and our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

additionally from time to time we invest in expansion into adjacent markets including the campus switching and wifi networking markets although we believe these solutions are complementary to our current offerings we have less experience and a more limited operating history in these markets and our efforts in this area may not be successful expanding our services in existing and new markets and increasing the depth and breadth of our presence imposes significant burdens on our marketing compliance and other administrative and managerial resources our plan to expand and deepen our market share in our existing markets and possibly expand into additional markets is subject to a variety of risks and challenges our success in these new markets depends on a variety of factors including the following 



 additionally future market share gains may take longer than planned and cause us to incur significant costs difficulties in any of our new product development efforts or our efforts to enter adjacent markets could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

we must continue to enhance our existing products and develop new technologies and products that address emerging technological trends evolving industry standards and changing endcustomer needs the process of enhancing our existing products and developing new technology is complex and uncertain and new offerings requires significant upfront investment that may not result in material design improvements to existing products or result in marketable new products or costs savings or revenue for an extended period of time if at all 

in addition new technologies could render our existing products obsolete or less attractive to end customers and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if such technologies are widely adopted for example end customers may prefer to address their network switch requirements by licensing software operating systems separately and placing them on industrystandard servers or develop their own networking products rather than purchasing integrated hardware products as has occurred in the server industry 

in the past several years we have announced a number of new products and enhancements to our products and services the success of our new products depends on several factors including but not limited to appropriate new product definition the development of product features that sufficiently meet enduser requirements component costs timely completion and introduction of these products prompt solution of any defects or bugs in these products our ability to support these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 

our product releases introduced new software products that include the capability for disaggregation of our software operating systems from our hardware the success of our strategy to expand our software business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the additional development efforts and costs to create these new products or make them compatible with other technologies the potential for our strategy to negatively impact revenues and gross margins and additional costs associated with regulatory compliance 

we may not be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology or endcustomer requirements on a timely basis or at all if we fail to keep up with technology changes or to convince our end customers and potential end customers of the value of our solutions even in light of new technologies we may lose customers decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and services and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

to remain competitive we must successfully manage product introductions and transitions 

our ability to continue to compete effectively in a rapidly evolving market requires that we successfully release new products that meet the increasingly sophisticated networking requirements of our end customers the success of new product introductions will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance of our new products our ability to penetrate new markets our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the timely development and availability of new merchant silicon chips from our suppliers the effective management of purchase commitments 

and inventory in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction for example our new product releases will require strong execution from our third party merchant silicon chip suppliers to develop and release new merchant silicon chips that satisfy endcustomer requirements to meet expected release schedules and to provide sufficient quantities of these components in addition we recently introduced arista cognitive cloud networking for the campus as well as mojo cognitive wifi and metamako low latency switches if we are unable to successfully manage our product introductions or transitions or if we fail to penetrate new markets as a result of any of these or other factors our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance 

our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance we experienced annual revenue growth rates of 307  458  and 348  in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively in the future we expect our revenue growth rates to decline as the size of our customer base increases we achieve higher market penetration in our current target market and we continue to enter and expand into new target markets other factors may also contribute to declines in our growth rates including changes in demand for our products and services increased competition our ability to successfully manage our expansion or continue to capitalize on growth opportunities the maturation of our business and general economic and international trade conditions you should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected and our stock price could be volatile 

our results of operations are likely to vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors or our previously issued financial guidance or if any forwardlooking financial guidance does not meet the expectation of analysts or investors the market price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our results of operations have historically varied from period to period and we expect that this trend will continue as a result you should not rely upon our past financial results for any period as indicators of future performance our results of operations in any given period can be influenced by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict including 



 any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of several of the factors described above may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other results of operations this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our revenue gross margins results of operations or other expectations contained in any forward looking financial guidance we have issued or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for a particular period if we fail to meet or exceed such guidance or expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our common stock could decline substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits 

if we are unable to attract new large end customers or to sell additional products to our existing end customers our revenue growth will be adversely affected and our revenue could decrease 

to increase our revenue we must add new end customers and large end customers and sell additional products to existing end customers for example one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our solutions thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers we believe this opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing infrastructure and expected future spend another one of our sales strategies is focused on increasing penetration in the enterprise and campus markets enterprise and campus end customers typically start with small purchases and there is often a long testing period if we fail to attract new large end customers including enterprise and campus end customers or fail to reduce the sales cycle and sell additional products to our existing end customers our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

we expect large purchases by a limited number of end customers to continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue and any loss delay decline or other change in expected purchases could result in material quartertoquarter fluctuations of our revenue or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue particularly in the cloud networking market many of these end customers make large purchases to complete or upgrade specific data center installations and are typically made on a purchaseorder basis rather than pursuant to longterm contracts for example revenue from sales to microsoft through our channel partner world wide technology inc accounted for 27  16  and 16  of our revenue for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively our sales to microsoft as an enduser in the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 benefited from certain factors that may not repeat in fiscal 2019 or future years and the percentage of our revenue from microsoft in fiscal 2019 may decline 

as a consequence of the concentrated nature of our customer base and their purchasing behavior our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate changes in the business requirements or focus vendor selection project prioritization financial prospects capital resources and expenditures or purchasing behavior of our key end customers could significantly decrease our sales to such end customers or could lead to delays reductions or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services moreover because our sales will be based primarily on purchase orders our customers may cancel delay reduce or otherwise modify their purchase commitments with little or no notice to us this limited visibility regarding our end customers’ product needs the timing and quantity of which could vary significantly requires us to rely on estimated demand forecasts to determine how much material to purchase and product to manufacture our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages that can impede production by our customers and harm our customer relationships and in the event of a cancellation or reduction of an order we may not have enough time to reduce operating expenses to mitigate the effect of the lost revenue on our business which could materially affect our operating results 

we may be unable to sustain or increase our revenue from our large end customers grow revenues with new or other existing end customers at the rate we anticipate or at all or offset the discontinuation of concentrated purchases by our larger end customers with purchases by new or existing end customers these customers can drive the growth in revenue for particular products and services based on factors such as trends in the networking market business mergers and acquisitions trends in economic conditions and the overall fast growth of a customers underlying business these customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors demand pricing concessions for our services or require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs if these factors drove some of our large customers to cancel all or a portion of their business relationships with us the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and longterm financial forecasts may be materially impacted we expect that such concentrated purchases will continue to contribute materially to our revenue for the foreseeable future and that our results of operations may fluctuate materially as a result of such larger end customers’ buying patterns in addition we may see consolidation of our customer base such as among internet companies and cloud service providers which could result in loss of end customers the loss of such end customers or a significant delay or reduction in their purchases including reductions or delays due to customer departures from recent buying patterns or an unfavorable change in competitive conditions could materially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

some of our large end customers require more favorable terms and conditions from their vendors and may request price concessions as we seek to sell more products to these end customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenue 

our large end customers have significant purchasing power and as a result may receive more favorable terms and conditions than we typically provide to other end customers including lower prices bundled upgrades extended warranties acceptance terms indemnification terms and extended return policies and other contractual rights as we seek to sell more products to these large end customers an increased mix of our shipments may be subject to such terms and conditions which may reduce our margins or affect the timing of our revenue recognition and thus may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we face intense competition especially from larger wellestablished companies and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

the markets in which we compete including the markets for data center and campus networking are intensely competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants this competition could result in increased pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and our failure to increase or the loss of market share any of which would likely seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the data center and campus networking markets have been historically dominated by cisco systems “cisco” with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including extreme networks dellemc hewlett packard enterprise juniper networks and mist systems most of our competitors and some strategic alliance partners have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example in the last few years alone  broadcom acquired brocade communications systems extreme networks purchased certain data center networking assets from broadcombrocade and avaya dell acquired force10 and emc ibm acquired blade network technology hewlett packard enterprise acquired aruba networks juniper networks acquired contrail systems and cisco acquired insieme networks  we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants including “white box” switch vendors as well as current technology partners suppliers and end customers or other cloud service providers who mayacquire or develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products to market and sell to customers furthermore our relationships with our strategic alliance partners may shift as industry dynamics changes if strategic alliance partners acquire or develop competitive products or services our relationship with those partners may be adversely impacted which could lead to more variability to our results of operations and impact the pricing of our solutions 

many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

 our competitors also may be able to provide end customers with capabilities or benefits different from or greater than those we can provide in areas such as technical qualifications or geographic presence or may be able to provide end customers a broader range of products services and prices in addition large competitors may have more extensive relationships with and within existing and potential end customers that provide them with an advantage in competing for business with those end customers for example certain large competitors encourage end customers of their other products and services to adopt their data networking solutions through discounted bundled product packages our ability to compete will depend upon our ability to provide a better solution than 

our competitors at a more competitive price we may be required to make substantial additional investments in research development marketing and sales in order to respond to competition and we cannot assure you that these investments will achieve any returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

we also expect increased competition if our market continues to expand as we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic regions in particular we may experience pricefocused competition from competitors in asia especially from china as we expand into new markets we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other competitors including existing companies with strong technological marketing and sales positions in those markets as well as those with greater resources including technical and engineering resources than we do conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or other factors current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties that have greater resources available than we do our current or potential competitors might take advantage of the greater resources of the larger organization resulting from these acquisitions to compete more vigorously or broadly with us in addition continued industry consolidation might adversely affect end customers’ perceptions of the viability of smaller and even mediumsized networking companies and consequently end customers’ willingness to purchase from those companies further certain large end customers may develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products which could allow these end customers to become new competitors in the market 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

most of our competitors and some strategic alliance partners have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example in the last few years alone  broadcom acquired brocade communications systems extreme networks purchased certain data center networking assets from broadcombrocade and avaya dell acquired force10 and emc ibm acquired blade network technology hewlett packard enterprise acquired aruba networks juniper networks acquired contrail systems and cisco acquired insieme networks  

moreover large system vendors are increasingly seeking to deliver toptobottom cloud networking solutions to end customers that combine cloudfocused hardware and software solutions to provide an alternative to our products 

we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations our relationship with our strategic alliance partners may shift as industry dynamics change for example companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors and could combine competitor product portfolios into unified offerings optimized for their platforms such changes could result in a reduction of business with us a change in the terms upon which they offer us their products and services or even a termination of our strategic partnerships entirely industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete with us including any competitors that seek to become sole source vendors for end customers this could lead to more variability in our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business the pricing of our solutions financial condition results of operations and prospects 

managing the supply of our products and product components is complex insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing the supply of our products and product components is complex and our inventory management systems and related supplychain visibility tools may not enable us to forecast accurately and manage effectively the supply of our products and product components 

insufficient supply and inventory may result in increased lead times for our products lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply from time to time we may issue purchase orders for components and products that are noncancelable and nonreturnable we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our component inventory suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or for products that are considered obsolete in addition we establish a liability and reimburse 

our contract manufacturer for component inventory purchased on our behalf that has been rendered excess or obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders or in cases where inventory levels greatly exceed our demand forecasts 

supply management remains an increased area of focus as we balance the need to maintain sufficient supply levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of obsolescence or the end of life of certain products if we ultimately determine that we have excess supply we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins we record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value 

alternatively insufficient supply levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential end customers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available additionally any increases in the time required to manufacture our products or ship products could result in supply shortfalls if we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

because some of the key components in our products come from sole or limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers and may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

our products rely on key components including merchant silicon chips integrated circuit components printed circuit boards connectors customtooled sheet metal and power supplies that we purchase or our contract manufacturers purchase on our behalf from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers generally we do not have guaranteed supply contracts with our component suppliers and our suppliers could suffer shortages delay shipments prioritize shipments to other vendors increase prices or cease manufacturing such products or selling them to us at any time for example in the past we have experienced shortages in inventory for dynamic random access memory integrated circuits and delayed releases of the next generation of chipset which delayed our production andor the release of our new products the development of alternate sources for those components is timeconsuming difficult and costly if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner or if we are unable to obtain alternative sources for these components sales of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products any of these events could result in lost sales reduced gross margins or damage to our end customer relationships which would adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our reliance on component suppliers also yields the potential for their infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property rights with respect to components which may be incorporated into our products we may not be indemnified by such component suppliers for such infringement or misappropriation claims any litigation for which we do not receive indemnification could require us to incur significant legal expenses in defending against such claims or require us to pay substantial royalty payments or settlement amounts that would not be reimbursed by our component suppliers 

our product development efforts are also dependent upon our continued collaboration with our key merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap we select specific merchant silicon from these vendors for each new product and it is critical that we work in tandem with these vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features that our products take advantage of such improved features and that such vendors are able to supply us with sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable term to meet customer demand our relationship with these merchant silicon vendors enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions however merchant silicon vendors may not continue to collaborate with us or may become competitive with us by selling merchant silicon for “white boxes” or other products to our customers 

if our key merchant silicon vendors no longer collaborate in such a fashion if they do not continue to innovate if there are delays in the release of their products or supply shortages or if such merchant silicon is not offered to us on commercially reasonable terms our products may become less competitive own product launches could be delayed or we may be required to redesign our products to incorporate alternative merchant silicon which 

could result in lost sales reduce gross margins damage to our customer relationships or otherwise have a material effect on revenue and business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in the event of a shortage or supply interruption from our component suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner further longterm supply and maintenance obligations to end customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in addition our component suppliers change their selling prices frequently in response to market trends including industrywide increases in demand and because we do not have contracts with these suppliers or guaranteed pricing we are susceptible to availability or price fluctuations related to raw materials and components if we are unable to pass component price increases along to our end customers or maintain stable pricing our gross margins could be adversely affected and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

because we depend on thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping endcustomer orders on time if at all or on a costeffective basis which may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

we depend on thirdparty contract manufacturers to manufacture our product lines a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to these thirdparty contract manufacturers our reliance on these thirdparty contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process quality assurance product costs and product supply and timing which exposes us to risk to the extent that our products are manufactured at facilities in foreign countries we may be subject to additional risks associated with complying with local rules and regulations in those jurisdictions our reliance on contract manufacturers also yields the potential for their infringement of third party intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of our products or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of other customers’ products if we are unable to manage our relationships with our thirdparty contract manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers suffer delays or disruptions or quality control problems in their operations experience increased manufacturing lead times capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our end customers would be severely impaired and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be seriously harmed 

our contract manufacturers typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual orders we do not have longterm contracts with our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular pricing terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements which could result in supply shortages and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice for example a competitor could place large orders with the thirdparty manufacturer thereby utilizing all or substantially all of such thirdparty manufacturer’s capacity and leaving the manufacturer little or no capacity to fulfill our individual orders without price increases or delays or at all our contract with one of our contract manufacturers permits it to terminate the agreement for convenience subject to prior notice requirements we may not be able to develop alternate or second contract manufacturers in a timely manner 

if we add or change contract manufacturers or change any manufacturing plant locations within a contract manufacturer network we would add additional complexity and risk to our supply chain management and may increase our working capital requirements ensuring a new contract manufacturer or new plant location is qualified to manufacture our products to our standards and industry requirements could take significant effort and be time consuming and expensive any addition or change in manufacturers may be extremely costly time consuming and we may not be able to do so successfully 

in addition we may be subject to additional significant challenges in ensuring that quality processes and costs among other issues are consistent with our expectations and those of our customers a new contract manufacturer or manufacturing location may not be able to scale its production of our products at the volumes or quality we require this could also adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers which could damage our customer relationships and cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end customers late delivery penalties delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our 

gross margins this could also result in increased levels of inventory subjecting us to increased excess and obsolete charges that could have a negative impact on our operating results 

any production interruptions or disruptions for any reason including those noted above as well as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages adverse results from intellectual property litigation or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would adversely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

product quality problems defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate advanced technologies including both hardware and software technologies despite testing prior to their release our products may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in analyzing correcting or redesigning the products cause us to lose significant end customers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

from time to time we have had to replace certain components of products that we had shipped and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs including failures in software protocols or defective component batches resulting in reliability issues in such products and we may be required to do so in the future we may also be required to provide full replacements or refunds for such defective products we cannot assure you that such remediation would not have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects see “—our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects” 

interruptions or delays in shipments could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

we may be subject to supply chain delays or endcustomer buying patterns in which a substantial portion of sales orders and shipments may occur in the second half of each quarter this places significant pressure on order review and processing supply chain management manufacturing inventory and quality control management shipping and trade compliance to ensure that we have properly forecasted supply purchasing manufacturing capacity inventory and quality compliance and logistics a significant interruption in these critical functions it could result in delayed order fulfillment adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

we base our inventory requirements on our forecasts of future sales if these forecasts are materially inaccurate we may procure inventory that we may be unable to use in a timely manner or at all 

we and our contract manufacturers procure components and build our products based on our forecasts these forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products which are in turn based on historical trends and analyses from our sales and marketing organizations adjusted for overall market conditions and other factors to the extent our forecasts are materially inaccurate or if we otherwise do not need such inventory we may under or overprocure inventory and such inaccuracies in our forecasts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are currently involved in a license dispute with optumsoft inc 

on april 4 2014 optumsoft filed a lawsuit against us in the superior court of california santa clara county titled optumsoft inc v arista networks inc in which it asserts i ownership of certain components of our eos network operating system pursuant to the terms of a 2004 agreement between the companies and ii breaches of certain confidentiality and use restrictions in that agreement under the terms of the 2004 agreement optumsoft provided us with a nonexclusive irrevocable royaltyfree license to software delivered by optumsoft comprising a software tool used to develop certain components of eos and a runtime library that is incorporated 

into eos the 2004 agreement places certain restrictions on our use and disclosure of the optumsoft software and gives optumsoft ownership of improvements modifications and corrections to and derivative works of the optumsoft software that we develop 

in its lawsuit optumsoft has asked the court to order us to i give optumsoft access to our software for evaluation by optumsoft ii cease all conduct constituting the alleged confidentiality and use restriction breaches iii secure the return or deletion of optumsoft’s alleged intellectual property provided to third parties including our customers iv assign ownership to optumsoft of optumsoft’s alleged intellectual property currently owned by us and v pay optumsoft’s alleged damages attorney’s fees and costs of the lawsuit david cheriton one of our founders and a former member of our board of directors who resigned from our board of directors on march 1 2014 and has no continuing role with us is a founder and we believe the largest stockholder and director of optumsoft the 2010 david r cheriton irrevocable trust dated july 28 2010 a trust for the benefit of the minor children of mr cheriton is one of our largest stockholders 

on april 14 2014 we filed a crosscomplaint against optumsoft in which we asserted our ownership of the software components at issue and our interpretation of the 2004 agreement among other things we asserted that the language of the 2004 agreement and the parties’ long course of conduct support our ownership of the disputed software components we asked the court to declare our ownership of those software components all similarlysituated software components developed in the future and all related intellectual property we also asserted that even if we are found not to own certain components such components are licensed to us under the terms of the 2004 agreement however there can be no assurance that our assertions will ultimately prevail in litigation on the same day we also filed an answer to optumsoft’s claims as well as affirmative defenses based in part on optumsoft’s failure to maintain the confidentiality of its claimed trade secrets its authorization of the disclosures it asserts and its delay in claiming ownership of the software components at issue we have also taken additional steps to respond to optumsoft’s allegations that we improperly used andor disclosed optumsoft confidential information while we believe we have meritorious defenses to these allegations we believe we have i revised our software to remove the elements we understand to be the subject of the claims relating to improper use and disclosure of optumsoft confidential information and made the revised software available to our customers and ii removed information from our website that optumsoft asserted disclosed optumsoft confidential information 

the parties tried phase i of the case relating to contract interpretation and application of the contract to certain claimed source code in september 2015 on march 23 2016 the court issued a final statement of decision following phase i trial in which it agreed with and adopted our interpretation of the 2004 agreement and held that we and not optumsoft own all the software at issue in phase i the remaining issues that were not addressed in the phase i trial are set to be tried in phase ii including the application of the court’s interpretation of the 2004 agreement to any other source code that optumsoft claims to own following a review and the trade secret misappropriation and confidentiality claims the phase ii trial is set for september 23 2019 by the judge 

we intend to vigorously defend against any claims brought against us by optumsoft however we cannot be certain that if litigated any claims by optumsoft would be resolved in our favor for example if it were determined that optumsoft owned components of our eos network operating system we would be required to transfer ownership of those components and any related intellectual property to optumsoft if optumsoft were the owner of those components it could make them available to our competitors such as through a sale or license an adverse litigation ruling could result in a significant damages award against us and injunctive relief in addition optumsoft could assert additional or different claims against us including claims that our license from optumsoft is invalid 

the sales prices of our products and services may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our results of operations 

the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts a change in our mix of products and services the introduction of new products and services by us or by our competitors including the adoption of “white box” solutions promotional programs product and related warranty costs or broader macroeconomic factors in addition we have provided and may in the future provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in 

which such sales occur our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers 

we have experienced declines in sales prices for our products competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and services additionally although we generally price our products worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may adversely affect actual prices that partners and end customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles decreased sales prices for any reason may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our result of operations 

our ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings and our failure to offer highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

once our products are deployed within our end customers’ networks our end customers depend on our support organization and our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products highquality support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products if we or our channel partners do not assist our end customers in deploying our products effectively do not succeed in helping our end customers resolve postdeployment issues quickly or do not provide adequate ongoing support it could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing end customers and could harm our reputation with potential end customers in addition as we expand our operations internationally our support organization will face additional challenges including those associated with delivering support training and documentation in languages other than english our failure or the failure of our channel partners to maintain highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on end customers renewing their maintenance and support contracts any decline in maintenance renewals could harm our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we typically sell our products with maintenance and support as part of the initial purchase and a portion of our annual revenue comes from renewals of maintenance and support contracts our end customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance and support contracts after the expiration of the initial period and they may elect not to renew their maintenance and support contracts to renew their maintenance and support contracts at lower prices through alternative channel partners or to reduce the product quantity under their maintenance and support contracts thereby reducing our future revenue from maintenance and support contracts if our end customers especially our large end customers do not renew their maintenance and support contracts or if they renew them on terms that are less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

if we are unable to increase market awareness of our company and our products our revenue may not continue to grow or may decline 

we have not yet established broad market awareness of our products and services market awareness of our value proposition and products and services will be essential to our continued growth and our success particularly for the service provider and large enterprise markets if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful in creating market awareness of our company and our products and services then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth 

if we are unable to hire retain train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel particularly software engineering and sales personnel competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense especially in the san francisco bay area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have 

to provide more attractive compensation packages and other amenities research and development personnel are aggressively recruited by startup and growth companies which are especially active in many of the technical areas and geographic regions in which we conduct product development in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the hightechnology industry job candidates often consider the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to attract motivate or retain key employees if we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel or if there are delays in hiring required personnel our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be seriously harmed 

also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that such personnel has been improperly solicited that such personnel has divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that former employers own certain inventions or other work product such claims could result in litigation please see “we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us” 

we employ a number of foreign nationals who are required to obtain visas and entry permits in order to legally work in the united states and other countries the united states has recently increased the level of scrutiny in granting h1b l1 and other business visas and the current administration has indicated that immigration reform is a priority our compliance with united states immigration and labor laws could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain skilled professionals 

our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations our employment arrangements with our employees do not require that they continue to work for us for any specified period and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of our key personnel including jayshree ullal our chief executive officer andy bechtolsheim our founder and chief development officer kenneth duda our founder chief technology officer and svp of software engineering anshul sadana our chief customer officer or other members of our senior management team sales and marketing team or engineering team or any difficulty attracting or retaining other highly qualified personnel in the future could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we do not effectively expand and train our direct sales force we may be unable to add new end customers or increase sales to our existing end customers and our business will be adversely affected 

we depend on our direct sales force to obtain new end customers and increase sales with existing end customers as such we have invested and will continue to invest in our sales organization in recent periods we have been adding personnel and other resources to our sales function as we focus on growing our business entering new markets and increasing our market share and we expect to incur additional expenses in expanding our sales personnel in order to achieve revenue growth there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training retaining and integrating sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth particularly in international markets new hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect and we may be unable to hire retain or integrate into our corporate culture sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business in addition because we continue to grow rapidly a large percentage of our sales force is new to our company if we are unable to hire integrate and train a sufficient number of effective sales personnel or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new end customers or increasing sales to our existing endcustomer base our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected 

we are subject to a number of risks associated with the expansion of our international sales and operations 

our ability to grow our business and our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide we have a limited history of marketing selling and supporting our products and services internationally operating in a global marketplace we are subject to risks associated with having an international reach and requirements such as compliance with applicable anticorruption laws 

one such applicable anticorruption law is the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and its employees and intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business securing an advantage and directing business to another and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors officers employees agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives as such if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation governmental authorities in the us and elsewhere could seek to impose civil andor criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions failure to comply with anticorruption and antibribery laws such as the fcpa and the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 or the uk bribery act and similar laws associated with our activities outside the us could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences we intend to increase our international sales and business and as such the risk of violating laws such as the fcpa and uk bribery act increases 

additionally the us government has adopted broader sanctions and embargoes that generally forbid supplying many items to or involving certain countries territories governments legal entities and individuals including restrictions imposed by the us and eu on exports to russia and ukraine we have implemented systems to detect and prevent sales into these countries or to prohibit entities or individuals but we are necessarily dependent in part on our thirdparty suppliers and distributors to implement these systems we cannot assure you that these systems will always be effective or that our suppliers and distributors effectively implement our systems to detect and prevent such sales without our prior knowledge and we may incur additional unexpected costs or expenses to comply with applicable trade restrictions 

as a result of our international reach we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or to recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the us and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in endcustomer contracts although to date we generally have not done so to the extent that we may enter into endcustomer contracts in the future that include nonstandard terms related to payment warranties or performance obligations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 



 these and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenue and consequently materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects expanding our existing international operations and entering into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial commitments our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit our future growth or materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

moreover our business is also impacted by the negotiation and implementation of free trade agreements between the united states and other countries such agreements can reduce barriers to international trade and thus the cost of conducting business overseas for instance the united states recently reached a new trilateral trade agreement with the governments of canada and mexico to replace the north american free trade agreement “nafta” if the united states withdraws from nafta and the three countries fail to approve the new agreements known as the united statesmexicocanada agreement our cost of doing business within the three countries could increase 

the united kingdom’s vote to leave the european union will have uncertain effects and could adversely affect us 

on june 23 2016 the electorate in the united kingdom or uk voted in favor of leaving the european union or eu commonly referred to as the “brexit” thereafter on march 29 2017 the country formally notified the eu of its intention to withdraw pursuant to article 50 of the lisbon treaty triggering the twoyear negotiation period for exiting the eu the withdrawal of the uk from the eu is scheduled to take effect on march 29 2019 either on the effective date of the withdrawal agreement or in the absence of agreement two years after the uk provides a notice of withdrawal pursuant to the eu treaty and transitional provisions may or may not be put in place to ease the process 

the effects of brexit will depend on agreements the uk makes to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently brexit creates an uncertain political and economic environment in the uk and potentially across other eu member states for the foreseeable future including during any period while the terms of brexit are being negotiated and such uncertainties could impair or limit our ability to transact business in the member eu states 

further brexit could adversely affect european and worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial markets and the value of the pound sterling currency or other currencies including the euro we are exposed to the economic market and fiscal conditions in the uk and the eu and to 

changes in any of these conditions depending on the terms reached regarding brexit it is possible that there may be adverse practical andor operational implications on our business 

a significant amount of the regulatory regime that applies to us in the uk is derived from eu directives and regulations for so long as the uk remains a member of the eu those sources of legislation will unless otherwise repealed or amended remain in effect however brexit could change the legal and regulatory framework within the uk where we operate and is likely to lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate consequently no assurance can be given as to the impact of brexit and in particular no assurance can be given that our operating results financial condition and prospects would not be adversely impacted by the result 

enhanced united states tax tariff importexport restrictions chinese regulations or other trade barriers may have a negative effect on global economic conditions financial markets and our business 

there is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united states and various other countries most significantly china with respect trade policies treaties tariffs and taxes including trade policies and tariffs regarding china the current us administration has called for substantial changes to us foreign trade policy with respect to china and other countries including the possibility of imposing greater restrictions on international trade and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the united states in 2018 the office of the us trade representative the “ustr” enacted tariffs on imports into the us from china including communications equipment products and components manufactured and imported from china the tariff became effective on september 24 2018 with an initial rate of 10 and was scheduled to increase from 10 to 25 on january 1 2019 however that increase has been delayed for 90 days pending trade negotiations between the us and china in addition the tariffs may be increased in the future it is expected that these tariffs will cause our costs to increase which could narrow the profits we earn from sales of products requiring such materials furthermore if tariffs trade restrictions or trade barriers are placed on products such as ours by foreign governments especially china the prices for our products may increase which may result in the loss of customers and our business financial condition and results of operations may be harmed we believe we can adjust our supply chain and manufacturing practices to minimize the impact of the tariffs but our efforts may not be successful there can be no assurance that we will not experience a disruption in our business related to these or other changes in trade practices and the process of changing suppliers in order to mitigate any such tariff costs could be complicated timeconsuming and costly 

furthermore the us tariffs may cause customers to delay orders as they evaluate where to take delivery of our products in connection with their efforts to mitigate their own tariff exposure such delays create forecasting difficulties for us and increase the risk that orders might be canceled or might never be placed current or future tariffs imposed by the us may also negatively impact our customers sales thereby causing an indirect negative impact on our own sales any reduction in our customers sales andor any apprehension among distributors and customers of a possible reduction in such sales would likely cause an indirect negative impact on our own sales even in the absence of further tariffs the related uncertainty and the markets fear of an escalating trade war might cause our distributors and customers to place fewer orders for our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business liquidity financial condition andor results of operations 

additionally the current us administration continues to signal that it may alter trade agreements and terms between china and the united states including limiting trade with china and may impose additional tariffs on imports from china therefore it is possible further tariffs may be imposed that could cover imports of communications equipment products and components used in our products or our business may be adversely impacted by retaliatory trade measures taken by china or other countries including restricted access to suppliers communications equipment products and components used in our products causing us to raise prices or make changes to our products which could materially harm our business financial condition and results of operations the current administration along with congress has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united states and other countries with respect to the trade policies treaties taxes government regulations and tariffs that would be applicable it is unclear what changes might be considered or implemented and what response to any such changes may be by the governments of other countries these changes have created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the united states and china as well as other countries including with respect to the trade policies treaties government regulations and tariffs that could apply to trade 

between the united states and other nations these developments or the perception that any of them could occur may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets and may significantly reduce global trade and in particular trade between these nations and the united states any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to suppliers or customers and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and affect our strategy in china and elsewhere around the world given the relatively fluid regulatory environment in china and the united states and uncertainty how the us administration or foreign governments will act with respect to tariffs international trade agreements and policies a trade war further governmental action related to tariffs or international trade policies or additional tax or other regulatory changes in the future could directly and adversely impact our financial results and results of operations 

sales of our 7000 series of switches generate most of our product revenue and if we are unable to continue to grow sales of these products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

historically we have derived substantially all of our product revenue from sales of our 7000 series of switches and we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future we have experienced declines in sales prices for our products including our 10 gigabit ethernet modular and fixed switches a decline in the price of our 7000 series of switches and related services or our inability to increase sales of these products would harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects more seriously than if we derived significant revenue from a larger variety of product lines and services our future financial performance will also depend upon successfully developing and selling nextgeneration versions of our 7000 series of switches if we fail to deliver new products new features or new releases that end customers want and that allow us to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

seasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations 

we operate on a december 31st year end and believe that there are significant seasonal factors which may cause sequential product revenue growth to be greater for the second and fourth quarters of our year than our first and third quarters we believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors including the procurement budgeting and deployment cycles of many of our end customers our rapid historical growth may have reduced the impact of seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date as our increasing size causes our growth rate to slow seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

assessing our processes procedures and staffing in order to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes many of which are done manually and are dependent upon individual data input or review these processes include but are not limited to calculating revenue inventory costs and the preparation of our statement of cash flows while we continue to automate our processes and enhance our review controls to reduce the likelihood for errors we expect that for the foreseeable future many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error 

in the past we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and we cannot give assurance that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future the existence of one or more material weaknesses could preclude a conclusion by management that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting the existence or disclosure of any such material weakness could adversely affect our stock price 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology and network infrastructure spending may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology network connectivity and access to data and applications weak domestic or global economic conditions fear or anticipation of such conditions or 

a reduction in information technology and network infrastructure spending even if economic conditions improve could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our distributors reduced unit sales and lower or no growth for example the global macroeconomic environment could be negatively affected by among other things instability in global economic markets resulting from increased us trade tariffs on steel and other products and trade disputes between the us and other countries instability in the global credit markets the impact and uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy rising interest rates and increased inflation including the recent rise in us interest rates the instability in the geopolitical environment as a result of the united kingdom “brexit” decision to withdraw from the european union economic challenges in china and ongoing us and foreign governmental debt concerns such challenges have caused and are likely to continue to cause uncertainty and instability in local economies and in global financial markets particularly if any future sovereign debt defaults or significant bank failures or defaults occur market uncertainty and instability in europe or asia could intensify or spread further particularly if ongoing stabilization efforts prove insufficient continuing or worsening economic instability could adversely affect spending for it network infrastructure systems and tools continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may also affect the overall demand for our products although we do not believe that our business financial condition results of operations and prospects have been significantly adversely affected by economic and political uncertainty in europe asia or other countries to date deterioration of such conditions may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in the future a prolonged period of economic uncertainty or a downturn may also significantly affect financing markets the availability of capital and the terms and conditions of financing arrangements including the overall cost of financing as well as the financial health or creditworthiness of our end customers circumstances may arise in which we need or desire to raise additional capital and such capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 

from time to time in addition to the litigation involving optumsoft described elsewhere in these risk factors we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent copyright commercial product liability employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims in addition to governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources cause us to incur significant expenses or liability andor require us to change our business practices for example we were previously involved in litigation with cisco because of the potential risks expenses and uncertainties of litigation we may from time to time settle disputes even where we have meritorious claims or defenses by agreeing to settlement agreements because litigation is inherently unpredictable we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

for more information regarding the litigation in which we are currently involved see the “legal proceedings” subheading in in note 7 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k  incorporated herein by reference 

assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights or other lawsuits asserted against us could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network infrastructure industry and have resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies many companies in the network infrastructure industry including our competitors and other third parties as well as nonpracticing entities own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us from time to time they have or may in the future also assert such claims against us our end customers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties for example we are currently a party to litigation involving optumsoft described elsewhere in these risk factors and we have previously been involved in litigation with cisco 

as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur or if we enter into new markets claims of infringement misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase any claim of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim distract our management from our business and require us to cease use of such intellectual property in addition some claims for patent infringement may relate to subcomponents that we purchase from third parties if these third parties are unable or unwilling to indemnify us for these claims we could be substantially harmed 

the patent portfolios of most of our competitors are larger than ours this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent crosslicenses in addition future assertions of patent rights by third parties and any resulting litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection we cannot assure you that we are not infringing or otherwise violating any thirdparty intellectual property rights 

the thirdparty asserters of intellectual property claims may be unreasonable in their demands or may simply refuse to settle which could lead to expensive settlement payments prolonged periods of litigation and related expenses additional burdens on employees or other resources distraction from our business supply stoppages and lost sales 

an adverse outcome of a dispute including those lawsuits described under the “legal proceedings” subheading in note 7   commitments and contingencies  and the settlement with cisco described in note 14  legal settlement  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k may require us to pay substantial damages or penalties including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party’s patents cease making licensing using or importing into the us products or services that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others expend additional development resources to attempt to redesign our products or services or otherwise to develop noninfringing technology which may not be successful enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or intellectual property rights and indemnify our partners and other third parties any damages penalties or royalty obligations we may become subject to as a result of an adverse outcome and any thirdparty indemnity we may need to provide could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects royalty or licensing agreements if required or desirable may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures further there is little or no information publicly available concerning market or fair values for license fees which can lead to overpayment of license or settlement fees in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us suppliers subject to thirdparty intellectual property claims also may choose or be forced to discontinue or alter their arrangements with us with little or no advance notice to us any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in the event that we are found to infringe any third party intellectual property we could be enjoined or subject to other remedial orders that would prohibit us from making licensing using or importing into the us such products or services in order to resume such activities with respect to any affected products or services we or our component suppliers would be required to develop technical redesigns to this third party intellectual property that no longer infringe the third party intellectual property in any efforts to develop technical redesigns for these products or services we or our component suppliers may be unable to do so in a manner that does not continue to infringe the third party intellectual property or that is acceptable to our customers these redesign efforts could be extremely costly and time consuming as well as disruptive to our other development activities and distracting to management moreover such redesigns could require us to obtain approvals from the court or administrative body to resume the activities with respect to these affected solutions we may not be successful in our efforts to obtain such approvals in a timely manner or at all any failure to effectively redesign our solutions or to obtain timely approval of those redesigns by a court or administrative body may cause a disruption to our product shipments and materially and adversely affect our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition for example in two prior investigations brought by cisco in the international trade 

commission “itc” we were subjected to remedial orders that prohibited us from importing and selling after importation any products the itc found to infringe cisco’s patents as a result we were required to redesign certain aspects of our products and obtain customs approval of those redesigns before we could continue to import those products into the united states 

our standard sales contracts contain indemnification provisions requiring us to defend our end customers against thirdparty claims including against infringement of certain intellectual property rights that could expose us to losses which could seriously harm our business financial conditions results of operations and prospects 

under the indemnification provisions of our standard sales contracts we agree to defend our end customers and channel partners against thirdparty claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights which may include patents copyrights trademarks or trade secrets and to pay judgments entered on such claims an adverse ruling in such litigation may potentially expose us to claims in the event that claims are brought against our customers based on the ruling and we are required to indemnify such customers 

our exposure under these indemnification provisions is frequently limited to the total amount paid by our end customer under the agreement however certain agreements include indemnification provisions that could potentially expose us to losses in excess of the amount received under the agreement any of these events including claims for indemnification could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights 

we depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology we rely on trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection 

the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner we may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions further we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims to the extent that additional patents are issued from our patent applications which is not certain they may be contested circumvented or invalidated in the future moreover the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages and as with any technology competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future in addition we rely on confidentiality or license agreements with third parties in connection with their use of our products and technology there is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements or that we will be able to adequately enforce our rights in part because we rely on “shrinkwrap” licenses in some instances 

we have not registered our trademarks in all geographic markets failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our ability to enforce and defend our trademark rights and result in indemnification claims further any claim of infringement by a third party even those claims without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claim could divert management attention from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property in certain geographic markets 

despite our efforts the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the united states 

detecting and protecting against the unauthorized use of our products technology and proprietary rights is expensive difficult and in some cases impossible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources either of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and there is no guarantee 

that we would be successful furthermore many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to protecting their technology or intellectual property rights than we do accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property which could result in a substantial loss of our market share 

we rely on the availability of licenses to thirdparty software and other intellectual property 

many of our products and services include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties and we otherwise use software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties in our business this exposes us to risks over which we may have little or no control for example a licensor may have difficulties keeping up with technological changes or may stop supporting the software or other intellectual property that it licenses to us also it will be necessary in the future to renew licenses expand the scope of existing licenses or seek new licenses relating to various aspects of these products and services or otherwise relating to our business which may result in increased license fees these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms if at all in addition a third party may assert that we or our end customers are in breach of the terms of a license which could among other things give such third party the right to terminate a license or seek damages from us or both the inability to obtain or maintain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain or maintain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in releases of products and services and could otherwise disrupt our business until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and services or otherwise in the conduct of our business moreover the inclusion in our products and services of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis may limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software that we use if we combine our software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release portions of the source code of our software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products moreover we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products will be effective if we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products on terms that are not economically feasible to reengineer our products to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available in source code form our proprietary code any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products must interoperate with operating systems software applications and hardware that is developed by others and if we are unable to devote the necessary resources to ensure that our products interoperate with such software and hardware we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening demand for our products 

generally our products comprise only a part of the data center and must interoperate with our end customers’ existing infrastructure specifically their networks servers software and operating systems which may be manufactured by a wide variety of vendors and original equipment manufacturers or oems our products must 

comply with established industry standards in order to interoperate with the servers storage software and other networking equipment in the data center such that all systems function efficiently together we depend on the vendors of servers and systems in a data center to support prevailing industry standards often these vendors are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are also some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our end customers 

in addition when new or updated versions of these software operating systems or applications are introduced we must sometimes develop updated versions of our software so that our products will interoperate properly we may not accomplish these development efforts quickly costeffectively or at all these development efforts require capital investment and the devotion of engineering resources if we fail to maintain compatibility with these systems and applications our end customers may not be able to adequately utilize our products and we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening in demand for our products among other consequences which would adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we provide access to our software and other selected source code to certain partners which creates additional risk that our competitors could develop products that are similar to or better than ours 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our internally developed technology which is incorporated in the source code for our products we seek to protect the source code design code documentation and other information relating to our software under trade secret patent and copyright laws however we have chosen to provide access to selected source code of our software to several of our partners for codevelopment as well as for open application programming interfaces or apis formats and protocols though we generally control access to our source code and other intellectual property and enter into confidentiality or license agreements with such partners as well as with our employees and consultants this combination of procedural and contractual safeguards may be insufficient to protect our trade secrets and other rights to our technology our protective measures may be inadequate especially because we may not be able to prevent our partners employees or consultants from violating any agreements or licenses we may have in place or abusing their access granted to our source code improper disclosure or use of our source code could help competitors develop products similar to or better than ours 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and to be adversely affected by numerous factors 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and the gross margins we have achieved in recent years may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including 



 we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quarter to quarter failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense as a result our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly 

the timing of our sales and revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of our products’ sales cycles a sales cycle is the period between initial contact with a prospective end customer and any sale of our products endcustomer orders often involve the purchase of multiple products these orders are complex and difficult to complete because prospective end customers generally consider a number of factors over an extended period of time before committing to purchase the products and solutions we sell end customers especially in the case of our large end customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision and require considerable time to evaluate test and qualify our products prior to making a purchase decision and placing an order the length of time that end customers devote to their evaluation contract negotiation and budgeting processes varies significantly our products’ sales cycles can be lengthy in certain cases especially with respect to our prospective large end customers during the sales cycle we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities and make investments in evaluation equipment all of which lower our operating margins particularly if no sale occurs even if an end customer decides to purchase our products there are many factors affecting the timing of our recognition of revenue which makes our revenue difficult to forecast for example there may be unexpected delays in an end customer’s internal procurement processes particularly for some of our larger end customers for which our products represent a very small percentage of their total procurement activity there are many other factors specific to end customers that contribute to the timing of their purchases and the variability of our revenue recognition including the strategic importance of a particular project to an end customer budgetary constraints and changes in their personnel 

even after an end customer makes a purchase there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase in addition the significance and timing of our product enhancements and the introduction of new products by our competitors may also affect end customers’ purchases for all of these reasons it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed the particular period in which a sale will be completed or the period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized if our sales cycles lengthen our revenue could be lower than expected which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release they have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our end customers’ willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our products could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our products could result in claims by end customers for losses that they sustain if end customers make these types of claims we may be required or may choose for endcustomer relations or other reasons to expend additional resources in order to address the problem we may also be required to repair or replace such products or provide a refund for the purchase price for such products liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale and those of our resellers and distributors may not be enforceable under some circumstances or may not fully or effectively protect us from endcustomer claims and related liabilities and costs including indemnification obligations under our agreements with end customers resellers and distributors the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in expenditures of funds in connection with litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

levels or types of insurance coverage purchased may not adequately cover claims or liabilities 

we maintain insurance to protect against certain types of claims associated with the use of our products operations property damage casualty and other risks but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover all claims or penalties depending on our assumptions regarding level of risk availability cost and other considerations we purchase differing amounts of insurance from time to time and in various locations our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and policy limits that may require us to selfinsure certain types of claims or claims in certain countries if our level of insurance is inadequate or a loss isn’t covered by insurance we could be required to pay unpredictable and substantial amounts that could have a substantial negative impact on our financial results or operations   

in addition to our own direct sales force we rely on distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers to sell our products and our failure to effectively develop manage or prevent disruptions to our distribution channels and the processes and procedures that support them could cause a reduction in the number of end customers of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon maintaining our relationships with distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers and establishing additional sales channel relationships we anticipate that sales of our products to a limited number of channel partners will continue to account for a material portion of our total product revenue for the foreseeable future we provide our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our products but these steps may not be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services if we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive programs for our channel partners we may not be able to incentivize these partners to sell our products to end customers these partners may have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our products altogether one of our channel partners could elect to consolidate or enter into a strategic partnership with one of our competitors which could reduce or eliminate our future opportunities with that channel partner our agreements with our channel partners may generally be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice we may be unable to retain these channel partners or secure additional or replacement channel partners the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners requires extensive training and any new or expanded relationship with a channel partner may take several months or more to achieve productivity 

where we rely on the channel partners for sales of our products we may have little or no contact with the ultimate users of our products that purchase through such channel partners thereby making it more difficult 

for us to establish brand awareness ensure proper delivery and installation of our products service ongoing endcustomer requirements estimate endcustomer demand and respond to evolving endcustomer needs in addition our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to end customers fail to comply with their contractual obligations or violate laws or our corporate policies if we fail to effectively manage our existing sales channels or if our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our products if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of highquality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

we anticipate increasing our sales efforts to us and foreign federal state and local governmental end customers in the future sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we have attained revised certifications government demand and payment for our products and services may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects selling to government entities may also require us to comply with various regulations that are not applicable to sales to nongovernment entities including regulations that may relate to pricing classified material and other matters complying with such regulations may also require us to put in place controls and procedures to monitor compliance with the applicable regulations that may be costly or not possible we are not currently certified to perform work under classified contracts with government entities failure to comply with any such regulations could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government ceasing to buy our products and services a reduction of revenue fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the us government may require certain products that it purchases to be manufactured in the us and other relatively highcost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet these requirements any of these and other circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we may invest in or acquire other businesses which could require significant management attention disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we may make investments in complementary companies products or technologies which could involve licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in or acquisitions of other companies for example we completed the acquisition of mojo networks inc “mojo” in august 2018 and the acquisition of metamako holding pty ltd “metamako” in september 2018 however we do not have significant experience in making investments in other companies nor had we made any acquisitions prior to those of mojo and metamako and as a result our ability as an organization to evaluate andor complete investments or acquire and integrate other companies products or technologies in a successful manner is unproven we may not be able to find suitable investment or acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete such investments or acquisitions on favorable terms if at all if we do complete investments or acquisitions we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and any investments or acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end customers investors and securities analysts 

in addition investments and acquisitions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures for example if we are unsuccessful at integrating any acquisitions or retaining key talent from those acquisitions or the technologies associated with such acquisitions into our company the business financial condition results of operations and prospects of the combined company could be adversely affected we may have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business or the acquired technologies or research and development expectations may prove unsuccessful any integration process may require significant time and resources and we may not be able to manage the process successfully acquisitions may also disrupt our ongoing business divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel or accurately forecast the financial effects of an acquisition transaction including accounting charges any acquisition or investment could expose us to unknown liabilities moreover we cannot assure you that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment would be realized or that we would not be exposed to unknown liabilities we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such investment or acquisition each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations moreover if the investment or acquisition becomes impaired we may be required to take an impairment charge which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock 

furthermore through acquisitions we continue to expand into new markets and new market segments and we may experience challenges in entering into new market segments for which we have not previously manufactured and sold products including facing exposure to new market risks difficulty achieving expected business results due to a lack of experience in new markets products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar distribution partners or vendors 

if we needed to raise additional capital to expand our operations invest in new products or for other corporate purposes our failure to do so on favorable terms could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future if we did need to raise additional funds to expand our operations invest in new products or for other corporate purposes we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms if at all if we raise additional equity financing our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our common stock could decline furthermore if we engage in debt financing the holders of such debt would have priority over the holders of common stock and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or impose other restrictions on our business we may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders including maintaining specified liquidity or other ratios any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms if at all we may not be able to among other things 

 our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as described in part ii item 7 of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities equity revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation and contract manufacturersupplier liabilities income taxes and loss contingencies if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions our results of operations may be adversely affected and may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

we are exposed to the credit risk of our channel partners and some of our end customers which could result in material losses   

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with standard payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the us we monitor individual endcustomer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the end customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts we are unable to recognize revenue from shipments until the collection of those amounts becomes reasonably assured any significant delay or default in the collection of significant accounts receivable could result in an increased need for us to obtain working capital from other sources possibly on worse terms than we could have negotiated if we had established such working capital resources prior to such delays or defaults any significant default could adversely affect our results of operations and delay our ability to recognize revenue 

a material portion of our sales is derived through our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers some of our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers may experience financial difficulties which could adversely affect our collection of accounts receivable distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other systems integrators valueadded resellers and end customers distributors represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be less likely to have the reserve resources required to meet payment obligations our exposure to credit risks of our channel partners may increase if our channel partners and their end customers are adversely affected by global or regional economic conditions one or more of these channel partners could delay payments or default on credit extended to them either of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening us dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our end customers outside of the us which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase our product and operating costs in foreign locations further an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the us is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates if we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with the currency fluctuations our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

our corporate headquarters and the operations of our key manufacturing vendors logistics providers and partners as well as many of our customers are located in areas exposed to risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis including the san francisco bay area japan and taiwan a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake tsunami fire or a flood or other catastrophic event such as a disease outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our or their business which could in turn materially affect our financial condition results of operations and prospects for example in the event our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed which could result in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter further if a natural disaster occurs in a region from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue end customers in that region may delay or forego purchases of our products which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or end customers or the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end any disruption in the business of our manufacturers logistics providers partners or end customers that affects sales at the end of our quarter could have a particularly significant adverse effect on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if our disaster recovery plans and those of our manufacturers logistics providers or partners prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of endcustomer orders or delays in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected 

breaches of our cybersecurity systems could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services to our customers delay our ability to recognize revenue compromise the integrity of our software products result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property damage our reputation expose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data 

we increasingly depend upon our it systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or that of our website and misappropriate our proprietary information or cause interruptions of our service because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system we have also outsourced a number of our business functions to thirdparties including our manufacturers logistics providers and cloud service providers and our business operations also depend in part on the success of these third parties own cybersecurity measures similarly we rely upon distributors resellers and system integrators to sell our products and our sales operations depend in part on the reliability of their cybersecurity measures additionally we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our it resources in safe and secure fashion that does not expose our network systems to security breaches and the loss of data accordingly if our cybersecurity systems and those of our contractors fail to protect against unauthorized access sophisticated cyber attacks and the mishandling of data by our employees and contractors our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways including 



 should any of the above events occur we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our customers and regulatory actions from governmental agencies in addition our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised and our reputation and competitive position could be significantly harmed also the regulatory and contractual actions litigations investigations fines penalties and liabilities relating to data breaches that result in losses of personally identifiable or credit card information of users of our services can be significant in terms of fines and reputational impact and necessitate changes to our business operations that may be disruptive to us additionally we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and remediate damages consequently our financial performance and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we believe our longterm value as a company will be greater if we focus primarily on growth instead of profitability 

our business strategy is to focus primarily on our longterm growth as a result our profitability in any given period may be lower than it would be if our strategy was to maximize shortterm profitability expenditures on research and development sales and marketing infrastructure and other such investments may not ultimately grow our business prospects or cause long term profitability for example in order to support our strong growth we have accelerated our investment in infrastructure such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations as a result we expect our levels of operating profit could decline in the short to medium term if we are ultimately unable to achieve or maintain profitability at the level anticipated by analysts and our stockholders the market price of our common stock may decline 

we may not generate positive returns on our research and development investments 

developing our products is expensive and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  our research and development expenses were 4425 million  or approximately 206  of our revenue 3496 million  or approximately 212  of our revenue and 2736 million  or approximately 242  of our revenue respectively we expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts by investing in research and development we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity we expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these investments these investments may take several years to generate positive returns if ever 

changes in our income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application of existing tax laws of various jurisdictions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including earnings that are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our ability to generate and use tax attributes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the federal research and development “rd” tax credit laws transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement and legal structure tax effects of nondeductible compensation including certain stockbased compensation tax costs related to intercompany realignments changes in accounting principles adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries or customers a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings or changes in tax laws and regulations including the tax act enacted on december 22 2017 and the new us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 

significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions and determine our income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect income taxes or additional paidin capital in addition tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as evidenced by the tax act as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied our income taxes may be affected recent changes to us tax laws including taxation of earnings outside of the us the introduction of a base erosion antiabuse tax and the disallowance of tax deductions for certain book expense as well as changes to us tax laws that may be enacted in the future could impact the tax treatment of our earnings as well as cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain for example the ninth circuit court of appeals or the court is expected to issue an opinion in altera corp v commissioner that addresses the treatment of stockbased compensation under a costsharing arrangement we are monitoring this case and any impact the final opinion could have on our financial statements and effective tax rate furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change 

further we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities audits by the internal revenue service or other tax authorities are subject to inherent uncertainties and could result in unfavorable outcomes including potential fines or penalties as we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions the expense of defending and resolving such an audit may be significant the amount of time to resolve an audit is also unpredictable and may divert management’s attention from our business operations we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our income taxes we cannot assure you that fluctuations in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application or interpretation of existing tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns by tax authorities will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act the listing requirements of the new york stock exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or the sarbanesoxley act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act compliance with these rules and regulations and the attendant responsibilities of management and the board may make it more difficult to attract and retain executive officers and members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee has increased our legal and financial compliance costs made some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and increased demand on our systems and resources among other things the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to maintain and if required improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard significant resources and management oversight may be required in addition if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 we could be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs pay fines settlements or judgments as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects although we have already hired additional employees to help comply with these requirements we may need to further expand our legal and finance departments in the future which will increase our costs and expenses 

in addition changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure such as continued rulemaking pursuant to the doddfrank act and related rules and regulations are creating uncertainty for public companies increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming these laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding 

compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if our efforts to comply with new laws regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business and prospects may be harmed as a result of disclosure of information in the filings required of a public company our business and financial condition will become more visible which may result in threatened or actual litigation including by competitors and other third parties if such claims are successful our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be harmed and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor these claims and the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert the resources of our management and harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in addition as a result of our disclosure obligations as a public company we will have reduced strategic flexibility and will be under pressure to focus on shortterm results which may adversely affect our ability to achieve longterm profitability we also believe that being a public company and these new rules and regulations makes it more expensive for us to obtain and maintain director and officer liability insurance and in the future we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee and qualified executive officers 

failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business is subject to regulation by various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the united states for example the european union or eu has now implemented general data protection regulation “gdpr” the gdpr requires substantial changes to the handling and storage of data and administrative fines for violations which can be up four percent of the previous year’s annual revenue or €20 million whichever is higher from time to time we may receive inquiries from such governmental agencies or we may make voluntary disclosures regarding our compliance with applicable governmental regulations or requirements relating to importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations which could lead to formal investigations noncompliance with applicable government regulations or requirements could subject us to sanctions mandatory product recalls enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages civil and criminal penalties or injunctions if any governmental sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected in addition responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls 

our products may be subject to various export controls and because we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products certain of our products may be exported from various countries only with the required export license or through an export license exception if we were to fail to comply with the applicable export control laws customs regulations economic sanctions or other applicable laws we could be subject to monetary damages or the imposition of restrictions which could be material to our business operating results and prospects and could also harm our reputation further there could be criminal penalties for knowing or willful violations including incarceration for culpable employees and managers obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities furthermore certain export control and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products technology software and services to embargoed countries and sanctioned governments entities and persons even though we take precautions to ensure that we and our channel partners comply with all relevant regulations any 

failure by us or our channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences including reputational harm government investigations and penalties 

as our company grows we also continue developing procedures and controls to comply with export control and other applicable laws historically we have had some instances where we inadvertently have not fully complied with certain export control laws but we have disclosed them to and implemented corrective actions with the appropriate government agencies 

in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including through import permit and license requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our end customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential end customers with international operations or create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we or our partners fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition results of operations prospects and reputation could be adversely affected 

we and our partners including our contract manufacturers are subject to various local state federal and international environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection recycling and disposal of electrical and electronic equipment examples of these laws and regulations include the eu restrictions on the use of hazardous substances directive or rohs directive and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive or weee directive as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the us and we or our partners including our contract manufacturers are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

the eu rohs directive and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products our products currently comply with the rohs directive however if there are future changes to this directive we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes our failure or the failure of our partners including our contract manufacturers to comply with past present and future environmental laws could result in fines penalties thirdparty claims reduced sales of our products substantial product inventory writeoffs and reputational damage any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we also expect that our business will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis applicable to us and our partners including our contract manufacturers to date our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows although we cannot predict the future effect of such laws or regulations they will likely result in additional costs or require us to change the content or manufacturing of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products 

as a public company we are subject to requirements under the doddfrank act that require us to perform diligence and disclose and report whether or not our products contain “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer’s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict minerals” 

the implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products in addition we will incur additional 

costs to comply with these disclosure requirements including costs related to conducting diligence procedures and if applicable potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities we may also face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflictfree or if we are unable to alter our products processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials 

risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock   

the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the value of your investment could decline 

the trading price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following 

 in addition technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility and if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company if the market price of our common stock is volatile we may become the target of securities litigation securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business and prospects this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that such sales might occur could reduce the market price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us 

based on shares outstanding as of december 31 2018  holders of approximately 240  of our common stock have rights subject to some conditions to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders in addition we have registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans if holders by exercising their registration rights sell large numbers of shares it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we may also issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in connection with a financing acquisition our equity incentive plans or otherwise any such issuances would result in dilution to our existing stockholders and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 

insiders have substantial control over us which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions including a change of control 

our directors executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 10 of our outstanding common stock together with their affiliates in the aggregate beneficially own approximately 232  of the outstanding shares of our common stock based on shares outstanding as of december 31 2018  as a result these stockholders if acting together could exercise a significant level of influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests this concentration of ownership may also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock or otherwise may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change of control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock 

we have not paid dividends in the past and do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared nor paid any dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases 

if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business or prospects the market price of our common stock and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock to some extent depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business or prospects we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares the market price of our common stock would likely decline if one or more of these analysts should cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which could cause the market price of our common stock or trading volume to decline 

our charter documents and delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

 in addition as a delaware corporation we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law these provisions may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time 

the issuance of additional stock in connection with financings acquisitions investments our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1000000000 shares of common stock and up to 100000000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations we may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing acquisition investment our stock incentive plans or otherwise we may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the then market price of our common stock any issuance of stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline

overview 

we are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration data centers and campuses for enterprise support our cloud networking solutions consist of our extensible operating system or eos a set of network applications and our ethernet switching and routing platforms our cloud networking solutions deliver industryleading performance scalability availability programmability automation and visibility at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was purposebuilt to be fully programmable and highly modular the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services 

we believe that cloud networks will continue to replace legacy network technologies and that our cloud networking platform addresses the large and growing cloud networking segment of data center switching which 

remains in the early stage of adoption cloud networks are subject to increasing performance requirements due to the growing number of connected devices as well as new enterprise and consumer applications computing architectures are evolving to meet the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications we expect to continue growing our organization to meet the needs of new and existing customers as they increasingly realize the performance and cost benefits of our cloud networking solutions and as they expand their cloud networks accordingly we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our rapid development of new features and applications 

we generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our eos software we generate the majority of our services revenue from post contract support or pcs which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others as we have grown the functionality of our eos software expanded the range of our product portfolio and increased the size of our sales force our revenue has continued to grow rapidly we have also been profitable and operating cash flow positive for each year since 2010 

to continue to grow our revenue it is important that we both obtain new customers and sell additional products to existing customers we expect that a substantial portion of our future sales will be followon sales to existing customers we intend to continue expanding our sales force and marketing activities in key geographies as well as our relationships with channel technology and systemlevel partners in order to reach new end customers more effectively increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support effectively in order to support our strong growth we have and may continue to accelerate our investment in infrastructure such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations 

our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our eos software and enhancements to eos we engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture today we combine our eos software with merchant silicon into a family of switching and routing products this enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions we currently procure certain merchant silicon components from multiple vendors and we continue to expand our relationships with these and other vendors we work closely with third party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third party direct fulfillment facilities we and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling final configuration quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers 

historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for significant portion of our revenue we have experienced unpredictability in the timing of large orders especially with respect to our large end customers due to the complexity of orders the time it takes end customers to evaluate test qualify and accept our products and factors specific to our end customers due to these factors we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis for example our sales to microsoft as an enduser in the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 representing 27 of our revenue during fiscal 2018 benefited from certain factors that may not repeat in fiscal 2019 or future fiscal years and the percentage of our revenue from microsoft in fiscal 2019 may decline in addition we have provided and may in the future provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers 

on august 6 2018 we entered into a binding term sheet with cisco the “term sheet” pursuant to the term sheet we paid cisco 4000 million on august 20 2018 and the company and cisco obtained dismissals of all ongoing district court and usitc litigation between us cisco granted us a release for all past claims relating to the patents cisco asserted against us in the district court and usitc and we granted cisco a release from all past antitrust and unfair competition claims these mutual releases extended to the companys and cisco’s customers contract manufacturers and partners the parties further agreed to a fiveyear standdown period for any utility patent infringement claims either may have against features currently implemented in the other party’s products and services with some carveouts for products stemming from acquired companies the parties further 

agreed to a threeyear dispute resolution process for allegations by either party against new andor modified features in the other party’s products we also agreed to make certain modifications to our command line interface “cli” on december 3 2018 the parties entered into a mutual release and settlement agreement the “definitive agreement” which superseded the term sheet but did not substantially alter the terms see note 14 legal settlement of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

revenue by geography in thousands except percentages 



revenue 

we generate revenue primarily from sales of our products we also derive a portion of our revenue from sales of pcs which is typically purchased in conjunction with our products and subsequent renewals of those contracts we expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on among other things the timing and size of orders the delivery and acceptance of products and the impact of significant transactions in addition while we expect our revenue to continue to grow in absolute dollars on a yearoveryear basis our revenue growth rates are expected to decline as our business scales 

product revenue increased 4083 million  or 285  in the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 2017  the increase was primarily driven by sales to our existing customers as they continued to expand and upgrade their cloud networks in addition our newer switch products have continued to gain market acceptance which has contributed to our revenue growth service revenue increased 969 million  or 454  in the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 2017 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base has continued to expand we continue to experience pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition but demand for our products and growth in our installed base has more than offset this pricing pressure during the period 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

cost of revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our thirdparty contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors overhead costs in our manufacturing operations department and other manufacturingrelated costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory 

cost of revenue increased 1936 million  or 331  for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 2017  the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to the corresponding increases in product revenues we expect our cost of product revenue to continue to increase as our product revenue increases cost of providing pcs and other services consists primarily of personnel costs for our global customer support organization 

gross margin or gross profit as a percentage of revenue has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing manufacturingrelated costs including costs associated with supply chain sourcing activities merchant silicon costs the mix of products sold and excessobsolete inventory writedowns including charges for excessobsolete component inventory held by our contract manufacturers 

gross margin decreased from 645  to 638  for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 2017  the decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by a decrease in product margins due to customer mix partially offset by reduced inventoryrelated charges and an improved service margins due to a relatively fixed services cost base and growing service revenues we expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above 

operating expenses in thousands except percentages 

our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing general and administrative expenses and legal settlement expense the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs personnel costs consist of wages benefits bonuses and with respect to sales and marketing expenses sales commissions personnel costs also include stockbased compensation and travel expenses we 

expect operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as we continue to invest in the growth of our business 



research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs prototype expenses thirdparty engineering and contractor support costs and an allocated portion of facility and it costs including depreciation our research and development efforts are focused on maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products and on new product development including new releases and upgrades to our eos software and applications we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership 

research and development expenses increased 929 million  or 266  for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 2017  the increase was primarily due to a 489 million  increase in personnel costs including corporate bonuses and stockbased compensation driven primarily by headcount growth from our normal hiring process and from the two acquisitions we completed in the third quarter of 2018 and a 247 million  increase in new product introduction costs driven by additional development projects in addition facility and it costs increased by 95 million  due to increased it services headcount growth and additional costs associated with our acquired businesses 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs marketing and promotional activities and an allocated portion of facility and it costs including depreciation we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide 

sales and marketing expenses increased 320 million  or 207  for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 2017  the increase primarily included a 280 million  increase in personnel costs which was driven by increased headcount as well as higher sales volumes resulting in increased compensation costs including commissions and stockbased compensation 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of cisco and optumsoft litigation related expenses personnel costs professional services fees and an allocated portion of facility and it costs including depreciation general and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive finance human resources and legal functions our professional services fees are primarily due to external legal accounting and tax services 

general and administrative expenses decreased 214 million  or 246  for the year ended december 31 2018  compared to 2017  the decrease included a 338 million  decrease that was primarily related to a reduced level of litigation activities and a decrease in bond costs as a result of the settlement of the cisco litigation in august 2018 the decrease was partially offset by 35 million  of acquisitionrelated expenses incurred in 2018 

a 33 million increase in personnel costs including increased stockbased compensation driven by increased headcount and a 31 million increase in other legal and professional fees 

legal settlement 

during the three months ended june 30 2018 we recorded 4050 million in legal settlement expenses in connection with the term sheet that was entered into on august 6 2018 between the company and cisco which included a 4000 million  payment to cisco pursuant to the term sheet and 50 million of legal fees associated with the settlement see note 14 legal settlement of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k  for further discussion 

other income expense net in thousands except percentages 

other income expense consists primarily of interest income from our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities foreign currency transaction gains and losses gains and losses on our investments in privatelyheld companies and interest expense on our lease financing obligation in connection with our adoption of asu 201601 in 2018 other income expense may fluctuate in the future as a result of the remeasurement of our private company equity investments upon the occurrence of observable price changes andor impairments see note 1 organization and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k  for details of this new guidance in addition other income expense net will also fluctuate due to changes in interest rates returns on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our foreign currency transactions 



the favorable change in other income expense net during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 2017 was driven by a 236 million increase in interest income as we continued to generate cash and expand our marketable securities portfolios which was offset partially by a 138 million net loss recorded in 2018 on our investments in privatelyheld companies see note 5 investments of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k  for further discussion 

provision for benefit from income taxes in thousands except percentages   

we operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to local country income tax and may also be subject to us income tax generally our us tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these foreign earnings which avoids double taxation our tax expense to date consists of federal state and foreign current and deferred income taxes 



for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 we recorded a benefit of 393 million  and an expense of 516 million  for income taxes respectively the change in our income taxes was largely attributable to a 969 million tax benefit on the cisco settlement in 2018 whereas we recorded a 518 million tax expense in 2017 related to the enactment of the tax act the tax act provided for a decrease in the 2018 us federal statutory tax rate but this was partially offset by a new requirement to provide us tax on foreign earnings for further information regarding income taxes and the impact on our results of operations and financial position see note 10 income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k  

our future effective tax rate is expected to be impacted by fluctuations in excess tax benefits on sharebased compensation

revenue 

product revenue increased 4415 million or 445 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 the increase was primarily driven by increased product shipments to our existing customers as they continued to expand their cloud networks in addition our newer switch products had continued to gain market acceptance which had contributed to our revenue growth service revenue increased 755 million or 548 in the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand 

we continued to experience pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition but demand for our products and growth in our installed base had more than offset this pricing pressure deferred product revenue at december 31 2017 remained consistent with the balance at december 31 2016 the deferred product revenue balance at december 31 2016 primarily included customer arrangements with new product and new customer acceptance clauses which expired during 2017 while the balance at december 31 2017 primarily 

represented arrangements with a few of our larger customers related to the then ongoing qualification activities of our 945 investigationrelated product redesigns see note 7 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k   

cost of revenue and gross margin 

cost of revenue increased 1784 million or 439 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase in product shipment volumes and the corresponding increase in product revenue gross margin increased from 640 to 645 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 the increase in gross margin was primarily driven by improved service margins as we scaled our services business on a relatively fixed cost base and slightly better product margins due to end customer mix this improvement was partially offset by an increase in excess and obsolete inventoryrelated charges as we transitioned to new products 

operating expenses in thousands except percentages 



research and development 

research and development expenses increased 760 million or 278 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 the increase was primarily due to a 369 million increase in personnel costs driven by headcount growth resulting in additional compensation costs including stockbased compensation and a 316 million increase in new product introduction costs driven by additional development projects and costs associated with litigationrelated changes in product design in addition facility and it costs increased by 53 million due to the headcount growth 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses increased 242 million or 185 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 the increase included a 154 million increase in personnel costs which was primarily due to increased headcount as well as higher sales volumes driving increased compensation costs including commissions and stockbased compensation in addition sales support costs increased by 81 million compared to 2016 reflecting increased professional services and field demonstration costs to support our sales infrastructure and expand our customer base 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses increased 116 million or 154 for the year ended december 31 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 the increase was primarily due to a 45 million increase in the cisco litigation related expenses which included bond costs associated with the importation and sale of affected products and components during the presidential review period of the 945 investigation in addition personnel costs increased by 39 million primarily due to increased stockbased compensation and higher salary related costs driven by the increased headcount 

other income expense net in thousands except percentages 



other income expense net improved during the year ended december 31 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in interest income as we continued to generate cash and expand our marketable securities portfolio 

provision for income taxes in thousands except percentages 



our provision for income taxes was approximately 516 million and 580 million for the year ended december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively which resulted in a decrease in our effective tax rate from 240 in 2016 to 109 in 2017 the reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of 1100 million of excess tax benefits on sharebased awards in the provision for income taxes as a result of our adoption of asu 201609 in 2017 combined with a favorable geographical mix of our earnings towards jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the us these positive drivers were partially offset by the inclusion of provisional tax amount totaling 518 million resulting from the recently enacted the tax act 

the tax act makes significant changes to the us tax code which include but are not limited to a us federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 and a shift to a modified territorial tax regime which requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of the cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 as of december 31 2017 we had not yet completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax act as a result we recorded a provisional tax amount of 188 million for the transition tax and a provisional tax amount of 330 million related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations as of december 31 2018  our total balance of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 20 billion  of which approximately 2941 million  was held outside the us in our foreign subsidiaries 

our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes our marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highlyrated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss we plan to continue to invest for longterm growth we believe that our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings 

our costs associated with supply chain activities including access to outsourced manufacturing our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies the continued market acceptance of our products and costs incurred related to outstanding litigation claims if we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

cash flows 



cash flows from operating activities 

our primary source of cash provided by operating activities has been cash collections from our customers we expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increased sales and timing of collections our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs inventory purchases from our contract manufacturers and suppliers investment in research and development and litigation expenses 

during the year ended december 31 2018  cash provided by operating activities was 5031 million  net of 4050 million  payments for the legal settlement with cisco including the associated legal fees our cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net income of 3281 million  noncash adjustments to net income of 714 million  and a net increase of 1036 million  in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities our operating cash benefited 705 million  from increased deferred revenue reflecting ongoing growth in service and support contracts 511 million  from decreased inventories driven by improved inventory management and timing of receipts 393 million from increased accounts payable due to timing of vendor payments primarily related to inventoryrelated purchases 214 million  from a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to decreased deposits at our contract manufacturers and 175 million  from an increase in other long term liabilities primarily driven by increased customer prepayments under cancellable contracts these favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable changes of 779 million  from increased accounts receivable due to increased billing and timing of customer shipments and 148 million  from decreased accrued liabilities due primarily to a decline in supplier liabilities and the timing of vendor accruals 

during the year ended december 31 2017 cash provided by operating activities was 6316 million primarily from net income of 4232 million with noncash adjustments to net income of 1059 million and a net increase of 1025 million in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities our operating cash benefited 1423 million from increased deferred revenue reflecting ongoing growth in service and support contracts 435 million from increased accrued liabilities driven by increased inventory purchases and product development activities and 199 million from increased income taxes payable these favorable changes were partially offset by a growth in inventory of 697 million supporting overall growth in the business and the expansion of our manufacturing and supply chain activities by a decline in accounts payable of 301 million due 

to timing of vendor payments primarily related to inventory purchases and by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 116 million primarily due to increased prepaid taxes 

during the year ended december 31 2016 cash provided by operating activities was 1743 million primarily from net income of 1842 million with noncash adjustments to net income of 586 million partially offset by a net decrease in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 684 million the decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements with accounts receivable up 1089 million inventories and inventory deposits up 2075 million and increased prepaid expenses and current assets excluding inventory deposits of 548 million which was primarily driven by an increase in deferred cost of inventory associated with increased product revenue deferrals referenced below these increases reflect substantial growth in the business and the expansion of our manufacturing and supply chain activities at our new contract manufacturer these working capital increases were partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of 1761 million reflecting ongoing growth in service and support contracts and a significant increase in product deferred revenue related to contract acceptance terms as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 693 million primarily due to timing of inventory purchases and an increase in income taxes payable of 427 million 

cash flows from investing activities 

our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases of available for sale marketable securities net of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities business acquisitions investments in privatelyheld companies and capital expenditures 

during the year ended december 31 2018  cash used in investing activities was 7551 million  consisting of purchases of marketable securities of 12 billion  offset by proceeds of 5478 million  from maturities of marketable securities 968 million for business acquisitions additional investments in privatelyheld companies of 80 million  and purchases of property equipment and other assets of 238 million  

during the year ended december 31 2017 cash used in investing activities was 3913 million  consisting of purchases of marketable securities of 5854 million purchases of property equipment and other assets of 153 million partially offset by proceeds of 2063 million from maturities of marketable securities and proceeds of 30 million from repayment of notes receivable 

during the year ended december 31 2016 cash used in investing activities was 3258 million  consisting of purchases of marketable securities of 4397 million purchases of property equipment and other assets of 214 million and an additional investment in a privatelyheld company of 25 million these decreases were partially offset by proceeds from the maturity of availableforsale securities of 1379 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities have consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under employee equity incentive plans offset by principal payments for lease financing obligations related to our headquarters facility 

during the year ended december 31 2018  cash provided by financing activities was 429 million  consisting primarily of proceeds of 537 million  from the issuance of common stock under employee equity incentive plans partially offset by 89 million  of minimum tax withheld for employees and payments of 19 million  for lease financing obligations 

during the year ended december 31 2017 cash provided by financing activities was 515 million consisting primarily of proceeds of 446 million from employee stock option exercises partially offset by 40 million of minimum tax withheld for employees and proceeds of 125 million from employee stock purchases under our espp partially offset by payments of 16 million for lease financing obligations 

during the year ended december 31 2016 cash provided by financing activities was 327 million consisting primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 249 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our espp of 103 million partially offset by payments of 13 million for lease financing obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018  we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity our contractual obligations represent material expected or contractually committed future payment obligations we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing balances of cash cash equivalent and marketable securities 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2018  in thousands 



the contractual obligation table above excludes tax liabilities of 403 million  related to uncertain tax positions and transition tax due under the tax act because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement if any of these future payments 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods we base our estimates assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements which in turn could change the results from those reported we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results our future financial statements will be affected the critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are the following 

revenue recognition   

prior to 2018 our revenue recognition policy was based on asc 605  revenue recognition “asc 605” and is described in the section entitled critical accounting policies under item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2017 filed with the sec on february 20 2018 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted the new revenue recognition guidance under asc 606 as discussed in the section titled recently adopted accounting pronouncements in note 1 organization and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k  the following is our new revenue recognition policy effective january 1 2018 

we generate revenue from sales of our products which incorporate our eos software and accessories such as cables and optics to direct customers and channel partners together with pcs we typically sell products and pcs in a single contract we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services we apply the following fivestep revenue recognition model 

 postcontract customer support 

pcs which includes technical support hardware repair and replacement parts beyond standard warranty bug fixes patches and unspecified upgrades on a whenandifavailable basis is offered under renewable feebased contracts we initially defer pcs revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the pcs contract as there is no discernable pattern of delivery related to these promises we do not provide unspecified upgrades on a set schedule and addresses customer requests for technical support if and when they arise with the related expenses recognized as incurred pcs contracts generally have a term of one  to three  years we include billed but unearned pcs revenue in deferred revenue 

contracts with multiple performance obligations 

most of our contracts with customers other than renewals of pcs contain multiple performance obligations with a combination of products and pcs products and pcs generally qualify as distinct performance obligations our hardware includes eos software which together deliver the essential functionality of our products for contracts which contain multiple performance obligations we allocate revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on the standalone selling price “ssp” judgment is required to determine the ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use a range of amounts to estimate ssp for products and pcs sold together in a contract to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various products and pcs 

if we do not have an observable ssp such as when we do not sell a product or service separately then ssp is estimated using judgment and considering all reasonably available information such as market conditions and information about the size andor purchase volume of the customer we generally use a range of amounts to estimate ssp for individual products and services based on multiple factors including but not limited to the sales channel reseller distributor or end customer the geographies in which our products and services are sold and the size of the end customer 

we limit the amount of revenue recognition for contracts containing forms of variable consideration such as future performance obligations customerspecific returns and acceptance or refund obligations we include some or all of an estimate of the related at risk consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recorded under each contract will not occur when the uncertainties surrounding the variable consideration are resolved 

most of our contracts with customers have payment terms of 30 days with some large high volume customers having terms of up to 60 days we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component because the company and the customer have specific business reasons other than financing for entering into such contracts specifically both we and our customers seek to ensure the customer has a simplified way of purchasing arista products and services 

we account for multiple contracts with a single partner as one arrangement if the contractual terms andor substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are in effect parts of a single contract 

we may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is generally no contractual provision for such returns we estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied against currentperiod shipments specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate 

our policy applies to the accounting for individual contracts however we have elected a practical expedient to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts or performance obligations with similar characteristics so long as such application would not differ materially from applying the guidance to the individual contracts or performance obligations within that portfolio consequently we have chosen to apply the portfolio approach when possible which we do not believe will happen frequently additionally we will evaluate a portfolio of data when possible in various situations including accounting for commissions rights of return and transactions with variable consideration 

we report revenue net of sales taxes we include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 

inventory valuation and contract manufacturersupplier liabilities 

inventories primarily consist of finished goods and strategic components primarily integrated circuits inventories are stated at the lower of cost computed using the firstin firstout method and net realizable value manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory we record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value 

our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts we record a liability and a corresponding charge for noncancellable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers or suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes   

we use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures these estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers product development plans and current sales levels if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities 

income taxes 

income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that we recognize for financial reporting and income tax purposes 

we account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements but have not been reflected in our taxable income estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize 

we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

we regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether and to the extent to which additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense 

loss contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are a party to claims and legal proceedings including matters relating to commercial employee relations business practices and intellectual property in assessing loss contingencies we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss we record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we will record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required

refer to “recent accounting pronouncements” in note 1 organization and summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and investments in privately held companies 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars and therefore our revenue is not directly subject to foreign currency risk however we are indirectly exposed to foreign currency risk a stronger us dollar could make our products and services more expensive in foreign countries and therefore reduce demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect such economic exposure to currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are also influenced by many other factors 

our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located which is primarily in the us and to a lesser extent in europe and asia our results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would have had a maximum impact of approximately 82 million  61 million  and 38 million  on our operating results to date foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date and do not 

enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar

as of december 31 2018 and 2017 we had cash cash equivalents and availableforsale marketable securities totaling 20 billion  and 15 billion  respectively cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in money market funds corporate bonds us agency mortgagebacked securities us treasury securities and commercial paper our primary investment objectives are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements in addition our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issuer we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the us a decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income on our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities for the year ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in overall interest rates would not have had a material impact on our interest income 

on the other hand the fair market value of our investments in fixed income securities may be adversely impacted we would incur unrealized losses on fixed income securities primarily due to higher interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase under certain circumstances if we are forced to sell our marketable securities prior to maturity we may incur realized losses in such investments however because of the conservative and shortterm nature of the investments in our portfolio a change in interest rates is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

investments in privatelyheld companies 

our nonmarketable equity investments in privatelyheld companies are recorded in “investments” in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2018 and 2017 the total carrying amount of our investments in privatelyheld companies was 303 million  and 361 million  during the year ended december 31 2018 we recorded a net loss of 138 million on certain investments prior to 2018 we did no t record any impairment losses for these investments see note 5 investments of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k  for details 

the privatelyheld companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privatelyheld companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return

 item 1 business 

we are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration data centers for enterprise support our cloud networking solutions consist of our extensible operating system or eos a set of network applications and our ethernet switching and routing platforms our cloud networking solutions deliver industryleading performance scalability availability programmability automation and visibility at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was purposebuilt to be fully programmable and highly modular the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services since we began shipping our products we have grown rapidly and according to crehan research we have achieved the second largest market share in data center 10254050100 gigabit ethernet switch ports excluding blade switching sold in 2017 we have been profitable and cash flow positive for each year since 2010 

eos supports leading cloud and virtualization solutions including vmware nsx microsoft system center openstack and other cloud management frameworks we have worked with industry leaders to define new open protocols for the virtualized data center we coauthored the vxlan protocol specification with vmware and were the first to demonstrate vxlan integration and have now expanded vxlan routing and integration 

we use standard linux as our underlying operating system providing customers with access to all linux operating system facilities this allows customers to extend our eos software with offtheshelf linux applications and a growing number of open source management tools 

eos has a highly modular architecture which allows us to prevent network outages in deployments of our cloud networking solutions this architecture also allows us to rapidly develop new features and protocols without compromising the quality of the existing code base because all of our platform products are powered by the same binary image of eos we are able to deliver these new innovations to our entire installed base with minimal disruption 

eos a software platform for network programmability and automation provides an advanced level of programmability allowing customers to take advantage of prebuilt and custom eos applications as well as integration with a wide range of technology partner solutions 

in 2015 we introduced cloudvision a networkwide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation delivering a turnkey solution for cloud networking we believe cloudvision’s abstraction of the physical network to this broader networkwide perspective allows for a more efficient approach for several operational usecases related to automation visibility management security and 3 rd  party controller integration 

we sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners since shipping our first products in 2008 our cumulative endcustomer base has grown rapidly between december 31 2011  and december 31 2017  our cumulative endcustomer base grew from approximately 1100  to over 4900  our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others our customers include six of the largest cloud services providers based on annual revenue 

industry background 

cloud computing is fundamentally changing the way it infrastructure is built and how applications are delivered in cloud computing applications are distributed across thousands of servers these servers are connected with highspeed network switches that together form a pool of resources that allows applications to be rapidly deployed and costeffectively updated cloud computing enables ubiquitous and ondemand network access to these applications from internetconnected devices including personal computers tablets and smartphones 

nearly all consumer applications today are delivered as cloud services enterprise applications are rapidly moving to the cloud as well since cloud services are easier and more cost effective to deploy scale and operate than traditional applications internet leaders like amazon ebay facebook google microsoft and yahoo pioneered the development of largescale cloud data centers in order to meet the growing demands of their users including business customers enterprises and service providers around the world are adopting cloud computing technologies in order to achieve similar performance improvements and cost reductions 

the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can be orders of magnitude higher than typical legacy data center networks therefore the networks in such cloud environments must be architected and built in a new way we refer to these nextgeneration data center networks as cloud networks cloud networks must deliver high capacity high availability and predictable performance and must be programmable to allow integration with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services 

limitations of traditional data center networks 

in our view cloud networks and legacy networks are fundamentally different in a traditional data center specific applications are installed on a small number of servers and most network traffic is servertoclient or “northsouth” traffic which results in perhaps a few terabitssecond of aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud most network traffic is servertoserver or “eastwest” traffic the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can exceed 1 petabitsecond orders of magnitude higher than that of typical legacy data center networks 

the much larger scale of cloud networks requires much higher network availability since network outages in the cloud are very expensive in terms of customer impact traditional network switches have evolved and the features and capabilities of their operating system have expanded over many years without addressing the structural deficiencies of their underlying software architectures making it difficult to achieve high network switch reliability 

some networking vendors have built products that use proprietary protocols to address the scaling needs of nextgeneration data centers however proprietary protocols are generally not acceptable to internet companies or cloud service providers because they create vendor lockin 

legacy networks are not programmable and as a result are extremely difficult to integrate with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services this lack of integration forces customers to continue to rely on time consuming errorprone manual processes that may be costprohibitive 

requirements for cloud networking 

cloud networks differ in many aspects from legacy networks including capacity performance scale availability programmability automation visibility security and cost performance the requirements for cloud networking include the following 

 our cloud networking solutions 

we are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration enterprise data centers our cloud networking platform was purposebuilt to address the functional and performance requirements for cloud networks we deliver our solutions via our industryleading 10254050100 gigabit ethernet switches and routers optimized for nextgeneration data center networks 

our cloud networking solutions consist of eos our extensible operating system a set of networking applications and our gigabit ethernet platforms at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was architected to be fully programmable and highly modular 

the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications and application programming interfaces or apis that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has further allowed us to integrate rapidly with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services 

the key benefits of our cloud networking solutions are as follows 

capacity performance and scalability 

our cloud networking platform enables data center networks to scale to hundreds of thousands of physical servers and millions of virtual machines with the least number of switching tiers we achieve this by leveraging standard protocols to meet the scale requirements 

of cloud computing we have used activeactive layer 2 and layer 3 network topologies to enable customers to build extremely large and resilient networks 

high availability 

our highly modular eos software architecture was designed to be faultisolating and selfhealing in order to deliver higher stability compared to legacy network operating systems in addition our customers can nondisruptively upgrade our switches running in the network using our smart system upgrade or ssu application 

open and programmable 

our eos software was purposebuilt to offer programmable interfaces throughout all levels of our software this has allowed us to integrate our cloud networking platform with a wide range of leading thirdparty applications for example we support vmware nsx openstack and microsoft system center for orchestration and fast provisioning enabling true workload mobility and automatic provisioning of physical switches we enable customers through application programming interfaces to write their own scripts to customize and optimize their networks in addition we support a wide range of softwaredefined network controllers via our openflow and directflow interfaces 

workflow automation 

our eos software enables enterprises to provision networking resources in minutes with no manual intervention through our zero touch provisioning we also natively support ansible cfengine chef puppet virtual network orchestration applications and thirdparty management tools cloudvision a networkwide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation delivers a turnkey solution for cloud networking cloudvision extends the same eos architectural approach across the network for state topology monitoring and visibility this enables enterprises to move to cloudclass automation without needing significant internal development finally eos embraces the devops model which is a software development method that combines development and operations to provision and monitor servers storage and network resources in a unified fashion 

network visibility 

our eos software provides a set of tools and applications that proactively monitor detect and notify network managers when network issues arise delivering realtime data to thirdparty management applications including corvil extrahop riverbed and splunk to provide detailed application visibility our telemetry applications include vm tracer which provides visibility down to the virtual machine level path tracer which detects errors in provisioned network paths mapreduce tracer which monitors and optimizes the performance of hadoop workloads and health tracer which monitors infrastructure resiliency our network visibility applications provide realtime insight into the status of the network they include lanz which monitors latency and danz 2017 a set of features previously only available in addon network visibility devices which provides advanced traffic monitoring with flow analysis and timestamps plus the ability to perform tap aggregation for reporting and analysis 

security 

macrosegmentation services mss™ is one of the services enabled via cloudvision since cloudvision maintains a networkwide database of all state within the network as well as direct integration with hypervisor resources like vmware vsphere and nsx it is aware of every workload that is within the network and it learns in real time about new devices or workloads that are added or removed from the network or moved across ports or servers macrosegmentation extends the concept of finegrained interhypervisor security to cloud networks by enabling dynamic security and services for physical to virtual workloads macrosegmentation security is a complement to finegrained security delivered via microsegmentation that is already implemented in the virtual switch of the physical host on which a vm is running 

lower total cost of ownership 

our cloud networking platform offers architectural and system advantages that provide our customers with costeffective and highly available cloud networking solutions our programmable scalable leafspine architectures combined with industryleading applications significantly reduce networking costs when compared to legacy network designs enabling faster time to service and improved availability our automation tools reduce the operational costs of provisioning managing and monitoring a data center network and speed up service delivery our visibility tools provide high levels of visibility into complex network environments without the need for additional data collection equipment as a result fewer network engineers are needed to operate large networks 

our market opportunity 

we compete primarily in the data center switching market for 10 gigabit ethernet and above excluding blade switches 

we believe that cloud computing represents a fundamental shift from traditional legacy data centers and that cloud networking is the fastest growing segment within the data center switching market as organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud architectures spending on cloud and nextgeneration data centers has increased rapidly over the last several years while traditional legacy it spending has been growing more slowly in 2017 our 7150 7050 7250 7300 and 7500 series platforms are now listed on the u s department of defense approved products lists integrated tracking system by the defense information systems agency 

our customers 

as of december 31 2017  we had delivered our cloud networking solutions to over 4900  end customers worldwide in approximately 80  countries our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others for each of the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  microsoft purchases through our channel partner world wide technology inc accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue 

our competitive strengths 

we believe the following strengths will allow us to maintain and extend our technology leadership position in cloud networking and nextgeneration data center ethernet products 

 our products and technology 

we offer one of the broadest product lines of data center 10254050100 gigabit ethernet switches and routers in the industry comprising our 70107020 series 7050x series 7060x series 7160 series 7150 series 7250x series 7260 series 7280r series universal leaf products 7300x series spline products and our 7500r series universal spine products 

we deliver routing and switching platforms with industryleading capacity low latency port density and power efficiency we have also innovated in areas such as deep packet buffers embedded optics and reversible cooling our products have been recognized with a number of awards including the best of interop grand prize that was given to our industryleading spine switch the arista 7500 series in 2010 and again to the arista 7500e series in 2013 an overview of our switchingrouting portfolio is shown in the figure below 

we use multiple silicon architectures across our products which allows us to build a broader range of products optimized for different functions in the network than competitors that utilize fewer silicon architectures while we use multiple silicon architectures all of our platforms are powered with the same binary eos image which significantly simplifies deployment and ensures the same rich feature set and consistent operation across all our products 

our extensible operating system 

the core of our cloud networking platform is our extensible operating system or eos which runs on top of standard linux and offers programmability at all layers of the stack all of our 10254050100 gigabit ethernet platforms run our eos software 

eos is based on a new and innovative architecture that is highly modular and consists of more than 100 separate processes that we call agents each one handling specific protocol processing device driver or system management functions each agent runs in user space as a separate linux process and is completely protected and isolated from all other agents 

we are constantly investing in our core infrastructure to provide the capabilities required for building modern cloud networks and enhancing scalability new requirements for use in cloud and service provider networks and hybrid cloud deployments in enterprises require ongoing upgrades and extensions to our state oriented architecture 

eos attributes 

the modular and programmable architecture of eos enables us to offer a set of attributes capabilities and features that are essential for cloud networking and nextgeneration data centers 

high availability 

eos is selfhealing in the sense that individual processes can be restarted without impacting application traffic this architectural design principle supports selfhealing resiliency in our software easier software maintenance and module independence higher software quality overall and faster timetomarket for new features that customers require 

programmable at all layers 

eos is programmable at all layers from the linux kernel to switch configuration provisioning automation and detailed monitoring of the network public cloud providers have leveraged tools such as the eos software development kit sdk and eapi to implement fully customized infrastructure automation solutions 

workflow visibility 

through eos we have developed a wide range of applications available to our customers for purchase as additional licenses that enable enhanced network monitoring and visibility without requiring additional external monitoring devices this includes i dataanalyzer danz which provides access to raw network data for analysis by security troubleshooting and performance management tools ii latencyloss analyzer lanz which provides access to internal network performance loads and packet loss and latency occurring at the microsecond level iii network telemetry which provides network state information including correlations with dynamic state of the systems operating on the network such as hypervisors distributed job controls and iv network tracers which provide active integration and diagnostics for various workload conditions dependent upon network performance 

network automation 

eos supports puppet chef and ansible which enables automatic network configuration in the same manner as servers and storage in addition eos provides tools that greatly reduce network operational costs another major component of network automation is cloud vision 

cloudvision 

cloudvision’s abstraction of the physical network to a broader networkwide perspective allows for a more efficient approach for several operational usecases including the following highlights 

 containerized eos 

arista ceos™ is a containerized packaging of eos software and its agents for deployment in cloud infrastructure with the same proven eos software image that runs on all of our products these flexible deployment options empower cloud network operators that are customizing their operating environments to provide a uniform workflow for development testing and deployment of differentiated services it enables the provisioning of a robust and proven network operating system across production and development platforms with a uniform eos distribution and singleimage consistency our customers can also utilize ceos in tandem with industry standard white box hardware and enable a wide array of tools and applications from the container ecosystem 

arista veos router 

the arista veos router is a core component of arista any cloud platform the veos router is our same proven single eos software image offered as a multicloud and multihypervisor virtual router this cloudgrade and featurerich software platform empowers enterprises and service providers to build consistent highly secure and scalable cloud networks the arista veos router is designed to support any public or hybrid cloud environment including amazon web services aws microsoft azure cloud microsoft azure stack google cloud platform and oracle cloud infrastructure 

leafspine network designs 

our customers typically deploy leafspine network topologies consisting of leaf switches or topofrack switches located in the server rack connected with uplinks to multiple loadsharing spine switches and routers that provide the backbone our leafspine network designs scale up to more than 300000 physical servers and millions of virtual machines using equal cost multiple path or ecmp to load balance layer 3 network traffic across multiple spine switches and routers with multichassis link aggregation or mlag we can build an activeactive layer 2 network that can connect more than 25000 physical servers our leafspine network designs have been widely deployed and provide predictable network bandwidth and latency a key advantage of predictable network performance is that it eliminates the need to optimize the network for specific applications which means a single network design works equally well for all applications 

enterprise resources commonly span multiple datacenters or performance optimized datacenters or pods within a data center including the public cloud the drive to deliver resources quickly affordably and reliably also drives the need for a flexible costeffective scaleout design at the datacenter core which we refer to as the “spine of spines” or universal spine the universal spine is nonblocking supports large scale ecmp ip routing and routing convergence the universal spine enables architects to build the network around the spine and collapse legacy networking layers into the universal spine 

examples of our leafspine and universal leafspine architectures are illustrated below 

any cloud platform for hybrid cloud networking 

the arista any cloud software platform is intended to reduce operational costs and complexity for enterprises by simplifying integration and management of hybrid clouds across private cloud datacenters and public cloud providers the new virtualized offering and arista veos™ router combined with cloudvision® and cloud tracer™ functionality provides consistent operations orchestration security and telemetry across multicloud environments 

the arista any cloud platform is designed to support any public or hybrid cloud environment including amazon web services aws the microsoft azure cloud platform microsoft azure stack an extension of azure google cloud platform and oracle cloud infrastructure support in each environment is coupled with validation and registration of these solutions in the cloud marketplace infrastructure provided by each cloud provider thus making deployment simple for the enterprise customer 

this platform will be further enhanced by integration with the equinix cloud exchange™ which provides direct highperformance connections to 70 cloud providers 

cloud principles migrate enterprise from pins to pics 

with the arista any cloud solution enterprise customers can now deploy a reliable and secure multicloud experience with a common universal cloud network approach across all of the placesinthecloud pics as opposed to siloed placesinthenetwork pins of the legacy enterprise this enables it organizations to harness dispersed cloud resources anywhere for better availability of services and applications across any cloud any workload and any location 

customer support and services 

we have designed our customer support offerings to provide our customers with high levels of support our global team of support engineers engages directly with client it teams and is available at all times over email by phone or through our website 

we offer multiple service options that allow our customers to select the product replacement service level that best meets their needs we stock spare parts in over 125 locations around the world through our thirdparty logistics suppliers all of our service options include unlimited access to bugfixes new featurereleases online case management and our community forums 

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our products through our direct sales force and in partnership with our channel partners including distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators and oem partners we also sell in conjunction with various technology partners to facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity we have created a partner program the arista partner program to engage partners who provide valueadded services and extend our reach into the marketplace authorized training partners perform technical training of our channel partners and end customers our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us 

and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us 

our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for presales technical support and solutions engineering for our end customers systems integrators original equipment manufacturers or oems and channel partners a pool of shared channel sales and marketing representatives also supports these teams each sales team is responsible for a geographical territory has responsibility for a number of major direct endcustomer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market we have field sales teams operating in approximately 80  countries 

our marketing activities consist primarily of technology conferences web marketing trade shows product demonstrations seminars and events public relations analyst relations demand generation and direct marketing to build our brand increase endcustomer awareness communicate our product advantages and generate qualified leads for our field sales force and channel partners 

research and development 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and features that address the needs of our end customers our inhouse engineering personnel are responsible for the development quality documentation support and release of our products we plan to continue to invest significantly in resources to conduct our research and development efforts our research and development expense was 3496 million  2736 million  and 2094 million  in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

manufacturing 

we subcontract the manufacturing of all of our products to various contract manufacturers our primary manufacturing partners are jabil circuit sanmina corporation and foxconn this approach allows us to reduce our costs manufacturing overhead and inventory position and allows us to adjust more quickly to changing endcustomer demand we require all of our manufacturing locations to be iso9001 certified our eos software is installed on our products at one of three direct fulfillment facilities 

our contract manufacturing partners procure the majority of the components needed to build our products and assemble our products according to our design specifications this allows us to leverage the purchasing power of our contract manufacturing partners we retain complete control over the bill of material test procedures and quality assurance programs our onsite personnel work closely with our partners and review on an ongoing basis forecasts inventory levels processes capacity yields and overall quality our contract manufacturing partners procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts these forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analyses from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions we update these forecasts monthly 

our products rely on key components including merchant silicon integrated circuit components and power supplies purchased from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers generally neither our contract manufacturers nor we have a written agreement with these component providers to guarantee the supply of the key components used in our products nor do we have exclusive rights to such key components our product development efforts also depend upon continued collaboration with our key suppliers including our merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors it is critical that we work in tandem with our key merchant silicon vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features this enables us to focus our research and development resources on software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions 

once the completed products are manufactured and tested our contract manufacturing partners ship them to various theatre direct fulfillment facilities in the united states the netherlands and singapore for final configuration quality control inspection and shipment to our distribution partners and end customers after the products are shipped to our end customers our products are installed by the end customers or by thirdparty service providers such as system integrators or value added resellers on their behalf 

backlog 

we do not have any longterm purchase commitments from customers customers generally order products on an asneeded basis with short lead and delivery times on a perpurchaseorder basis we maintain substantial finished goods inventory to ensure that products can generally be shipped shortly after receipt of an order a significant portion of our customer shipments in any fiscal year relate to orders received and shipped in that fiscal year our customers utilize purchase orders containing nonbinding purchase commitments and we allow customers to cancel change or reschedule orders without penalty at any time prior to shipment and as a result we do not believe backlog is firm due to the foregoing factors backlog is not a meaningful indicator in any given period of our ability to achieve any particular level of overall revenue or financial performance 

competition 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology changing endcustomer needs evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services we expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for cloud networking expands and existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products 

the data center networking market has been historically dominated by cisco systems with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including broadcombrocade dellemc hewlett packard enterprise and juniper networks most of our competitors have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example in the last few years alone  broadcom acquired brocade extreme networks purchased certain data center networking assets from broadcombrocade and avaya dell acquired force10 and emc ibm acquired blade network technology hewlett packard enterprise acquired aruba networks juniper acquired contrail and cisco acquired insieme  we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants including “whitebox” switch vendors as well as current technology partners and end customers who may develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products 

the principal competitive factors applicable to our products include 

 we believe our products compete favorably with respect to these factors our eos software offers high reliability integrates with existing network protocols and is open and programmable we believe the combination of eos a set of network applications and our 10254050100 gigabit ethernet platforms make our offering highly competitive for both cloud and enterprise data centers however many of our competitors have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger sales and marketing budgets and resources broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and end customers greater access to larger endcustomer bases greater endcustomer support resources greater manufacturing resources the ability to leverage their sales efforts across a broader portfolio of products the ability to leverage purchasing power when purchasing subcomponents the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services the ability to develop their own silicon chips the ability to set more aggressive pricing policies lower labor and development costs greater resources to make acquisitions larger intellectual property portfolios and substantially greater financial technical research and development or other resources 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our core technology and intellectual property we rely on patent trademark and copyright laws trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees end customers resellers systems integrators and others to protect our intellectual property rights we file us and foreign patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 

we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of valuable breadth or applicability in addition any patents that may be issued may be contested circumvented found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them we also license software from third parties for integration into our products including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms we also own a number of trademarks in the us and other jurisdictions including arista eos cloudvision cloudstream cvp cvx health tracer mapreduce tracer path tracer mxp mss rail score spline superspine ssu flexroute netrollback netdb osfp algomatch macrosegmentation macrosegmentation service 

we control access to and use of our software technology and other proprietary information through internal and external controls including contractual protections with employees contractors end customers and partners our software is protected by us and international copyright patent and trade secret laws despite our efforts to protect our software technology and other proprietary information unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software technology and other proprietary information in addition we intend to expand our international operations and effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights if we become more successful we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights it may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights in particular large and established companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation from time to time third parties including certain of these large companies and nonpracticing entities may assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual 

property rights against us our channel partners or our end customers whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against such claims for example in december 2014 cisco systems filed two lawsuits against us in the northern district of california for alleged patent and copyright infringement additionally cisco systems filed two complaints against us in the united states international trade commission usitc for patent infringement and the usitc has initiated an investigation please see legal proceedings included in part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of this litigation 

furthermore to comply with the limited exclusion order and cease and desist order in the 945 investigation as described in note 5 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k we have made design changes to our products for sale in the united states to address the features that were found to infringe the patent claims underlying the remedial orders in the 945 investigation we have also worked closely with our customers on the qualification and testing of our redesigned products the timing of completion of these qualification activities some of which have extended beyond the current quarter has impacted our business with these customers in these quarters we will continue to work with these customers to complete these procedures and improve these design changes with further product modifications in order to meet customer requirements 

we also filed a motion with the us court of appeals for the federal circuit the cafc requesting that it stay the orders issued by the united states international trade commission “usitc” in the 945 investigation pending completion of the appeals of the decisions of the united states patent trial and appeal board “ptab” finding invalid the claims of the patents the usitc found us to infringe in the 945 investigation on september 22 2017 the cafc denied the motion to stay but has allowed us to import our redesigned products into the united states without being blocked by the usitc’s orders subject to any determinations by the usitc in subsequent proceedings regarding the redesigned products the cafc has also granted our requests to expedite various phases of the appeals of the ptab’s decisions on october 27 2017 the usitc instituted a modification proceeding to determine whether our redesigned products infringe the patent claims underlying the remedial orders in the 945 investigation the usitc has set a deadline of five months for the administrative law judge “alj” to issue a recommended determination which may be extended by one month upon a showing of good cause the recommended determination will be subject to review by the commission after which the commission will issue a final determination the commission has not set a target date for the final determination 

successful claims of infringement by a third party if any could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services require us to expend time and money to develop noninfringing solutions or force us to pay substantial damages royalties or other fees we cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe or that we will not in the future infringe upon any thirdparty patents or other proprietary rights

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k which could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the risks described below are not the only risks facing us risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

risks related to our business and our industry 

our business and operations have experienced rapid growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected 

we have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last several years which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure our employee headcount and number of end customers have increased and we expect both to continue to grow over the next year for example between december 31 2011  and december 31 2017  our headcount grew from approximately 250  employees to approximately 1800  employees and our cumulative number of end customers grew from approximately 1100  to over 4900  as we have grown we have had to manage an increasingly large and more complex array of internal systems and processes to scale with all aspects of our business including our hardware and software development contract manufacturing purchasing logistics fulfillment and maintenance and support our success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and continue to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems we may not be able to successfully implement these or other improvements to our systems and processes in an efficient or timely manner and we may discover deficiencies in their capabilities or effectiveness we may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems and processes or in connection with thirdparty technology in addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate effectively and in the intended manner may result in disruption of our current operations and endcustomer relationships our inability to manage the growth of our business and our inability to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings and prevent certain losses 

our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and may increase the risk associated with your investment 

we shipped our first products in 2008 and the majority of our revenue growth has occurred since the beginning of 2010 our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects including our ability to plan for and model future growth we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries including the risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k if we do not address these risks successfully our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline further we have limited historical financial data and we operate in a rapidly evolving market as such any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market 

our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance 

our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance we experienced annual revenue growth rates of 458  348  and 434  in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively we may not achieve similar revenue growth rates in future periods as the size of our customer base increases we achieve higher market penetration in our current target market and we continue to enter and expand into new target markets other factors may also contribute to declines in our growth rates including changes in demand for our products and services increased competition our ability to successfully manage our expansion or continue to capitalize on growth opportunities the maturation of our business and general economic conditions you should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

our results of operations are likely to vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors or our previously issued financial guidance or if any forwardlooking financial guidance does not meet the expectation of analysts or investors the market price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our results of operations have historically varied from period to period and we expect that this trend will continue as a result you should not rely upon our past financial results for any period as indicators of future performance our results of operations in any 

given period can be influenced by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict including 

 any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of several of the factors described above may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other results of operations this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our revenue gross margins results of operations or other expectations contained in any forward looking financial guidance we have issued or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for a particular period if we fail to meet or exceed such guidance or expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our common stock could decline substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits 

the cloud networking market is rapidly evolving if this market does not evolve as we anticipate or our target end customers do not adopt our cloud networking solutions we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the growth and evolution of the cloud networking market the market demand for cloud networking solutions has increased in recent years as end customers have deployed larger more sophisticated networks and have increased the use of virtualization and cloud computing the continued growth of this market will be dependent upon many factors including but not limited to the adoption of our end customers’ products and services the expansion evolution and build out of our end customers’ networks the overcapacity of existing network infrastructures changes in the technological requirements for the products and services to be deployed in these networks the amount and mix of capital spending by our end customers the financial performance and prospects of our end customers the availability of capital resources to our end customers changes in government regulation that could impact cloud networking business models including those regulations related to cyber security privacy data protection and net neutrality our ability to provide cloud networking solutions that address the needs of end customers more effectively and economically than those of other competitors or existing technologies and general economic conditions 

if the cloud networking solutions market does not develop in the way we anticipate if our solutions do not offer benefits compared to competing networking products or if end customers do not recognize the benefits that our solutions provide then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

if we are unable to attract new large end customers or to sell additional products to our existing end customers our revenue growth will be adversely affected and our revenue could decrease 

to increase our revenue we must add new end customers and large end customers and sell additional products to existing end customers for example one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our solutions thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers we believe this opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing infrastructure and expected future spend if we fail to attract new large end customers or fail to reduce the sales cycle and sell additional products to our existing end customers our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

we expect large purchases by a limited number of end customers to continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue and any loss or delay of expected purchases could result in material quartertoquarter fluctuations of our revenue or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue particularly in the cloud networking market many of these end customers make large purchases to complete or upgrade specific data center installations and are typically made on a purchaseorder basis rather than pursuant to longterm contracts revenue from sales to microsoft through our channel partner world wide technology inc accounted for 16  16  and 12  of our revenue for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

as a consequence of the concentrated nature of our customer base and their purchasing behavior our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate changes in the business requirements or focus vendor selection project prioritization financial prospects capital resources and expenditures or purchasing behavior of our key end customers could significantly decrease our sales to such end customers or could lead to delays or cancellations of planned purchases of our products or services for example some of our end customers continue to qualify and test our redesigned products to ensure that they meet network requirements and failure to obtain such qualification or customer acceptance any cancellation of orders or any acceleration or delay in anticipated product purchases or the acceptance of shipped products by these customers could materially affect our revenue and results of operations in any quarterly period we may be unable to sustain or increase our revenue from our large end customers or offset the discontinuation of concentrated purchases by our larger end customers with purchases by new or existing end customers we expect that such concentrated purchases will continue to contribute materially to our revenue for the foreseeable future and that our results of operations may fluctuate materially as a result of such larger end customers’ buying patterns in addition we may see consolidation of our customer base such as among internet companies and cloud service providers which could result in loss of end customers the loss of such end customers or a significant delay or reduction in their purchases could materially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

some of our large end customers require more favorable terms and conditions from their vendors and may request price concessions as we seek to sell more products to these end customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenue 

our large end customers have significant purchasing power and as a result may receive more favorable terms and conditions than we typically provide to other end customers including lower prices bundled upgrades extended warranties acceptance terms indemnification terms and extended return policies and other contractual rights as we seek to sell more products to these large end customers an increased mix of our shipments may be subject to such terms and conditions which may reduce our margins or affect the timing of our revenue recognition and thus may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

we must continue to enhance our existing products and develop new technologies and products that address emerging technological trends evolving industry standards and changing endcustomer needs the process of enhancing our existing products and developing new technology is complex and uncertain and new offerings requires significant upfront investment that may not result in material design improvements to existing products or result in marketable new products or costs savings or revenue for an extended period of time if at all the success of new products depends on several factors including appropriate new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 

in addition new technologies could render our existing products obsolete or less attractive to end customers and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if such technologies are widely adopted for example end customers may prefer to address their network switch requirements by licensing software operating systems separately and placing them on industrystandard servers or develop their own networking products rather than purchasing integrated hardware products as has occurred in the server industry 

in the past several years we have announced a number of new products and enhancements to our products and services the success of our new products depends on several factors including but not limited to component costs timely completion and introduction of these products prompt solution of any defects or bugs in these products our ability to support these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 

our product releases introduced new software products that include the capability for disaggregation of our software operating systems from our hardware the success of our strategy to expand our software business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the additional development efforts and costs to create these new products or make them compatible with other technologies the potential for our strategy to negatively impact revenues and gross margins and additional costs associated with regulatory compliance 

we may not be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology or endcustomer requirements on a timely basis or at all if we fail to keep up with technology changes or to convince our end customers and potential end customers of the value of our solutions even in light of new technologies our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

to remain competitive we must successfully manage product introductions and transitions 

our ability to continue to compete effectively in a rapidly evolving market requires that we successfully release new products that meet the increasingly sophisticated networking requirements of our end customers the success of new product introductions will depend on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance of our new products our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the timely development and availability of new merchant silicon chips from our suppliers the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction for example our new product releases will require strong execution from our third party merchant silicon chip suppliers to develop and release new merchant silicon chips that satisfy endcustomer requirements to meet expected release schedules and to provide sufficient quantities of these components if we are unable to successfully manage our product introductions or transitions as a result of any of these or other factors our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

we face intense competition especially from larger wellestablished companies and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

the market for data center networking including the market for cloud networking is intensely competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants this competition could result in increased pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and our failure to increase or the loss of market share any of which would likely seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the data center networking market has been historically dominated by cisco systems with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including broadcombrocade dellemc hewlett packard enterprise and juniper networks most of our competitors have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example in the last few years alone  broadcom acquired brocade extreme networks purchased certain data center networking assets from broadcombrocade and avaya dell acquired force10 and emc ibm acquired blade network technology hewlett packard enterprise acquired aruba networks juniper acquired contrail and cisco acquired insieme  we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants including white box switch vendors as well as current technology partners and end customers who may develop network switches and cloud service solutions 

for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

 our competitors also may be able to provide end customers with capabilities or benefits different from or greater than those we can provide in areas such as technical qualifications or geographic presence or may be able to provide end customers a broader range of products services and prices in addition large competitors may have more extensive relationships with and within existing and potential end customers that provide them with an advantage in competing for business with those end customers for example certain large competitors encourage end customers of their other products and services to adopt their data networking solutions through discounted bundled product packages our ability to compete will depend upon our ability to provide a better solution than our competitors at a more competitive price we may be required to make substantial additional investments in research development marketing and sales in order to respond to competition and we cannot assure you that these investments will achieve any returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

we also expect increased competition if our market continues to expand conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or other factors current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties that have greater resources available than we do our current or potential competitors might take advantage of the greater resources of the larger organization resulting from these acquisitions to compete more vigorously or broadly with us in addition continued industry consolidation might adversely affect end customers’ perceptions of the viability of smaller and even mediumsized networking companies and consequently end customers’ willingness to purchase from those companies further certain large end customers may develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products which could allow these end customers to become new competitors in the market 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

most of our competitors have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example in the last few years alone  broadcom acquired brocade extreme networks purchased certain data center networking assets from broadcombrocade and avaya dell acquired force10 and emc ibm acquired blade network technology hewlett packard enterprise acquired aruba networks juniper acquired contrail and cisco acquired insieme  

moreover large system vendors are increasingly seeking to deliver toptobottom cloud networking solutions to end customers that combine cloudfocused hardware and software solutions to provide an alternative to our products 

we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete with us including any competitors that seek to become sole source vendors for end customers this could lead to more variability in our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are currently involved in litigation with cisco systems inc 

we are currently involved in several litigation matters with cisco systems inc these matters are summarized below

on december 9 2016 the alj issued her initial determination finding a violation of section 337 more specifically the alj found that a violation has occurred in the importation into the united states the sale for importation or the sale within the united states after importation of certain network devices related software and components thereof that the alj found infringe asserted claims 1 7 9 10 and 15 of the ’577 patent and asserted claims 1 2 4 5 7 8 10 13 19 56 and 64 of the ’668 patent the alj did not find a violation of section 337 with respect to asserted claim 2 of the ’577 patent or any asserted claims of the ’853 ’492 ’875 and ’211 patents 

on may 4 2017 the commission issued its final determination which found a violation with respect to the ’577 and ’668 patents and found no violation with respect to the ’211 ’853 ’875 and ’492 patents the commission also issued a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist order pertaining to network devices related software and components thereof that infringe one or more of claims 1 7 9 10 and 15 of the ’577 patent and 1 2 4 5 7 8 10 13 18 56 and 64 of the ’668 patent on july 4 2017 the 60day presidential review period for the 945 investigation expired during the 60day presidential review period the usitc orders permitted arista to continue importing and selling products covered by the orders so long as we paid a 5 bond because the united states trade representative did not disapprove the usitc’s final determination the limited exclusion order and cease and desist order are now in full effect 

on may 25 2017 and june 1 2017 the ptab issued final written decisions finding all claims of the ’577 and ’668 patents that we were found to have infringed in the 945 investigation unpatentable on june 1 2017 and june 2 2017 we filed emergency petitions to suspend the remedial orders in the 945 investigation on july 20 2017 the commission issued a notice denying our petition to suspend the remedial orders on july 21 2017 we filed a motion to stay the remedial orders in the 945 investigation pending disposition of the relevant appeals and sought expedited consideration of our motion on september 11 2017 the commission denied our motion to stay 

on june 30 2017 cisco filed a petition for review of the usitc’s final determination to the federal circuit regarding the ’853 ’492 ’875 and ’211 patents on july 21 2017 we filed a petition for review of the final determination to the federal circuit 

on august 25 2017 we filed a motion with the federal circuit requesting that the federal circuit stay the remedial orders pending the completion of the appeal of the 945 investigation on september 22 2017 the federal circuit issued an order denying our 

motion to stay but ordered that our redesigned products be allowed to enter the country “unless and until commission proceedings are initiated and completed to produce an enforceable determination that such a redesign is barred” by a commission remedial order 

on september 27 2017 cisco filed a petition with the usitc requesting that the commission institute a modification proceeding to determine whether our redesigned products infringe the patent claims underlying the remedial orders in the 945 investigation on october 27 2017 the commission instituted the modification proceeding the proceeding has been assigned to alj mcnamara who presided over the underlying investigation the commission has set a deadline of five months for the alj to issue a recommended determination on what if any modifications to the remedial orders issued in the 945 investigation are appropriate this deadline may be extended by one month upon a showing of good cause the recommended determination will be subject to review by the commission after which the commission will issue a final determination the commission has not set a target date for the final determination the hearing was held on january 26 2018   

inter partes reviews 

we have filed petitions for inter partes review of the ’597 ’211 ’668 ’853 ’537 ’577 ’886 and ’526 patents iprs relating to the ’597 ipr no 201500978 and ’211 ipr no 201500975 patents were instituted in october 2015 and hearings on these iprs were completed in july 2016 on september 28 2016 the ptab issued a final written decision finding claims 1 14 3942 71 72 84 and 85 of the ’597 patent unpatentable the ptab also found that claims 29 63 64 73 and 86 of the ’597 patent had not been shown to be unpatentable on october 5 2016 the ptab issued a final written decision finding claims 1 and 12 of the ’211 patent unpatentable the ptab also found that claims 2 69 13 1720 of the ’211 patent had not been shown to be unpatentable both parties have appealed the final written decisions on the ’211 and ’537 patent iprs the hearing for the ’211 ipr appeal is set for march 2018 

the ipr relating to the ’886 patent was instituted on may 25 2016 following that decision cisco agreed to dismiss its claims as to the ʼ886 patent with prejudice and we dismissed our counterclaims as to the ʼ886 patent without prejudice 

iprs relating to the ’668 ipr no 201600309 ’577 ipr no 201600303 ’853 ipr no 20160306 and ’537 ipr no 20160308 patents were instituted in june 2016 and hearings were held on march 7 2017 on may 25 2017 the ptab issued final written decisions finding claims 1 710 1216 1822 25 and 2831 of ’577 patent unpatentable and that claim 2 of the ’577 patent claim 63 of the ’853 patent and claims 1 10 19 and 21 of the ’537 patent had not been shown to be unpatentable on june 1 2017 the ptab issued a final written decision finding claims 110 1213 1528 3031 3336 5564 6667 and 6972 of the ’668 patent unpatentable we filed a notice of appeal concerning the ’577 patent on july 21 2017 and notices of appeal concerning the ‘853 and ’537 patents on july 26 2017 cisco crossappealed concerning the ’577 patent on july 26 2017 and filed a notice of appeal concerning the ’668 patent on august 1 2017 for the appeals of the iprs on the ’668 and ’577 patents the federal circuit granted our motion for an expedited briefing schedule and the hearings were held on february 9 2018 on february 14 2018 the federal circuit affirmed the ptab’s final written decision on the ’668 patent 

     

we intend to vigorously defend against each of the cisco lawsuits as summarized in the preceding paragraphs however we cannot be certain that any claims by cisco will be resolved in our favor regardless of the merit of the claims any adverse litigation ruling could result in injunctive relief and usitc remedial orders including the above described injunctive relief could lead to significant penalties assessed or damages awarded against us or a requirement that we make substantial royalty payments to cisco andor could require that we modify our products 

for example in the 944 investigation the usitc issued a limited exclusion order barring entry into the united states of our network devices including our 7000 series of switches related software and components thereof that infringe one or more of the claims of the ’537 ʼ592 and ʼ145 patents specified above and a cease and desist order restricting our activities with respect to such imported products in the 945 investigation the usitc issued a limited exclusion order barring entry into the united states of our network devices related software and components thereof that infringe one or more of the claims of the ’577 and ’668 patents specified above and a cease and desist order restricting our activities with respect to such imported products 

to comply with these orders we have sought to develop technical redesigns that no longer infringe the patents that are the subject of the orders in any efforts to develop these technical redesigns for our products we may be unable to do so in a manner that does not continue to infringe the patents or that is acceptable to our customers our redesign efforts could be extremely costly and time consuming as well as disruptive to our other development activities and distracting to management moreover our ability to import redesigned products into the united states is based on rulings from us customs and border protection “cbp” and the federal circuit while these favorable rulings currently allow us to import our redesigned products into the united states the usitc could determine in an enforcement action or modification proceeding that our redesigned products continue to infringe the patents that are the subject of any usitc orders in addition the federal circuit or cbp could decide to withdraw or alter their rulings based on a change in circumstances any failure to effectively redesign our products obtain customer acceptance of those redesigned products retain authorization to import those redesigned products or address the usitc findings in a manner that complies with the usitc orders may cause a disruption to our product shipments a rejection or return of our redesigned products by or a delay or loss of sales to customers subject us to penalties or damage awards and materially and adversely affect our business revenues prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition 

specifically in response to the usitc’s findings in the 944 investigation we have made design changes to our products for sale in the united states to address the features that were found to infringe the ’537 ’592 and ’145 patents following the issuance of the final determination in the 944 investigation we submitted a section 177 ruling request to cbp seeking approval to import these redesigned products into the united states on november 18 2016 we received a 177 ruling from cbp finding that our redesigned products did not infringe the relevant claims of the ʼ537 ’592 and ʼ145 patents and approving the importation of those redesigned products into the united states on january 13 2017 at the request of cisco and without our input cbp issued a letter to us revoking its prior november 18 ruling cbp subsequently conducted an inter partes proceeding between arista and cisco to determine whether our redesigned products infringe and whether to approve them for importation into the united states on april 7 2017 following the inter partes proceeding cbp again ruled that our redesigned products do not infringe the relevant claims of the ’537 ’592 and ’145 patents and again approved those redesigns for importation into the united states on september 12 2017 cisco filed a second request with cbp seeking to revoke our approval to import our redesigns relating to the 944 investigation we have opposed cisco’s request and cbp has not yet ruled on cisco’s request 

similarly on may 4 2017 the usitc issued a limited exclusion order and cease and desist order in the 945 investigation with respect to the ’668 and ’577 patents we have made design changes to our products for sale in the united states to address the features that were found to infringe the ’577 and ’668 patents we are making ongoing modifications to our products to also ensure that they continue to meet customer requirements and we are working with our customers to qualify those modified products for use in our customers’ networks in particular the ’577 patent was directed to a feature that is implemented in the merchant silicon chips that we purchase from thirdparty suppliers because we do not design build or manufacture these merchant silicon chips we are limited in further modifications that we can make to our products for this patent our redesign efforts therefore consisted of removing the feature found to infringe the ’577 patent in all of our products until this patent expires on june 30 2018 and providing an alternative feature to address the ‘577 patent for a subset of those products the redesign and qualification efforts to address the 945 investigation findings could be extremely costly and time consuming for us and our customers as well as disruptive to our other development activities and distracting to management we may not be able to complete and our customers may not be able to qualify these redesigned products in a timely fashion if at all for example some of our customers continue to test and qualify our redesigned products which address the ’577 and ’668 patents to ensure that they meet their network requirements this could result in a delay or cancellation of purchases by some customers until the redesigned products are qualified or accepted by such customers a rejection or return of our redesigned products by some customers or a loss of sales to some customers who are unable to qualify or accept the redesigned products any of which could materially and adversely affect our business revenues deferred revenue balances prospects reputation results of operations or financial condition 

because the usitc did not suspend its orders in the 945 investigation despite a ptab finding that every relevant claim of the ’668 and ’577 patents is unpatentable we were barred from importing our redesigned products into the united states until we received approval from cbp on july 21 2017 we submitted a part 177 request to cbp seeking approval to import our redesigned products into the united states following the federal circuit’s order on september 22 2017 allowing us to import our redesigned products we withdrew our request on october 12 2017 cbp over cisco’s objection terminated the part 177 proceedings and confirmed that it will permit entry of our redesigns pursuant to the federal circuit’s september 22 2017 order 

in either the 944 enforcement action or the 945 modification proceeding if the usitc determines that our redesigned products infringe any of the patents that are the subject of usitc remedial orders those redesigned products will also be barred from import into the united states or sale after importation in addition the usitc may impose the maximum statutory civil penalties for violation of the cease and desist order “including monetary sanctions for each day’s violation of the cease and desist order of the greater of 100000 or twice the domestic value of the articles entered or sold whichever is higher” bring a civil action in us district court “requesting collection of such civil penalties and the issuance of a mandatory injunction preventing further violation of cease and desist order” or impose “such other remedies and sanctions as are appropriate and within the commission’s authority” in the 944 enforcement action the alj recommended a civil penalty of 307 million if the commission were to reverse the alj’s finding of no violation any such finding by the usitc in either the 944 enforcement action or the 945 modification proceeding could materially and adversely affect our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition 

an adverse finding in the 944 enforcement action or the 945 modification proceeding would take effect immediately upon usitc’s issuance of the final determination without any presidential review period to address such a finding we would have to further redesign our products to make them noninfringing and until we made such changes we would not be able to import or ship our products to customers our further redesign efforts could be extremely costly and time consuming as well as disruptive to our other development activities and distracting to management we may not be able to further redesign the products in a manner that does not continue to infringe the patents or that is acceptable to customers we may not be able to complete and our customers may not be able to qualify such further redesigned products in a timely fashion if at all following the issuance of an adverse final determination leading to a delay or cancellation of purchases by some customers until those redesigned products are qualified or accepted by such customers a rejection or return of our redesigned products by some customers or a loss of sales to some customers who are unable to qualify or accept the redesigned products our redesign efforts could be extremely costly and time consuming as well as disruptive to our other development activities and distracting to management 

for example in the 944 enforcement action although the alj issued an initial determination finding that our redesigned products did not violate the june 23 2016 cease and desist order if the alj modifies the initial determination during the remand proceeding or if the commission finds a violation in its final determination on september 4 2018 we will no longer be able to import or ship our products in the us until we make further changes to address those findings which could materially and adversely affect our business revenues prospects reputation results of operations or financial condition we would also need to obtain usitc or cbp approval to resume importation of such redesigned products into the united states in addition the usitc would not provide a service and support exception for our previously redesigned products and customers may be required to upgrade to new products to obtain service and support if we are unable to obtain such approvals or provide such service and support exception our business prospects reputation results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in addition if we are found to have violated the usitc’s orders while those orders remain in effect we may be subject to the penalties described above 

in the 945 modification proceeding while the usitc orders are based upon patent claims that the ptab has found to be invalid these orders will remain in effect unless and until the ptab decisions are affirmed on appeal and the united states patent and trademark office pto cancels the patents or the patents expire if the commission finds a violation in its final determination for the 945 modification proceeding we will no longer be able to import or ship our products in the us until we make further changes to address those findings andor until the ptab decisions are so affirmed and the pto cancels the patents or the patents expire which could materially and adversely affect our business revenues prospects reputation results of operations or financial condition we would also need to obtain usitc or cbp approval to resume importation of any such redesigned products into the united states in addition the usitc would not provide a service and support exception for our previously redesigned products and customers may be required to upgrade to new products to obtain service and support if we are unable to obtain such approvals or provide such service and support exception our business revenues prospects reputation results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in light of the federal circuit’s february 14 2018 ruling affirming the ptab’s invalidity findings on the ’668 patent we plan to seek a stay of the itc’s remedial orders as they relate to the ’668 patent if our motion is denied we would continue to be subject to the itc’s remedial orders on the ’668 patent until all appeals have been fully resolved in our favor and the claims cancelled by the pto we may not prevail on this appeal in a timely manner if at all in addition even if the ptab decisions are ultimately affirmed on appeal and the patent claims are canceled if we are found to have violated the usitc’s orders while those orders remain in effect we may be subject to the penalties described above 

to comply with the usitc’s remedial orders we have also made certain changes to our manufacturing importation and shipping workflows these changes have included shifting manufacturing and integration of our products to be sold in the united states to us facilities such changes may be extremely costly time consuming and we may not be able to implement such changes successfully any failure to successfully change our manufacturing and importation processes or shipping workflows in a manner that is compliant with the usitc’s limited exclusion orders and cease and desist orders may cause a disruption in our product shipments and materially and adversely affect our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition 

in connection with these changes to the extent that we are required to make further modifications to our supply chain to obtain alternative us sources for subcomponents we may be unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner if at all which could delay or halt entirely production of our products or require us to make further modifications to our products to incorporate new components that are available in the united states any of these events could result in lost sales reduced gross margins or damage to our endcustomer relationships which would materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

additionally the existence of ciscoʼs lawsuits against us could cause concern among our customers and partners and could adversely affect our business and results of operations many of our customers and partners require us to indemnify and defend them against third party infringement claims and pay damages in the case of adverse rulings these claims could harm our relationships with our customers or channel partners cause them to delay or defer purchasing decisions or deter them from doing business with us from time to time we may also be required to provide additional assurances beyond our standard terms whether or not we prevail in the lawsuit we expect that the litigation will be expensive timeconsuming and a distraction to management in operating our business 

we are currently involved in a license dispute with optumsoft inc 

on april 4 2014 optumsoft filed a lawsuit against us in the superior court of california santa clara county titled optumsoft inc v arista networks inc  in which it asserts i ownership of certain components of our eos network operating system pursuant to the terms of a 2004 agreement between the companies and ii breaches of certain confidentiality and use restrictions in that agreement under the terms of the 2004 agreement optumsoft provided us with a nonexclusive irrevocable royaltyfree license to software delivered by optumsoft comprising a software tool used to develop certain components of eos and a runtime library that is incorporated into eos the 2004 agreement places certain restrictions on our use and disclosure of the optumsoft software and gives optumsoft ownership of improvements modifications and corrections to and derivative works of the optumsoft software that we develop 

in its lawsuit optumsoft has asked the court to order us to i give optumsoft access to our software for evaluation by optumsoft ii cease all conduct constituting the alleged confidentiality and use restriction breaches iii secure the return or deletion of optumsoft’s alleged intellectual property provided to third parties including our customers iv assign ownership to optumsoft of optumsoft’s alleged intellectual property currently owned by us and v pay optumsoft’s alleged damages attorney’s fees and costs of the lawsuit 

david cheriton one of our founders and a former member of our board of directors who resigned from our board of directors on march 1 2014 and has no continuing role with us is a founder and we believe the largest stockholder and director of optumsoft the 2010 david r cheriton irrevocable trust dated july 28 2010 a trust for the benefit of the minor children of mr cheriton is one of our largest stockholders 

on april 14 2014 we filed a crosscomplaint against optumsoft in which we assert our ownership of the software components at issue and our interpretation of the 2004 agreement among other things we assert that the language of the 2004 agreement and the parties’ long course of conduct support our ownership of the disputed software components we ask the court to declare our ownership of those software components all similarlysituated software components developed in the future and all related intellectual property we also assert that even if we are found not to own certain components such components are licensed to us under the terms of the 2004 agreement however there can be no assurance that our assertions will ultimately prevail in litigation on the same day we also filed an answer to optumsoft’s claims as well as affirmative defenses based in part on optumsoft’s failure to maintain the confidentiality of its claimed trade secrets its authorization of the disclosures it asserts and its delay in claiming ownership of the software components at issue we have also taken additional steps to respond to optumsoft’s allegations that we improperly used andor disclosed optumsoft confidential information while we believe we have meritorious defenses to these allegations we believe we have i revised our software to remove the elements we understand to be the subject of the claims relating to improper use and disclosure of optumsoft confidential information and made the revised software available to our customers and ii removed information from our website that optumsoft asserted disclosed optumsoft confidential information 

the parties tried phase i of the case relating to contract interpretation and application of the contract to certain claimed source code in september 2015 on december 16 2015 the court issued a proposed statement of decision following phase 1 trial and on january 8 2016 optumsoft filed objections to that proposed statement of decision on march 23 2016 the court issued a final statement of decision following phase i trial in which it agreed with and adopted our interpretation of the 2004 agreement and held that we and not optumsoft own all the software at issue in phase i the remaining issues that were not addressed in the phase i trial are set to be tried in phase ii including the application of the court’s interpretation of the 2004 agreement as set forth in the final statement of decision following phase i trial to any other source code that optumsoft claims to own following a review phase ii was previously scheduled to be tried in april 2016 however that trial date has been vacated and a new trial date has not yet been set 

we intend to vigorously defend against any claims brought against us by optumsoft however we cannot be certain that if litigated any claims by optumsoft would be resolved in our favor for example if it were determined that optumsoft owned components of our eos network operating system we would be required to transfer ownership of those components and any related intellectual property to optumsoft if optumsoft were the owner of those components it could make them available to our competitors such as through a sale or license an adverse litigation ruling could result in a significant damages award against us and injunctive relief in addition optumsoft could assert additional or different claims against us including claims that our license from optumsoft is invalid 

managing the supply of our products and product components is complex insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing the supply of our products and product components is complex and our inventory management systems and related supplychain visibility tools may not enable us to forecast accurately and manage effectively the supply of our products and product components furthermore ongoing cisco litigation before the usitc and any adverse ruling that results from such litigation could cause disruption to our supplychain or with our suppliers which may impact our revenues business and reputation for example in the 944 investigation the usitc has issued a limited exclusion order barring entry into the united states of our network devices including our 7000 series of switches related software and components thereof that infringe one or more of the claims of the ʼ537 ʼ592 and ʼ145 patents specified above and a cease and desist order restricting our activities with respect to such imported products similarly in the 945 investigation the usitc has issued a limited exclusion order barring entry into the united states of our network devices including our 7000 series of switches related software and components thereof that infringe one or more of the claims of the ʼ577 and ‘668 patents specified above and a cease and desist order restricting our activities with respect to such imported products each of these remedial orders could prevent us from importing products or components into the us or using inventory to satisfy us demand andor may cause us to writedown such inventory which could reduce our gross margins 

to the extent that we are required to obtain alternative us sources for these components we may be unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner if at all sales of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products any of these events could result in lost sales reduced gross margins or damage to our endcustomer relationships which would materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

insufficient supply and inventory may result in increased lead times for our products lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply from time to time we may issue purchase orders for components and products that are noncancelable and nonreturnable we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our component inventory suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or for products that are considered obsolete in addition we establish a liability and reimburse our contract 

manufacturer for component inventory purchased on our behalf that has been rendered excess or obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders or in cases where inventory levels greatly exceed our demand forecasts 

supply management remains an increased area of focus as we balance the need to maintain sufficient supply levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of obsolescence or the end of life of certain products if we ultimately determine that we have excess supply we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins we record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value 

alternatively insufficient supply levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential end customers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available additionally any increases in the time required to manufacture our products or ship products could result in supply shortfalls if we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

because some of the key components in our products come from sole or limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers and may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

our products rely on key components including integrated circuit components and power supplies that our contract manufacturers purchase on our behalf from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers generally we do not have guaranteed supply contracts with our component suppliers and our suppliers could delay shipments prioritize shipments to other vendors or cease manufacturing such products or selling them to us at any time for example in the past we have experienced shortages in inventory for dynamic random access memory integrated circuits and delayed releases of the next generation of chipset which delayed our production andor the release of our new products the development of alternate sources for those components is timeconsuming difficult and costly 

additionally litigation in the usitc could materially impact our supply of key components including for example merchant silicon chips that we purchase from our thirdparty suppliers for example in the 944 investigation the usitc has issued a limited exclusion order barring entry into the united states of our network devices including our 7000 series of switches related software and components thereof that infringe one or more of the claims of the ʼ537 ʼ592 and ʼ145 patents specified above and a cease and desist order restricting our activities with respect to such imported products the usitc has also issued a limited exclusion order in the 945 investigation barring entry into the united states of our network devices including our 7000 series of switches related software and components thereof that infringe one or more of the claims of the ʼ577 and ‘668 patents specified above and a cease and desist order restricting our activities with respect to such imported products if we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner or if we are unable to obtain alternative sources for these components sales of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products any of these events could result in lost sales reduced gross margins or damage to our endcustomer relationships which would adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our reliance on component suppliers also yields the potential for their infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property rights with respect to components which may be incorporated into our products we may not be indemnified by such component suppliers for such infringement or misappropriation claims any litigation for which we do not receive indemnification could require us to incur significant legal expenses in defending against such claims or require us to pay substantial royalty payments or settlement amounts that would not be reimbursed by our component suppliers 

our product development efforts are also dependent upon our continued collaboration with our key merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors it is critical that we work in tandem with our key merchant silicon vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features this enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions 

if our key merchant silicon vendors do not continue to collaborate in such a fashion if they do not continue to innovate or if there are delays in the release of their products our own product launches could be delayed which could have a material effect on revenue and business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in the event of a shortage or supply interruption from our component suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner further longterm supply and maintenance obligations to end customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in addition our component suppliers change their selling prices frequently in response to market trends including industrywide increases in demand and because we do not have contracts with these suppliers we are susceptible to price fluctuations related to raw materials and components if we are unable to pass component price increases along to our end customers or maintain stable pricing our gross margins could be adversely affected and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

because we depend on thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping endcustomer orders on time if at all or on a costeffective basis which may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

we depend on thirdparty contract manufacturers to manufacture our product lines a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to these thirdparty contract manufacturers our reliance on these thirdparty contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process quality assurance product costs and product supply and timing which exposes us to risk to the extent that our products are manufactured at facilities in foreign countries we may be subject to additional risks associated with complying with local rules and regulations in those jurisdictions our reliance on contract manufacturers also yields the potential for their infringement of third party intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of our products or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of other customers’ products if we are unable to manage our relationships with our thirdparty contract manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers suffer delays or disruptions or quality control problems in their operations experience increased manufacturing lead times capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our end customers would be severely impaired and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be seriously harmed 

our contract manufacturers typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual orders we do not have longterm contracts with our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular pricing terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements which could result in supply shortages and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice for example a competitor could place large orders with the thirdparty manufacturer thereby utilizing all or substantially all of such thirdparty manufacturer’s capacity and leaving the manufacturer little or no capacity to fulfill our individual orders without price increases or delays or at all our contract with one of our contract manufacturers permits it to terminate the agreement for convenience subject to prior notice requirements we may not be able to develop alternate or second contract manufacturers in a timely manner 

if we add or change contract manufacturers or change any manufacturing plant locations within a contract manufacturer network we would add additional complexity and risk to our supply chain management and may increase our working capital requirements ensuring a new contract manufacturer or new plant location is qualified to manufacture our products to our standards and industry requirements could take significant effort and be time consuming and expensive for example we have added sanmina as an additional contract manufacturer any such addition or change in manufacturers may be extremely costly time consuming and we may not be able to do so successfully 

in addition we may be subject to additional significant challenges in ensuring that quality processes and costs among other issues are consistent with our expectations and those of our customers a new contract manufacturer or manufacturing location may not be able to scale its production of our products at the volumes or quality we require this could also adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers which could damage our customer relationships and cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end customers late delivery penalties delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins this could also result in increased levels of inventory subjecting us to increased excess and obsolete charges that could have a negative impact on our operating results 

we have expanded our contract manufacturing capabilities to include sanmina as an additional contract manufacturer which will increase our working capital requirements and the risks noted above apply to this new contract manufacturer no assurance can be given that this contract manufacturer will continue to successfully qualify and scale production of our products in the volumes or quality that we require if a usitc limited exclusion order issued in connection with the cisco litigation bars entry of our products into the united states and we are unable to obtain the necessary approvals to resume the importation of our redesigned products we would become reliant upon us manufacturing to continue to supply our products to our us customers any failure to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers could damage our customer relationships and cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end customers late delivery penalties delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins 

any production interruptions or disruptions for any reason including those noted above as well as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages adverse results from intellectual property litigation or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would adversely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

product quality problems defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate advanced technologies including both hardware and software technologies despite testing prior to their release our products may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in analyzing correcting or redesigning the products cause us to lose significant end customers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

from time to time we have had to replace certain components of products that we had shipped and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs including failures in software protocols or defective component batches resulting in reliability issues in such products and we may be required to do so in the future we may also be required to provide full replacements or refunds for such defective products we cannot assure you that such remediation would not have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects please see “our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects” 

reliance on or delays in shipments could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

we may be subject to supply chain delays or endcustomer buying patterns in which a substantial portion of sales orders and shipments may occur in the second half of each quarter this places significant pressure on order review and processing supply chain management manufacturing inventory and quality control management shipping and trade compliance to ensure that we have properly forecasted supply purchasing manufacturing capacity inventory and quality compliance and logistics if there is any significant interruption in these critical functions it could result in delayed order fulfillment adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

we base our inventory requirements on our forecasts of future sales if these forecasts are materially inaccurate we may procure inventory that we may be unable to use in a timely manner or at all 

we and our contract manufacturers procure components and build our products based on our forecasts these forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products which are in turn based on historical trends and analyses from our sales and marketing organizations adjusted for overall market conditions and other factors to the extent our forecasts are materially inaccurate or if we otherwise do not need such inventory we may under or overprocure inventory and such inaccuracies in our forecasts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the sales prices of our products and services may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our results of operations 

the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts a change in our mix of products and services the introduction of new products and services by us or by our competitors including the adoption of “white box” solutions promotional programs product and related warranty costs or broader macroeconomic factors in addition we have provided and may in the future provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers 

we have experienced declines in sales prices for our products competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and services additionally although we generally price our products worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may adversely affect actual prices that partners and end customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles decreased sales prices for any reason may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our result of operations 

sales of our 7000 series of switches generate most of our product revenue and if we are unable to continue to grow sales of these products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

historically we have derived substantially all of our product revenue from sales of our 7000 series of switches and we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future we have experienced declines in sales prices for our products including our 10 gigabit ethernet modular and fixed switches a decline in the price of our 7000 series of switches and related services or our inability to increase sales of these products would harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects more seriously than if we derived significant revenue from a larger variety of product lines and services our future financial performance will also depend upon successfully developing and selling nextgeneration versions of our 7000 series of switches if we fail to deliver new products new features or new releases that end customers want and that allow us to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

our ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings and our failure to offer highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

once our products are deployed within our end customers’ networks our end customers depend on our support organization and our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products highquality support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products if we or our channel partners do not assist our end customers in deploying our products effectively do not succeed in helping our end customers resolve postdeployment issues quickly or do not provide adequate ongoing support it could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing end customers and could harm our reputation with potential end customers in addition as we expand our operations internationally our support organization will face additional challenges including those associated with 

delivering support training and documentation in languages other than english our failure or the failure of our channel partners to maintain highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on end customers renewing their maintenance and support contracts any decline in maintenance renewals could harm our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we typically sell our products with maintenance and support as part of the initial purchase and a portion of our annual revenue comes from renewals of maintenance and support contracts our end customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance and support contracts after the expiration of the initial period and they may elect not to renew their maintenance and support contracts to renew their maintenance and support contracts at lower prices through alternative channel partners or to reduce the product quantity under their maintenance and support contracts thereby reducing our future revenue from maintenance and support contracts if our end customers especially our large end customers do not renew their maintenance and support contracts or if they renew them on terms that are less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

seasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations 

we operate on a december 31st year end and believe that there are significant seasonal factors which may cause sequential product revenue growth to be greater for the second and fourth quarters of our year than our first and third quarters we believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors including the procurement budgeting and deployment cycles of many of our end customers our rapid historical growth may have reduced the impact of seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date as our increasing size causes our growth rate to slow seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are unable to increase market awareness of our company and our products our revenue may not continue to grow or may decline 

we have not yet established broad market awareness of our products and services market awareness of our value proposition and products and services will be essential to our continued growth and our success particularly for the service provider and large enterprise markets if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful in creating market awareness of our company and our products and services then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth 

if we are unable to hire retain train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel particularly software engineering and sales personnel competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense especially in the san francisco bay area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have to provide more attractive compensation packages and other amenities research and development personnel are aggressively recruited by startup and growth companies which are especially active in many of the technical areas and geographic regions in which we conduct product development in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the hightechnology industry job candidates often consider the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to attract motivate or retain key employees if we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel or if there are delays in hiring required personnel our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be seriously harmed 

also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that such personnel has been improperly solicited that such personnel has divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that former employers own certain inventions or other work product such claims could result in litigation please see “we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us” 

we employ a number of foreign nationals who are required to obtain visas and entry permits in order to legally work in the united states and other countries the united states has recently increased the level of scrutiny in granting h1b l1 and other business visas and the current administration has indicated that immigration reform is a priority our compliance with united states immigration and labor laws could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain skilled professionals 

our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations our employment arrangements with our employees do not require that they continue to work for us for any specified period and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of our key personnel including jayshree ullal our chief executive officer andy bechtolsheim our founder and chief development officer kenneth duda our founder chief technology officer and svp software engineering anshul sadana our chief customer officer or other members of our senior management team sales and marketing team or engineering team or any difficulty 

attracting or retaining other highly qualified personnel in the future could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we do not effectively expand and train our direct sales force we may be unable to add new end customers or increase sales to our existing end customers and our business will be adversely affected 

we depend on our direct sales force to obtain new end customers and increase sales with existing end customers as such we have invested and will continue to invest in our sales organization in recent periods we have been adding personnel and other resources to our sales function as we focus on growing our business entering new markets and increasing our market share and we expect to incur additional expenses in expanding our sales personnel in order to achieve revenue growth there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training retaining and integrating sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth particularly in international markets new hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect and we may be unable to hire retain or integrate into our corporate culture sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business in addition because we continue to grow rapidly a large percentage of our sales force is new to our company if we are unable to hire integrate and train a sufficient number of effective sales personnel or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new end customers or increasing sales to our existing endcustomer base our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected 

we are subject to a number of risks associated with the expansion of our international sales and operations 

our ability to grow our business and our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide we have a limited history of marketing selling and supporting our products and services internationally operating in a global marketplace we are subject to risks associated with having an international reach and requirements such as compliance with applicable anticorruption laws 

one such applicable anticorruption law is the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and its employees and intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business securing an advantage and directing business to another and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors officers employees agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives as such if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation governmental authorities in the us and elsewhere could seek to impose civil andor criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions failure to comply with anticorruption and antibribery laws such as the fcpa and the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 or the uk bribery act and similar laws associated with our activities outside the us could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences we intend to increase our international sales and business and as such the risk of violating laws such as the fcpa and uk bribery act increases 

additionally the us government has adopted broader sanctions and embargoes that generally forbid supplying many items to or involving certain countries territories governments legal entities and individuals including restrictions imposed by the us and eu on exports to russia and ukraine we have implemented systems to detect and prevent sales into these countries or to prohibit entities or individuals but we are necessarily dependent in part on our thirdparty suppliers and distributors to implement these systems we cannot assure you that these systems will always be effective or that our suppliers and distributors effectively implement our systems to detect and prevent such sales without our prior knowledge and we may incur additional unexpected costs or expenses to comply with applicable trade restrictions 

as a result of our international reach we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or to recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the us and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in endcustomer contracts although to date we generally have not done so to the extent that we may enter into endcustomer contracts in the future that include nonstandard terms related to payment warranties or performance obligations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 



 these and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenue and consequently materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects expanding our existing international operations and entering into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial commitments our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit our future growth or materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in addition the uk’s decision to initiate an exit process from the eu known as brexit has caused uncertainty in the global markets if implemented brexit will take some period of time to complete and could result in significant regulatory changes in both the uk and the eu that could impact our business because we conduct business in the eu including the uk any of the effects of brexit could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results financial condition and cash flows 

if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

assessing our processes procedures and staffing in order to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes many of which are done manually and are dependent upon individual data input or review these processes include but are not limited to calculating revenue inventory costs and the preparation of our statement of cash flows while we continue to automate our processes and enhance our review controls to reduce the likelihood for errors we expect that for the foreseeable future many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error 

in the past we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and we cannot give assurance that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future the existence of one or more material weaknesses could preclude a conclusion by management that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting the existence or disclosure of any such material weakness could adversely affect our stock price 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology and network infrastructure spending may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology network connectivity and access to data and applications weak domestic or global economic conditions fear or anticipation of such conditions or a reduction in information technology and network infrastructure spending even if economic conditions improve could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our distributors reduced unit sales and lower or no growth for example the global macroeconomic environment could be negatively affected by among other things instability in the global credit markets the impact and uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy the instability in the geopolitical environment as a result of the united kingdom “brexit” decision to withdraw from the european union economic challenges in china and ongoing us and foreign governmental debt concerns such challenges have caused and are likely to continue to cause uncertainty and instability in local economies and in global financial markets particularly if any future sovereign debt defaults or significant bank failures or defaults occur market uncertainty and instability in europe or asia could intensify or spread further particularly if ongoing stabilization efforts prove insufficient continuing or worsening economic instability could adversely affect spending for it network infrastructure systems and tools continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may also affect the overall demand for our products although we do not believe that our business financial condition results of operations and prospects have been significantly adversely affected by economic and political uncertainty in europe asia or other countries to date deterioration of such conditions may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in the future a prolonged period of economic uncertainty or a downturn may also significantly affect financing markets the availability of capital and the terms and conditions of financing arrangements including the overall cost of financing as well as the 

financial health or creditworthiness of our end customers circumstances may arise in which we need or desire to raise additional capital and such capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 

from time to time in addition to the litigation involving cisco systems inc and optumsoft inc described elsewhere in these risk factors we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent copyright commercial product liability employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims in addition to governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources cause us to incur significant expenses or liability andor require us to change our business practices because of the potential risks expenses and uncertainties of litigation we may from time to time settle disputes even where we have meritorious claims or defenses by agreeing to settlement agreements because litigation is inherently unpredictable we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

for more information regarding the litigation in which we are currently involved see the “legal proceedings” subheading in in note 5 commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k incorporated herein by reference 

assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights or other lawsuits asserted against us could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network infrastructure industry and have resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies many companies in the network infrastructure industry including our competitors and other third parties as well as nonpracticing entities own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us from time to time they have or may in the future also assert such claims against us our end customers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties for example we are currently parties to certain litigation involving cisco systems inc and optumsoft inc described elsewhere in these risk factors 

as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur claims of infringement misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase any claim of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim distract our management from our business and require us to cease use of such intellectual property in addition some claims for patent infringement may relate to subcomponents that we purchase from third parties if these third parties are unable or unwilling to indemnify us for these claims we could be substantially harmed 

the patent portfolios of most of our competitors are larger than ours this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent crosslicenses in addition future assertions of patent rights by third parties and any resulting litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection we cannot assure you that we are not infringing or otherwise violating any thirdparty intellectual property rights 

the thirdparty asserters of intellectual property claims may be unreasonable in their demands or may simply refuse to settle which could lead to expensive settlement payments prolonged periods of litigation and related expenses additional burdens on employees or other resources distraction from our business supply stoppages and lost sales 

an adverse outcome of a dispute including those lawsuits described under the “legal proceedings” subheading in note 5 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k may require us to pay substantial damages or penalties including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party’s patents cease making licensing using or importing into the us products or services that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others expend additional development resources to attempt to redesign our products or services or otherwise to develop noninfringing technology which may not be successful enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or intellectual property rights and indemnify our partners and other third parties any damages penalties or royalty obligations we may become subject to as a result of an adverse outcome and any thirdparty indemnity we may need to provide could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects royalty or licensing agreements if required or desirable may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures further there is little or no information publicly available concerning market or fair values for license fees which can lead to overpayment of license or settlement fees in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us suppliers subject to thirdparty intellectual property claims also may choose or be forced 

to discontinue or alter their arrangements with us with little or no advance notice to us any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in the event that we are found to infringe any third party intellectual property we could be enjoined or subject to other remedial orders that would prohibit us from making licensing using or importing into the us such products or services in order to resume such activities with respect to any affected products or services we or our component suppliers would be required to develop technical redesigns to this third party intellectual property that no longer infringe the third party intellectual property in any efforts to develop technical redesigns for these products or services we or our component suppliers may be unable to do so in a manner that does not continue to infringe the third party intellectual property or that is acceptable to our customers these redesign efforts could be extremely costly and time consuming as well as disruptive to our other development activities and distracting to management moreover such redesigns could require us to obtain approvals from the court or administrative body to resume the activities with respect to these affected solutions we may not be successful in our efforts to obtain such approvals in a timely manner or at all any failure to effectively redesign our solutions or to obtain timely clearance from the court or administrative body may cause a disruption to our product shipments and materially and adversely affect our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition 

our standard sales contracts contain indemnification provisions requiring us to defend our end customers against thirdparty claims including against infringement of certain intellectual property rights that could expose us to losses which could seriously harm our business financial conditions results of operations and prospects 

under the indemnification provisions of our standard sales contracts we agree to defend our end customers and channel partners against thirdparty claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights which may include patents copyrights trademarks or trade secrets and to pay judgments entered on such claims for example we are currently involved in ongoing cisco litigation claims before the usitc an adverse ruling in such litigation may potentially expose us to claims in the event that claims are brought against our customers based on the ruling and we are required to indemnify such customers 

our exposure under these indemnification provisions is frequently limited to the total amount paid by our end customer under the agreement however certain agreements include indemnification provisions that could potentially expose us to losses in excess of the amount received under the agreement any of these events including claims for indemnification could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights 

we depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology we rely on trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection 

the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner we may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions further we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims to the extent that additional patents are issued from our patent applications which is not certain they may be contested circumvented or invalidated in the future moreover the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages and as with any technology competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future in addition we rely on confidentiality or license agreements with third parties in connection with their use of our products and technology there is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements or that we will be able to adequately enforce our rights in part because we rely on “shrinkwrap” licenses in some instances 

we have not registered our trademarks in all geographic markets failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our ability to enforce and defend our trademark rights and result in indemnification claims further any claim of infringement by a third party even those claims without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claim could divert management attention from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property in certain geographic markets 

despite our efforts the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the united states 

detecting and protecting against the unauthorized use of our products technology and proprietary rights is expensive difficult and in some cases impossible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources either of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and there is no guarantee that we would be successful furthermore many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to protecting their technology or intellectual property rights than we do accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property which could result in a substantial loss of our market share 

we rely on the availability of licenses to thirdparty software and other intellectual property 

many of our products and services include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties and we otherwise use software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties in our business this exposes us to risks over which we may have little or no control for example a licensor may have difficulties keeping up with technological changes or may stop supporting the software or other intellectual property that it licenses to us also it will be necessary in the future to renew licenses expand the scope of existing licenses or seek new licenses relating to various aspects of these products and services or otherwise relating to our business which may result in increased license fees these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms if at all in addition a third party may assert that we or our end customers are in breach of the terms of a license which could among other things give such third party the right to terminate a license or seek damages from us or both the inability to obtain or maintain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain or maintain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in releases of products and services and could otherwise disrupt our business until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and services or otherwise in the conduct of our business moreover the inclusion in our products and services of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis may limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software that we use if we combine our software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release portions of the source code of our software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products moreover we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products will be effective if we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products on terms that are not economically feasible to reengineer our products to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available in source code form our proprietary code any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products must interoperate with operating systems software applications and hardware that is developed by others and if we are unable to devote the necessary resources to ensure that our products interoperate with such software and hardware we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening demand for our products 

generally our products comprise only a part of the data center and must interoperate with our end customers’ existing infrastructure specifically their networks servers software and operating systems which may be manufactured by a wide variety of vendors and original equipment manufacturers or oems our products must comply with established industry standards in order to interoperate with the servers storage software and other networking equipment in the data center such that all systems function efficiently together we depend on the vendors of servers and systems in a data center to support prevailing industry standards often these vendors are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are also some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our end customers 

in addition when new or updated versions of these software operating systems or applications are introduced we must sometimes develop updated versions of our software so that our products will interoperate properly we may not accomplish these development efforts quickly costeffectively or at all these development efforts require capital investment and the devotion of engineering resources if we fail to maintain compatibility with these systems and applications our end customers may not be able to adequately utilize our products and we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening in demand for our products among other consequences which would adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we provide access to our software and other selected source code to certain partners which creates additional risk that our competitors could develop products that are similar to or better than ours 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our internally developed technology which is incorporated in the source code for our products we seek to protect the source code design code documentation and other information relating to our software under trade secret patent and copyright laws however we have chosen to provide access to selected source code of our software to several of our partners for codevelopment as well as for open application programming interfaces or apis formats and protocols though we generally control access to our source code and other intellectual property and enter into confidentiality or license agreements 

with such partners as well as with our employees and consultants this combination of procedural and contractual safeguards may be insufficient to protect our trade secrets and other rights to our technology our protective measures may be inadequate especially because we may not be able to prevent our partners employees or consultants from violating any agreements or licenses we may have in place or abusing their access granted to our source code improper disclosure or use of our source code could help competitors develop products similar to or better than ours 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and to be adversely affected by numerous factors 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and the gross margins we have achieved in recent years may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected in the future by numerous factors including 

 we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenues and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term as a result a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results and operating margin from quarter to quarter failure to sustain or improve our gross margins reduces our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense as a result our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly 

the timing of our sales and revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of our products’ sales cycles a sales cycle is the period between initial contact with a prospective end customer and any sale of our products endcustomer orders often involve the purchase of multiple products these orders are complex and difficult to complete because prospective end customers generally consider a number of factors over an extended period of time before committing to purchase the products and solutions we sell end customers especially in the case of our large end customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision and require considerable time to evaluate test and qualify our products prior to making a purchase decision and placing an order the length of time that end customers devote to their evaluation contract negotiation and budgeting processes varies significantly our products’ sales cycles can be lengthy in certain cases especially with respect to our prospective large end customers during the sales cycle we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities and make investments in evaluation equipment all of which lower our operating margins particularly if no sale occurs even if an end customer decides to purchase our products there are many factors affecting the timing of our recognition of revenue which makes our revenue difficult to forecast for example there may be unexpected delays in an end customer’s internal procurement processes particularly for some of our larger end customers for which our products represent a very small percentage of their total procurement activity there are many other factors specific to end customers 

that contribute to the timing of their purchases and the variability of our revenue recognition including the strategic importance of a particular project to an end customer budgetary constraints and changes in their personnel 

even after an end customer makes a purchase there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase for example the sale of our products may be subject to acceptance testing in connection with our efforts to redesign our products to address the usitc’s orders in the 945 investigation some of our customers continue to qualify and test our redesigned products to ensure that they meet network requirements in addition the significance and timing of our product enhancements and the introduction of new products by our competitors may also affect end customers’ purchases for all of these reasons it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed the particular period in which a sale will be completed or the period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized if our sales cycles lengthen our revenue could be lower than expected which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release they have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our end customers’ willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our products could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our products could result in claims by end customers for losses that they sustain if end customers make these types of claims we may be required or may choose for endcustomer relations or other reasons to expend additional resources in order to address the problem we may also be required to repair or replace such products or provide a refund for the purchase price for such products liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale and those of our resellers and distributors may not be enforceable under some circumstances or may not fully or effectively protect us from endcustomer claims and related liabilities and costs including indemnification obligations under our agreements with end customers resellers and distributors the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in expenditures of funds in connection with litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

levels or types of insurance coverage purchased may not adequately cover claims or liabilities 

we maintain insurance to protect against certain types of claims associated with the use of our products operations property damage casualty and other risks but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover all claims or penalties depending on our assumptions regarding level of risk availability cost and other considerations we purchase differing amounts of insurance from time to time and in various locations our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and policy limits that may require us to selfinsure certain types of claims or claims in certain countries if our level of insurance is inadequate or a loss isn’t covered by insurance we could be required to pay unpredictable and substantial amounts that could have a substantial negative impact on our financial results or operations   

in addition to our own direct sales force we rely on distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers to sell our products and our failure to effectively develop manage or prevent disruptions to our distribution channels and the processes and procedures that support them could cause a reduction in the number of end customers of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon maintaining our relationships with distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers and establishing additional sales channel relationships we anticipate that sales of our products to a limited number of channel partners will continue to account for a material portion of our total product revenue for the foreseeable future we provide our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our products but these steps may not be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services if we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive programs for our channel partners we may not be able to incentivize these partners to sell our products to end customers these partners may have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our products altogether one of our channel partners could elect to consolidate or enter into a strategic partnership with one of our competitors which could reduce or eliminate our future opportunities with that channel partner our agreements with our channel partners may generally be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice we may be unable to retain these channel partners or secure additional or replacement channel partners the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners requires extensive training and any new or expanded relationship with a channel partner may take several months or more to achieve productivity 

where we rely on the channel partners for sales of our products we may have little or no contact with the ultimate users of our products that purchase through such channel partners thereby making it more difficult for us to establish brand awareness ensure proper delivery and installation of our products service ongoing endcustomer requirements estimate endcustomer demand and respond to evolving endcustomer needs in addition our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to end customers fail to 

comply with their contractual obligations or violate laws or our corporate policies if we fail to effectively manage our existing sales channels or if our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our products if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of highquality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

we anticipate increasing our sales efforts to us and foreign federal state and local governmental end customers in the future sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we have attained revised certifications government demand and payment for our products and services may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects selling to government entities may also require us to comply with various regulations that are not applicable to sales to nongovernment entities including regulations that may relate to pricing classified material and other matters complying with such regulations may also require us to put in place controls and procedures to monitor compliance with the applicable regulations that may be costly or not possible we are not currently certified to perform work under classified contracts with government entities failure to comply with any such regulations could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government ceasing to buy our products and services a reduction of revenue fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the us government may require certain products that it purchases to be manufactured in the us and other relatively highcost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet these requirements any of these and other circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we may invest in or acquire other businesses which could require significant management attention disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we may make investments in complementary companies products or technologies which could involve licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in or acquisitions of other companies however we do not have significant experience in making investments in other companies nor have we made any acquisitions to date and as a result our ability as an organization to evaluate andor complete investments or acquire and integrate other companies products or technologies in a successful manner is unproven we may not be able to find suitable investment or acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete such investments or acquisitions on favorable terms if at all if we do complete investments or acquisitions we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and any investments or acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end customers investors and securities analysts 

in addition investments and acquisitions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures for example if we are unsuccessful at integrating any acquisitions or retaining key talent from those acquisitions or the technologies associated with such acquisitions into our company the business financial condition results of operations and prospects of the combined company could be adversely affected any integration process may require significant time and resources and we may not be able to manage the process successfully we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel or accurately forecast the financial effects of an acquisition transaction including accounting charges we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such investment or acquisition each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations moreover if the investment or acquisition becomes impaired we may be required to take an impairment charge which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock 

if we needed to raise additional capital to expand our operations invest in new products or for other corporate purposes our failure to do so on favorable terms could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future if we did need to raise additional funds to expand our operations invest in new products or for other corporate purposes we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms if at all if we raise additional equity financing our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our common stock could decline furthermore if we engage in debt financing the holders of such debt would have priority over the holders of common stock and we may be required 

to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or impose other restrictions on our business we may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders including maintaining specified liquidity or other ratios any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms if at all we may not be able to among other things 

 our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as described in part ii item 7 of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities equity revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition inventory valuation and contract manufacturersupplier liabilities income taxes and loss contingencies if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions our results of operations may be adversely affected and may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

we are exposed to the credit risk of our channel partners and some of our end customers which could result in material losses   

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with standard payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the us we monitor individual endcustomer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the end customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts we are unable to recognize revenue from shipments until the collection of those amounts becomes reasonably assured any significant delay or default in the collection of significant accounts receivable could result in an increased need for us to obtain working capital from other sources possibly on worse terms than we could have negotiated if we had established such working capital resources prior to such delays or defaults any significant default could adversely affect our results of operations and delay our ability to recognize revenue 

a material portion of our sales is derived through our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers some of our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers may experience financial difficulties which could adversely affect our collection of accounts receivable distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other systems integrators valueadded resellers and end customers distributors represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be less likely to have the reserve resources required to meet payment obligations our exposure to credit risks of our channel partners may increase if our channel partners and their end customers are adversely affected by global or regional economic conditions one or more of these channel partners could delay payments or default on credit extended to them either of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening us dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our end customers outside of the us which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase our product and operating costs in foreign locations further an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the us is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates if we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with the currency fluctuations our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

our corporate headquarters and the operations of our key manufacturing vendors logistics providers and partners as well as many of our customers are located in areas exposed to risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis including the san francisco bay area japan and taiwan a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake tsunami fire or a flood or other catastrophic event such as a disease outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our or their business which could in turn materially affect our financial condition results of operations and prospects for example in the event our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed which could result in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter further if a natural disaster occurs in a region from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue end customers in that region may delay or forego purchases of our products which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturer logistics providers partners or end customers or the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end any disruption in the business of our manufacturer logistics providers partners or end customers that affects sales at the end of our quarter could have a particularly significant adverse effect on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if our disaster recovery plans and those of our manufacturers logistics providers or partners prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of endcustomer orders or delays in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected 

breaches of our cybersecurity systems could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services to our customers delay our ability to recognize revenue compromise the integrity of our software products result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property damage our reputation expose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data 

we increasingly depend upon our it systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or that of our website and misappropriate our proprietary information or cause interruptions of our service because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system we have also outsourced a number of our business functions to thirdparties including our manufacturers logistics providers and cloud service providers and our business operations also depend in part on the success of these third parties own cybersecurity measures similarly we rely upon distributors resellers and system integrators to sell our products and our sales operations depend in part on the reliability of their cybersecurity measures additionally we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our it resources in safe and secure fashion that does not expose our network systems to security breaches and the loss of data accordingly if our cybersecurity systems and those of our contractors fail to protect against unauthorized access sophisticated cyber attacks and the mishandling of data by our employees and contractors our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways including 

 should any of the above events occur we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our customers and regulatory actions from governmental agencies in addition our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised and our reputation and competitive position could be significantly harmed also the regulatory and contractual actions litigations investigations fines penalties and liabilities relating to data breaches that result in losses of personally identifiable or credit card information of users of our services can be significant in terms of fines and reputational impact and necessitate changes to our business operations that may be disruptive to us additionally we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and remediate damages consequently our financial performance and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we believe our longterm value as a company will be greater if we focus primarily on growth instead of profitability 

our business strategy is to focus primarily on our longterm growth as a result our profitability in any given period may be lower than it would be if our strategy was to maximize shortterm profitability expenditures on research and development sales and 

marketing infrastructure and other such investments may not ultimately grow our business prospects or cause long term profitability for example in order to support our strong growth we have accelerated our investment in infrastructure such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations as a result we expect our levels of operating profit could decline in the short to medium term if we are ultimately unable to achieve or maintain profitability at the level anticipated by analysts and our stockholders the market price of our common stock may decline 

we may not generate positive returns on our research and development investments 

developing our products is expensive and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  our research and development expenses were 3496 million  or approximately 212  of our revenue 2736 million  or approximately 242  of our revenue and 2094 million  or approximately 250  of our revenue respectively we expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts by investing in research and development we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity we expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these investments these investments may take several years to generate positive returns if ever 

changes in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application of existing tax laws of various jurisdictions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including earnings that are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our ability to generate and use tax attributes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the federal research and development rd” tax credit laws transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement and legal structure tax effects of nondeductible compensation including certain stockbased compensation tax costs related to intercompany realignments changes in accounting principles adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries or customers a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings or changes in tax laws and regulations including the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act enacted on december 22 2017 and the new us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 

significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions and determine our provision for income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital in addition tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as evidenced by the tax act as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied our provision for income taxes may be affected recent changes to us tax laws including taxation of earnings outside of the us the introduction of a base erosion antiabuse tax and the disallowance of tax deductions for certain book expense as well as changes to us tax laws that may be enacted in the future could impact the tax treatment of our earnings as well as cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change 

further we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities audits by the internal revenue service or other tax authorities are subject to inherent uncertainties and could result in unfavorable outcomes including potential fines or penalties as we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions the expense of defending and resolving such an audit may be significant the amount of time to resolve an audit is also unpredictable and may divert management’s attention from our business operations we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we cannot assure you that fluctuations in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application or interpretation of existing tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns by tax authorities will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act the listing requirements of the new york stock exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or the sarbanesoxley act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act compliance with these rules and regulations and the attendant responsibilities of management and the board may make it more difficult to attract and retain executive officers and members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee has increased our legal and financial compliance costs made some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and increased demand on our systems and resources among other things the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to maintain and if required 

improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard significant resources and management oversight may be required in addition if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 we could be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs pay fines settlements or judgments as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects although we have already hired additional employees to help comply with these requirements we may need to further expand our legal and finance departments in the future which will increase our costs and expenses 

in addition changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure such as continued rulemaking pursuant to the doddfrank act and related rules and regulations are creating uncertainty for public companies increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming these laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if our efforts to comply with new laws regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business and prospects may be harmed as a result of disclosure of information in the filings required of a public company our business and financial condition will become more visible which may result in threatened or actual litigation including by competitors and other third parties if such claims are successful our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be harmed and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor these claims and the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert the resources of our management and harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in addition as a result of our disclosure obligations as a public company we will have reduced strategic flexibility and will be under pressure to focus on shortterm results which may adversely affect our ability to achieve longterm profitability we also believe that being a public company and these new rules and regulations makes it more expensive for us to obtain and maintain director and officer liability insurance and in the future we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee and qualified executive officers 

failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business is subject to regulation by various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the united states for example the european union enacted the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which will be enforced starting in may 2018 the gdpr requires substantial changes to the handling and storage of data and administrative fines for violations which can be up four percent of the previous year’s annual revenue or €20 million whichever is higher from time to time we may receive inquiries from such governmental agencies or we may make voluntary disclosures regarding our compliance with applicable governmental regulations or requirements relating to importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations which could lead to formal investigations noncompliance with applicable government regulations or requirements could subject us to sanctions mandatory product recalls enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages civil and criminal penalties or injunctions if any governmental sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected in addition responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls 

our products may be subject to various export controls and because we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products certain of our products may be exported from various countries only with the required export license or through an export license exception if we were to fail to comply with the applicable export control laws customs regulations economic sanctions or other applicable laws we could be subject to monetary damages or the imposition of restrictions which could be material to our business operating results and prospects and could also harm our reputation further there could be criminal penalties for knowing or willful violations including incarceration for culpable employees and managers obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities furthermore certain export control and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products technology software and services to embargoed countries and sanctioned governments entities and persons even though we take precautions to ensure that we and our channel partners comply with 

all relevant regulations any failure by us or our channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences including reputational harm government investigations and penalties 

as our company grows we also continue developing procedures and controls to comply with export control and other applicable laws historically we have had some instances where we inadvertently have not fully complied with certain export control laws but we have disclosed them to and implemented corrective actions with the appropriate government agencies 

in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including through import permit and license requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our end customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential end customers with international operations or create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we or our partners fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition results of operations prospects and reputation could be adversely affected 

we and our partners including our contract manufacturers are subject to various local state federal and international environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection recycling and disposal of electrical and electronic equipment examples of these laws and regulations include the european union or eu restrictions on the use of hazardous substances directive or rohs directive and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive or weee directive as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the us and we or our partners including our contract manufacturers are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

the eu rohs directive and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products our products currently comply with the rohs directive however if there are future changes to this directive we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes our failure or the failure of our partners including our contract manufacturers to comply with past present and future environmental laws could result in fines penalties thirdparty claims reduced sales of our products substantial product inventory writeoffs and reputational damage any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we also expect that our business will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis applicable to us and our partners including our contract manufacturers to date our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows although we cannot predict the future effect of such laws or regulations they will likely result in additional costs or require us to change the content or manufacturing of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products 

as a public company we are subject to requirements under the doddfrank act that require us to perform diligence and disclose and report whether or not our products contain “conflict minerals” mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer’s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict minerals” 

the implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements including costs related to conducting diligence procedures and if applicable potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities we may also face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflictfree or if we are unable to alter our products processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials 

risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock   

the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the value of your investment could decline 

the trading price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following 

 in addition technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility and if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company if the market price of our common stock is volatile we may become the target of securities litigation securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business and prospects this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that such sales might occur could reduce the market price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us 

based on approximately 737 million  shares outstanding as of december 31 2017  holders of approximately 247  of our common stock have rights subject to some conditions to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders in addition we have registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans if holders by exercising their registration rights sell large numbers of shares it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we may also issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in connection with a financing acquisition our equity incentive plans or otherwise any such issuances would result in dilution to our existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

insiders have substantial control over us which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions including a change of control 

our directors executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 10 of our outstanding common stock together with their affiliates in the aggregate beneficially own approximately 238  of the outstanding shares of our common stock   based on shares outstanding as of december 31 2017  as a result these stockholders if acting together could exercise a significant level of influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests this concentration of ownership may also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock or otherwise may have the effect of delaying preventing or 

deterring a change of control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock 

we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared nor paid any dividends on our common stock we intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and prospects and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases 

if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business or prospects the market price of our common stock and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock to some extent depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business or prospects we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares the market price of our common stock would likely decline if one or more of these analysts should cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which could cause the market price of our common stock or trading volume to decline 

our charter documents and delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

 in addition as a delaware corporation we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law these provisions may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time 

the issuance of additional stock in connection with financings acquisitions investments our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1000000000 shares of common stock and up to 100000000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations we may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing acquisition investment our stock incentive plans or otherwise we may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the then market price of our common stock any issuance of stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline

overview 

we are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration data centers for enterprise support our cloud networking solutions consist of our extensible operating system or eos a set of network applications and our ethernet switching and routing platforms our cloud networking solutions deliver industryleading performance scalability availability programmability automation and visibility at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was purposebuilt to be fully programmable and highly modular the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services 

we believe that cloud networks will continue to replace legacy network technologies and that our cloud networking platform addresses the large and growing cloud networking segment of data center switching which remains in the early stage of adoption cloud networks are subject to increasing performance requirements due to the growing number of connected devices as well as new enterprise and consumer applications computing architectures are evolving to meet the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications we expect to continue growing our organization to meet the needs of new and existing customers as they increasingly realize the performance and cost benefits of our cloud networking solutions and as they expand their cloud networks accordingly we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our rapid development of new features and applications 

we generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our eos software we generate the majority of our services revenue from post contract support or pcs which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others as we have grown the functionality of our eos software expanded the range of our product portfolio and increased the size of our sales force our revenue has continued to grow rapidly we have also been profitable and operating cash flow positive for each year since 2010 

to continue to grow our revenue it is important that we both obtain new customers and sell additional products to existing customers we expect that a substantial portion of our future sales will be followon sales to existing customers we intend to continue expanding our sales force and marketing activities in key geographies as well as our relationships with channel technology and systemlevel partners in order to reach new end customers more effectively increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support effectively in order to support our strong growth we have and may continue to accelerate our investment in infrastructure such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations 

our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our eos software and enhancements to eos we engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture today we combine our eos software with merchant silicon into a family of switching and routing products this enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions 

we currently procure certain merchant silicon components from multiple vendors and we continue to expand our relationships with these and other vendors we work closely with third party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third party direct fulfillment facilities we and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling final configuration quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers 

historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for significant portion of our revenue we have experienced unpredictability in the timing of large orders especially with respect to our large end customers due to the complexity of orders the time it takes end customers to evaluate test qualify and accept our products and factors specific to our end customers due to these factors we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis in addition we have provided and may in the future provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers 

furthermore to comply with the limited exclusion order and cease and desist order in the 945 investigation as described in note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k entitled commitments and contingencies we have made design changes to our products for sale in the united states to address the features that were found to infringe the patent claims underlying the remedial orders in the 945 investigation we have also worked closely with our customers on the qualification and testing of our redesigned products the timing of the completion of these qualification activities for a few of our larger customers has extended beyond year end and this has impacted our business we continue to work with these customers to complete these procedures and improve the redesigns in order to meet customer requirements we will need to complete any outstanding product modifications and qualification and acceptance processes for these customers and any inability to do so in a timely manner may result in an impact to our business our revenue and our deferred revenue balances 

we also filed a motion with the us court of appeals for the federal circuit the cafc requesting that they stay the orders of the united states international trade commission “usitc” pending completion of the appeals of the decisions of the united states patent trial and appeal board “ptab” and sought an expedited schedule for those appeals on september 22 2017 the cafc denied the motion to stay but has allowed us to import its redesigned products into the united states without being blocked by the usitc’s orders subject to any determinations by the usitc in subsequent proceedings regarding the redesigned products on october 27 2017 the usitc instituted a modification proceeding to determine whether our redesigned products infringe the patent claims underlying the remedial orders in the 945 investigation the usitc has set a deadline of five months for the alj to issue a recommended determination which may be extended by one month upon a showing of good cause the recommended determination will be subject to review by the commission after which the commission will issue a final determination the commission has not set a target date for the final determination the hearing was held on january 26 2018 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes historical results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of revenue for those periods we have derived the data for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  from our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k in thousands except for percentages of revenue 



1  includes stockbased compensation expense as follows 





year ended december 31 2017 compared to year ended december 31 2016 

revenue cost of revenue and gross profit in thousands except percentages 

revenue by geography in thousands except percentages 



revenue 

we generate revenue primarily from sales of our products we also derive a portion of our revenue from sales of pcs which is typically purchased in conjunction with our products and subsequent renewals of those contracts we expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on among other things the timing and size of orders the delivery and acceptance of products and the impact of significant transactions with unique terms and conditions that may require deferral of revenue 

product revenue increased 4415 million  or 445  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 2016  the increase was primarily driven by increased product shipments to our existing customers as they continued to expand their businesses in addition our newer switch products have continued to gain market acceptance which has contributed to our revenue growth service revenue increased 755 million  or 548  in the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 2016 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand 

we continue to experience pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition but demand for our products and growth in our installed base has more than offset this pricing pressure deferred product revenue at december 31 2017 remained consistent with the balance at december 31 2016 the deferred product revenue balance at december 31 2016 primarily included customer arrangements with new product and new customer acceptance clauses which expired during the current year while the balance at december 31 2017 primarily represents arrangements with a few of our larger customers related to the ongoing qualification activities of our 945 investigationrelated product redesigns as we enter 2018 we expect to continue to work with these customers to complete their qualification activities which may impact our business 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

cost of revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our thirdparty contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors overhead costs in our manufacturing operations department and other manufacturingrelated costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory we expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases cost of providing pcs and other services consists primarily of personnel costs for our global customer support organization 

gross margin or gross profit as a percentage of revenue has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing manufacturingrelated costs including costs associated with supply chain sourcing activities merchant silicon costs the mix of products sold and excessobsolete inventory writedowns including charges for excessobsolete component inventory held by our contract manufacturers we expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above and others 

cost of revenue increased 1784 million  or 439  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the same period in 2016  the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase in product shipment volumes and the corresponding increase in product revenue gross margin increased from 640  to 645  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the same period in 2016  the increase in gross margin was primarily driven by improved service margins as we scaled our services business on a relatively fixed cost base and slightly better product margins due to end customer mix this improvement was partially offset by an increase in excess and obsolete inventoryrelated charges as we transition to new products 

operating expenses in thousands except percentages 

our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs personnel costs consist of wages benefits bonuses and with respect to sales and marketing expenses sales commissions personnel costs also include stockbased compensation and travel expenses we expect operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as we continue to invest in the growth of our business 



research and development 

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs prototype expenses thirdparty engineering and contractor support costs and an allocated portion of facility and it costs including depreciation our research and development efforts are focused on maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products and on new product development including new releases and upgrades to our eos software and applications we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute 

dollars as we continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership 

research and development expenses increased 760 million  or 278  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the same period in 2016  the increase was primarily due to a 369 million  increase in personnel costs driven by headcount growth resulting in additional compensation costs including stockbased compensation and a 316 million  increase in prototype and thirdparty engineering costs driven by additional outsourced development projects and costs associated with litigationrelated changes in product design in addition facility and it costs increase by 53 million  due to the headcount growth 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs marketing and promotional activities and an allocated portion of facility and it costs including depreciation we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide 

sales and marketing expenses increased 242 million  or 185  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the same period in 2016  the increase included a 154 million  increase in personnel costs which was primarily due to increased headcount as well as higher sales volumes driving increased compensation costs including commissions and stockbased compensation in addition sales support costs increased by 81 million  compared to 2016 reflecting increased professional services and field demonstration costs to support our sales infrastructure and expand our customer base 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of cisco and optumsoft litigation related expenses personnel costs professional services fees and an allocated portion of facility and it costs including depreciation general and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive finance human resources and legal functions our professional services fees are primarily due to external legal accounting and tax services we expect our general and administrative expenses to fluctuate in absolute dollars from period to period depending on the timing and progress of our litigation activities 

general and administrative expenses increased 116 million  or 154  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared to the same period in 2016  the increase was primarily due to a 45 million  increase in the cisco litigation related expenses which included bond costs associated with the importation and sale of affected products and components during the presidential review period of the 945 investigation in addition personnel costs increased by 39 million  primarily due to increased stockbased compensation and higher salary related costs driven by increased headcount 

other income expense net in thousands except percentages 

other income expense consists primarily of interest income from our cash equivalents and marketable securities foreign currency transaction gains and losses and interest expense on our lease financing obligation we expect our interest income to grow in 2018 as we continue to grow our cash balance and invest our excess cash in marketable securities we expect our foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 



other income expense net improved during the year ended december 31 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to an increase in interest income as we continued to generate cash and expand our marketable securities portfolio 

provision for income taxes in thousands except percentages 

we operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to us income tax generally our us tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these earnings which avoids double taxation our tax expense to date consists of federal state and foreign current and deferred income taxes 



our provision for income taxes was approximately 516 million  and 580 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively which resulted in a decrease in our effective tax rate from 240 in 2016 to 109 in 2017 the reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of 1100 million  of excess tax benefits on sharebased awards in the provision for income taxes as a result of our adoption of asu 201609 in 2017 combined with a favorable geographical mix of our earnings towards jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the us these positive drivers were partially offset by the inclusion of provisional tax amount totaling 518 million  resulting from the recently enacted tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” 

the tax act makes significant changes to the us tax code which include but are not limited to a us federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 and a shift to a modified territorial tax regime which requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of the cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2017 as of december 31 2017 we had not yet completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax act as a result we recorded a provisional tax amount of 188 million  for the transition tax and a provisional tax amount of 330 million  related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future 

we will continue to refine our estimates related to the impact of the tax act during the one year measurement period allowed under staff accounting bulletin 118 “sab 118” in addition our future effective tax rate is anticipated to fluctuate as a result of excess tax benefits to be included in the income tax provision 

year ended december 31 2016 compared to year ended december 31 2015 

revenue cost of revenue and gross profit in thousands except percentages 

revenue by geography in thousands except percentages 



revenue 

product revenue increased 2465 million or 331 in the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 2015 the increase during the period was primarily driven by increased shipments to our existing customers as they continue to grow and expand their businesses increasing their demand for our products and related accessories the introduction of new products contributed to our revenue growth both with existing and new customers service revenue increased 487 in the year ended december 31 2016 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand we also continued to experience 

pressure in product and service pricing due to competitive market conditions however this pricing pressure was more than offset by the increased demand drivers outlined above 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

cost of revenue increased 1120 million or 381 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase in product shipment volumes in addition we incurred increased costs as we added capacity to our manufacturing and operations infrastructure gross margin decreased from 649 to 640 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 the decrease during the period was primarily the result of changes in customer mix as we expanded our business including increased contributions from larger customers who typically receive higher discount levels and increased costs associated with the expansion of manufacturing and operations capacity these unfavorable changes were partially offset by improved service margins as we scale our services business 

operating expenses in thousands except percentages 



research and development 

research and development expenses increased 641 million or 306 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 312 million resulting from an increase in compensation costs including stockbased compensation and corporate bonus expense primarily driven by headcount growth prototype spend and thirdparty engineering and consulting costs increased by 273 million related to additional outsourced development projects increased internal development activity related to new products and increased costs associated with litigationrelated changes in product design facilities and it infrastructure costs increased 31 million primarily due to continued expansion and support of our research and development activities 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses increased 218 million or 200 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 210 million reflecting increased compensation costs including sales incentive compensation and corporate bonus expense primarily driven by headcount growth and higher sales volumes in addition sales and customer engineering consulting expenses mostly related to international expansion increased by 13 million and marketing promotion trade shows and events increased by 11 million as compared to the same period in 2015 the increase was partially offset by a decrease in product field demonstration costs of 17 million primarily related to significant costs incurred in the previous year due to several next generation product transitions 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses decreased 05 million or 06 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in litigation expenses of 56 million during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 this decrease was primarily related to the timing of litigation activities associated with the cisco and optumsoft legal matters outlined in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements this decrease was largely offset by an increase in personnel costs of 49 million in the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 this reflects increased compensation costs including increased stockbased compensation and corporate bonus expense primarily driven by headcount growth 

other income expense net in thousands except percentages 



other income expense net improved during the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a net increase in interest income as we expanded our marketable securities portfolio 

provision for income taxes in thousands except percentages 



provision for income taxes was approximately 580 million and 249 million for the year ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the change in our provision was primarily due to an increase in profit before income taxes the increase in the provision was also a result of additional state and foreign taxes nondeductible permanent differences offset by a shift in the geographic foreign earnings mix taxed at a lower rate than the us tax rate 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations as of december 31 2017  our total balance of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was 15 billion  of which approximately 1180 million  was held outside the us in our foreign subsidiaries the tax act included a onetime transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings and accordingly we recorded tax expense of 188 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the transition tax on the onetime mandatory deemed repatriation of all our foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k for additional information on income taxes 

our cash cash equivalents and securities are held for working capital purposes our marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highlyrated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss we plan to continue to invest for longterm growth we believe that our existing balances of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for at least the next 12 months our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings our costs associated with supply chain activities including access to outsourced manufacturing our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies the continued market acceptance of our products and costs incurred related to outstanding litigation claims if we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

cash flows 



cash flows from operating activities 

our primary source of cash provided by operating activities has been cash collections from our customers we expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increased sales and timing of collections our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs inventory purchases from our contract manufacturers investment in research and development and litigation expenses 

during the year ended december 31 2017  cash provided by operating activities was 6316 million  primarily from net income of 4232 million  with noncash adjustments to net income of 1059 million  and a net increase of 1025 million  in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities our operating cash benefited 1423 million  from increased deferred revenue reflecting ongoing growth in service and support contracts 435 million  from increased accrued liabilities driven by increased inventory purchases and product development activities and 199 million  from increased income taxes payable these favorable changes were partially offset by a growth in inventory of 697 million  supporting overall growth in the business and the expansion of our manufacturing and supply chain activities by a decline in accounts payable of 301 million due to timing of vendor payments primarily related to inventory purchases and by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 116 million  primarily due to increased prepaid taxes 

during the year ended december 31 2016 cash provided by operating activities was 1743 million  primarily from net income of 1842 million with noncash adjustments to net income of 586 million  partially offset by a net decrease in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 684 million the decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements with accounts receivable up 1089 million inventories and inventory deposits up 2075 million and increased prepaid expenses and current assets excluding inventory deposits of 548 million which was primarily driven by an increase in deferred cost of inventory associated with increased product revenue deferrals referenced below these increases reflect substantial growth in the business and the expansion of our manufacturing and supply chain activities at our new contract manufacturer these working capital increases were partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of 1761 million reflecting ongoing growth in service and support contracts and a significant increase in product deferred revenue related to contract acceptance terms as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 693 million primarily due to timing of inventory purchases and an increase in income taxes payable of 427 million

cash flows from investing activities 

our investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases of available for sale marketable securities net of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities and capital expenditures we expect to continue investing in these activities to support the continued growth of our business 

during the year ended december 31 2017  cash used in investing activities was 3926 million  consisting of purchases of marketable securities of 5854 million  purchases of property equipment and other assets of 153 million  partially offset by proceeds of 2063 million  from maturities of marketable securities and proceeds of 30 million  from repayment of notes receivable

during the year ended december 31 2017  cash provided by financing activities was 515 million  consisting primarily of proceeds of 446 million  from employee stock option exercises partially offset by 40 million  of minimum tax withheld for employees and proceeds of 125 million  from employee stock purchases under our espp partially offset by payments of 16 million  for lease financing obligations 

during the year ended december 31 2016 cash provided by financing activities was 327 million  consisting primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 249 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our espp of 103 million partially offset by payments of 13 million  for lease financing obligations 

during the year ended december 31 2015 cash provided by financing activities was 259 million  consisting primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 178 million and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our espp of 94 million partially offset by payments of 11 million  for lease financing obligations 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2017  we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

contractual obligations and commitments 

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity our contractual obligations represent material expected or contractually committed future payment obligations we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing balances of cash cash equivalent and marketable securities 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2017  in thousands 



 

1 includes interest and land lease 

the contractual obligation table above excludes tax liabilities of 379 million  related to uncertain tax positions and the transition tax due under the tax act because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement if any of these future payments 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods we base our estimates assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements which in turn could change the results from those reported we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis actual results may differ from these estimates the critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are the following 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from sales of our products which incorporate our eos software and accessories such as cables and optics to direct customers and channel partners together with post contract customer support “pcs” we typically sell products and pcs in a single transaction we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery or performance has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

we define each of the four criteria above as follows 



return or pricing credits associated with our product sales in instances where substantive acceptance provisions are specified in the customer arrangement revenue and deferred cost of revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

 pcs which includes technical support hardware repair and replacement parts beyond standard warranty bug fixes patches and unspecified upgrades on a whenandifavailable basis is offered under renewable feebased contracts we initially defer pcs revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the pcs contract with the related expenses recognized as incurred pcs contracts usually have a term of one  to three  years we include billed but unearned pcs revenue in deferred revenue 

we report revenue net of sales taxes we include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold 

multipleelement arrangements 

most of our arrangements other than renewals of pcs are multiple element arrangements with a combination of products and pcs products and pcs generally qualify as separate units of accounting our hardware deliverables include eos software which together deliver the essential functionality of our products for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price the relative selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if available thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe is not available and best estimate of selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available as we have not been able to establish vsoe or tpe for our products and most of our services we generally utilize besp for the purposes of allocating revenue to each unit of accounting 

 we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services future performance obligations or subject to customerspecific return acceptance or refund privileges 

we account for multiple agreements with a single partner as one arrangement if the contractual terms andor substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are in effect parts of a single arrangement 

we may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is no contractual provision for such returns we estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied against currentperiod gross revenues specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” which replaces primarily all existing revenue recognition guidance under gaap and establishes common principles for recognizing revenue for all industries based on our assessment we will adopt the new standard in our first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method we do not expect the impact from adopting the new revenue guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition in the year of adoption see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item 8 of this form 10k for details 

inventory valuation and contract manufacturersupplier liabilities 

inventories primarily consist of finished goods and strategic components primarily integrated circuits inventories are stated at the lower of cost computed using the firstin firstout method and net realizable value manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory we record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value 

our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts we record a liability and a corresponding charge for noncancellable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers or suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes   

we use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures these estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers product development plans and current sales levels if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities 

income taxes 

income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that we recognize for financial reporting and income tax purposes 

we account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements but have not been reflected in our taxable income estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize 

we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

we regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether and to the extent to which additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense 

loss contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are a party to claims and legal proceedings including matters relating to commercial employee relations business practices and intellectual property in assessing loss contingencies we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss we record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we will record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

recent accounting pronouncements 

refer to “recent accounting pronouncements” in note 1 to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and investments in privately held companies 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars and therefore our revenue is not directly subject to foreign currency risk however we are indirectly exposed to foreign currency risk a stronger us dollar could make our products and services more expensive in foreign 

countries and therefore reduce demand a weaker us dollar could have the opposite effect such economic exposure to currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are also influenced by many other factors 

our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located which is primarily in the us and to a lesser extent in europe and asia our results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2017 and 2016 the effect of a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our operating results to date foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

interest rate sensitivity 

as of december 31 2017 and 2016 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling 15 billion  and 8678 million  respectively cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in money market funds corporate bonds us agency mortgagebacked securities us treasury securities and commercial papers our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the us a decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income for the year ended december 31 2017 and 2016 the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in overall interest rates would not have had a material impact on our interest income 

on the other hand when interest rates rise our marketable securities purchased at a lower yield would incur a marktomarket unrealized loss under certain circumstances if we are forced to sell our marketable securities prior to maturity we may incur realized losses in such investments however because of the conservative and shortterm nature of the investments in our portfolio a change in interest rates is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

investments in privately held companies 

our nonmarketable equity investments in privately held companies are recorded in investments noncurrent in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using the cost method as of december 31 2017 and 2016 the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was 361 million  

some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

management with the participation of our chief executive officer ceo and our chief financial officer cfo evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2017  the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures 

include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2017  our ceo and cfo concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting   

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by rule 13a15d and 15d15d of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended that occurred during the year ended december 31 2017  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of internal controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017  based on the framework set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control  integrated framework 2013 framework based on that assessment management concluded that as of december 31 2017  our internal control over financial reporting was effective 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017  has been audited by ernst  young llp the independent registered public accounting firm that audits our consolidated financial statements as stated in their report included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2017

 item 1 business 

we are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration data centers for enterprise support our cloud networking solutions consist of our extensible operating system or eos a set of network applications and our ethernet switching and routing platforms our cloud networking solutions deliver industryleading performance scalability availability programmability automation and visibility at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was purposebuilt to be fully programmable and highly modular the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services since we began shipping our products we have grown rapidly and according to crehan research we have achieved the second largest market share in data center 10254050100 gigabit ethernet switch ports excluding blade switching sold in 2016 

eos supports leading cloud and virtualization solutions including vmware nsx microsoft system center openstack and other cloud management frameworks we have worked with industry leaders to define new open protocols for the virtualized data center we coauthored the vxlan protocol specification with vmware and were the first to demonstrate vxlan integration and have now expanded vxlan routing and integration 

we use standard linux as our underlying operating system providing customers with access to all linux operating system facilities this allows customers to extend our eos software with offtheshelf linux applications and a growing number of open source management tools 

eos has a highly modular architecture which allows us to prevent network outages in deployments of our cloud networking solutions this architecture also allows us to rapidly develop new features and protocols without compromising the quality of the existing code base because all of our platform products are powered by the same binary image of eos we are able to deliver these new innovations to our entire installed base with minimal disruption 

eos a software platform for network programmability and automation provides an advanced level of programmability allowing customers to take advantage of prebuilt and custom eos applications as well as integration with a wide range of technology partner solutions 

in 2015 we introduced cloudvision a networkwide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation delivering a turnkey solution for cloud networking we believe cloudvision’s abstraction of the physical network to this broader networkwide perspective allows for a more efficient approach for several operational usecases related to automation visibility management security and 3 rd  party controller integration 

we sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners since shipping our first products in 2008 our cumulative endcustomer base has grown rapidly between december 31 2011 and december 31 2016  our cumulative endcustomer base grew from approximately 1100  to over 4200  our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others our customers include six of the largest cloud services providers based on annual revenue 

we have experienced rapid revenue growth over the last several years increasing our revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 519  from 1398 million  in 2011 to 11 billion  in 2016  for 2014 2015 and 2016 our revenue was 5841 million  8376 million  and 11 billion  respectively with our 2016  revenue growing 348  when compared to 2015  our net income has grown from 340 million  in 2011 to 869 million  1211 million  and 1842 million  in 2014  2015  and 2016  respectively 

industry background 

cloud computing is fundamentally changing the way it infrastructure is built and how applications are delivered in cloud computing applications are distributed across thousands of servers these servers are connected with highspeed network switches that together form a pool of resources that allows applications to be rapidly deployed and costeffectively updated cloud computing enables ubiquitous and ondemand network access to these applications from internetconnected devices including personal computers tablets and smartphones 

nearly all consumer applications today are delivered as cloud services enterprise applications are rapidly moving to the cloud as well since cloud services are easier and more cost effective to deploy scale and operate than traditional applications internet leaders like amazon ebay facebook google microsoft and yahoo pioneered the development of largescale cloud data centers in order to meet the growing demands of their users including business customers enterprises and service providers around the world are adopting cloud computing technologies in order to achieve similar performance improvements and cost reductions 

the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can be orders of magnitude higher than typical legacy data center networks therefore the networks in such cloud environments must be architected and built in a new way we refer to these nextgeneration data center networks as cloud networks cloud networks must deliver high capacity high availability and predictable performance and must be programmable to allow integration with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services 

limitations of traditional data center networks 

in our view cloud networks and legacy networks are fundamentally different in a traditional data center specific applications are installed on a small number of servers and most network traffic is servertoclient or “northsouth” traffic which results in perhaps a few terabitssecond of aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud most network traffic is servertoserver or “eastwest” traffic the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can exceed 1 petabitsecond orders of magnitude higher than that of typical legacy data center networks 

the much larger scale of cloud networks requires much higher network availability since network outages in the cloud are very expensive in terms of customer impact traditional network switches have evolved and the features and capabilities of their operating system have expanded over many years without addressing the structural deficiencies of their underlying software architectures making it difficult to achieve high network switch reliability 

some networking vendors have built products that use proprietary protocols to address the scaling needs of nextgeneration data centers however proprietary protocols are generally not acceptable to internet companies or cloud service providers because they create vendor lockin 

legacy networks are not programmable and as a result are extremely difficult to integrate with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services this lack of integration forces customers to continue to rely on time consuming errorprone manual processes that may be costprohibitive 

requirements for cloud networking 

cloud networks differ in many aspects from legacy networks including capacity performance scale availability programmability automation visibility security and cost performance the requirements for cloud networking include the following 



 our cloud networking solutions 

we are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration enterprise data centers our cloud networking platform was purposebuilt to address the functional and performance requirements for cloud networks we deliver our solutions via our industryleading 10254050100 gigabit ethernet switches and routers optimized for nextgeneration data center networks 

our cloud networking solutions consist of eos our extensible operating system a set of networking applications and our gigabit ethernet platforms at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was architected to be fully programmable and highly modular 

the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications and application programming interfaces or apis that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has further allowed us to integrate rapidly with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services 

the key benefits of our cloud networking solutions are as follows 

capacity performance and scalability 

our cloud networking platform enables data center networks to scale to hundreds of thousands of physical servers and millions of virtual machines with the least number of switching tiers we achieve this by leveraging standard protocols to meet the scale requirements of cloud computing we have used activeactive layer 2 and layer 3 network topologies to enable customers to build extremely large and resilient networks 

high availability 

our highly modular eos software architecture was designed to be faultisolating and selfhealing in order to deliver higher stability compared to legacy network operating systems in addition our customers can nondisruptively upgrade our switches running in the network using our smart system upgrade or ssu application 

open and programmable 

our eos software was purposebuilt to offer programmable interfaces throughout all levels of our software this has allowed us to integrate our cloud networking platform with a wide range of leading thirdparty applications for example we support vmware nsx openstack and microsoft system center for orchestration and fast provisioning enabling true workload mobility and automatic provisioning of physical switches we enable customers through application programming interfaces to write their own scripts to customize and optimize their networks in addition we support a wide range of softwaredefined network controllers via our openflow and directflow interfaces 

workflow automation 

our eos software enables enterprises to provision networking resources in minutes with no manual intervention through our zero touch provisioning we also natively support ansible cfengine chef puppet virtual network orchestration applications and thirdparty management tools cloudvision a networkwide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation delivers a turnkey solution for cloud networking cloudvision extends the same eos architectural approach across the network for state topology monitoring and visibility this enables enterprises to move to cloudclass automation without needing significant internal development finally eos embraces the devops model which is a software development method that combines development and operations to provision and monitor servers storage and network resources in a unified fashion 

network visibility 

our eos software provides a set of tools and applications that proactively monitor detect and notify network managers when network issues arise delivering realtime data to thirdparty management applications including corvil extrahop riverbed and splunk to provide detailed application visibility our telemetry applications include vm tracer which provides visibility down to the virtual machine level path tracer which detects errors in provisioned network paths mapreduce tracer which monitors and optimizes the performance of hadoop workloads and health tracer which monitors infrastructure resiliency our network visibility applications provide realtime insight into the status of the network they include lanz which monitors latency and danz 2017 a set of features previously only available in addon network visibility devices which provides advanced traffic monitoring with flow analysis and timestamps plus the ability to perform tap aggregation for reporting and analysis 

security 

macrosegmentation services mss™ is one of the services enabled via arista cloudvision since cloudvision maintains a networkwide database of all state within the network as well as direct integration with hypervisor resources like vmware vsphere and nsx it is aware of every workload that is within the network and it learns in real time about new devices or workloads that are added or removed from the network or moved across ports or servers macrosegmentation extends the concept of finegrained interhypervisor security to cloud networks by enabling dynamic security and services for physical to virtual workloads macrosegmentation security is a complement to finegrained security delivered via microsegmentation that is already implemented in the virtual switch of the physical host on which a vm is running 

lower total cost of ownership 

our cloud networking platform offers architectural and system advantages that provide our customers with costeffective and highly available cloud networking solutions our programmable scalable leafspine architectures combined with industryleading applications significantly reduce networking costs when compared to legacy network designs enabling faster time to service and improved availability our automation tools reduce the operational costs of provisioning managing and monitoring a data center network and speed up service delivery our visibility tools provide high levels of visibility into complex network environments without the need for additional data collection equipment as a result fewer network engineers are needed to operate large networks 

our market opportunity 

we compete primarily in the data center switching market for 10 gigabit ethernet and above excluding blade switches 

we believe that cloud computing represents a fundamental shift from traditional legacy data centers and that cloud networking is the fastest growing segment within the data center switching market as organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud architectures spending on cloud and nextgeneration data centers has increased rapidly over the last several years while traditional legacy it spending has been growing more slowly in 2017 our 7150 7050 7250 7300 and 7500 series platforms are now listed on the u s department of defense approved products lists integrated tracking system by the defense information systems agency 

our customers 

as of december 31 2016  we had delivered our cloud networking solutions to over 4200  end customers worldwide in over 80 countries our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others for each of the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  microsoft purchases through our channel partner world wide technology inc accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue 

our competitive strengths 

we believe the following strengths will allow us to maintain and extend our technology leadership position in cloud networking and nextgeneration data center ethernet products 



our founder and chief development officer was previously a founder and chief system architect at sun microsystems kenneth duda our founder and chief technology officer led the software development effort of eos 

 our products and technology

we use multiple silicon architectures across our products which allows us to build a broader range of products optimized for different functions in the network than competitors that utilize fewer silicon architectures while we use multiple silicon architectures all of our platforms are powered with the same binary eos image which significantly simplifies deployment and ensures the same rich feature set and consistent operation across all our products 

our extensible operating system 

the core of our cloud networking platform is our extensible operating system or eos which runs on top of standard linux and offers programmability at all layers of the stack all of our 10254050100 gigabit ethernet platforms run our eos software 

eos is based on a new and innovative architecture that is highly modular and consists of more than 100 separate processes that we call agents each one handling specific protocol processing device driver or system management functions each agent runs in user space as a separate linux process and is completely protected and isolated from all other agents 

we are constantly investing in our core infrastructure to provide the capabilities required for building modern cloud networks most recently by extending sysdb into netdb™ and enhancing scalability new requirements use in cloud and service provider networks and hybrid cloud deployments in enterprises require ongoing upgrades and extensions to our state oriented architecture 

eos attributes 

the modular and programmable architecture of eos enables us to offer a set of attributes capabilities and features that are essential for cloud networking and nextgeneration data centers 

high availability 

eos is selfhealing in the sense that individual processes can be restarted without impacting application traffic this architectural design principle supports selfhealing resiliency in our software easier software maintenance and module independence higher software quality overall and faster timetomarket for new features that customers require 

programmable at all layers 

eos is programmable at all layers from the linux kernel to switch configuration provisioning automation and detailed monitoring of the network public cloud providers have leveraged tools such as the eos software development kit sdk and eapi to implement fully customized infrastructure automation solutions 

workflow visibility 

through eos we have developed a wide range of applications available to our customers for purchase as additional licenses that enable enhanced network monitoring and visibility without requiring additional external monitoring devices this includes i dataanalyzer danz which provides access to raw network data for analysis by security troubleshooting and performance management tools ii latencyloss analyzer lanz which provides access to internal network performance loads and packet loss and latency occurring at the microsecond level iii network telemetry which provides network state information including correlations with dynamic state of the systems operating on the network such as hypervisors distributed job controls and iv network tracers which provide active integration and diagnostics for various workload conditions dependent upon network performance

eos supports puppet chef and ansible which enables automatic network configuration in the same manner as servers and storage in addition eos provides tools that greatly reduce network operational costs another major component of network automation is cloud vision 

cloudvision 

cloudvision’s abstraction of the physical network to a broader networkwide perspective allows for a more efficient approach for several operational usecases including the following highlights 

 leafspine network designs 

our customers typically deploy leafspine network topologies consisting of leaf switches or topofrack switches located in the server rack connected with uplinks to multiple loadsharing spine switches and routers that provide the backbone our leafspine network designs scale up to more than 300000 physical servers and millions of virtual machines using equal cost multiple path or ecmp to load balance layer 3 network traffic across multiple spine switches and routers with multichassis link aggregation or mlag we can build an activeactive layer 2 network that can connect more than 25000 physical servers our leafspine network designs have been widely deployed and provide predictable network bandwidth and latency a key advantage of predictable network performance is that it eliminates the need to optimize the network for specific applications which means a single network design works equally well for all applications 

enterprise resources commonly span multiple datacenters or performance optimized datacenters or pods within a data center including the public cloud the drive to deliver resources quickly affordably and reliably also drives the need for a flexible costeffective scaleout design at the datacenter core which we refer to as the “spine of spines” or universal spine the universal spine is nonblocking supports large scale ecmp ip routing and routing convergence the universal spine enables architects to build the network around the spine and collapse legacy networking layers into the universal spine 

  

examples of our leafspine and universal leafspine architectures are illustrated below 

customer support and services 

we have designed our customer support offerings to provide our customers with high levels of support our global team of support engineers engages directly with client it teams and is available at all times over email by phone or through our website 

we offer multiple service options that allow our customers to select the product replacement service level that best meets their needs we stock spare parts in over 125 locations around the world through our thirdparty logistics suppliers all of our service options include unlimited access to bugfixes new featurereleases online case management and our community forums 

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our products through our direct sales force and in partnership with our channel partners including distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators and oem partners we also sell in conjunction with various technology partners to facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity we have created a partner program the arista partner program to engage partners who provide valueadded services and extend our reach into the marketplace authorized training partners perform technical training of our channel partners and end customers our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us 

our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for presales technical support and solutions engineering for our end customers systems integrators original equipment manufacturers or oems and channel partners a pool of shared channel sales and marketing representatives also supports these teams each sales team is responsible for a geographical territory has responsibility for a number of major direct endcustomer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market we have field sales teams operating in over 80  countries 

our marketing activities consist primarily of technology conferences web marketing trade shows product demonstrations seminars and events public relations analyst relations demand generation and direct marketing to build our brand increase endcustomer awareness communicate our product advantages and generate qualified leads for our field sales force and channel partners 

research and development 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and features that address the needs of our end customers our inhouse engineering personnel are responsible for the development quality documentation support and release of our products we plan to continue to invest significantly in resources to conduct our research and development efforts our research and development expense was 2736 million 2094 million and 1489 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

manufacturing 

we subcontract the manufacturing of all of our products to various contract manufacturers our primary manufacturing partners are jabil circuit sanmina corporation and foxconn this approach allows us to reduce our costs manufacturing overhead and inventory position and allows us to adjust more quickly to changing endcustomer demand we require all of our manufacturing locations to be iso9001 certified our eos software is installed on our products at one of three direct fulfillment facilities 

our contract manufacturing partners procure the majority of the components needed to build our products and assemble our products according to our design specifications this allows us to leverage the purchasing power of our contract manufacturing partners 

we retain complete control over the bill of material test procedures and quality assurance programs our onsite personnel work closely with our partners and review on an ongoing basis forecasts inventory levels processes capacity yields and overall quality our contract manufacturing partners procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts these forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analyses from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions we update these forecasts monthly 

our products rely on key components including merchant silicon integrated circuit components and power supplies purchased from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers generally neither our contract manufacturers nor we have a written agreement with any of these component providers to guarantee the supply of the key components used in our products nor do we have exclusive rights to such key components our product development efforts also depend upon continued collaboration with our key suppliers including our merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors it is critical that we work in tandem with our key merchant silicon vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features this enables us to focus our research and development resources on software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions 

once the completed products are manufactured and tested our contract manufacturing partners ship them to various theatre direct fulfillment facilities in the united states the netherlands and singapore for final configuration quality control inspection and shipment to our distribution partners and end customers after the products are shipped to our end customers our products are installed by the end customers or by thirdparty service providers such as system integrators or value added resellers on their behalf 

backlog 

we do not have any longterm purchase commitments from customers customers generally order products on an asneeded basis with short lead and delivery times on a perpurchaseorder basis we maintain substantial finished goods inventory to ensure that products can generally be shipped shortly after receipt of an order a significant portion of our customer shipments in any fiscal year relate to orders received and shipped in that fiscal year our customers utilize purchase orders containing nonbinding purchase commitments and we allow customers to cancel change or reschedule orders without penalty at any time prior to shipment and as a result we do not believe backlog is firm due to the foregoing factors backlog is not a meaningful indicator in any given period of our ability to achieve any particular level of overall revenue or financial performance 

competition 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology changing endcustomer needs evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services we expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for cloud networking expands and existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products 

the data center networking market has been historically dominated by cisco systems with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including brocade communications systems which has entered into an agreement to be acquired by broadcom dellemc hewlett packard enterprises and juniper networks most of our competitors have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example in the last few years alone dell acquired force10 and emc ibm acquired blade network technology hewlett packard enterprises purchased aruba juniper acquired contrail cisco acquired insieme and broadcom intends to acquire brocade we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants including “whitebox” switch vendors as well as current technology partners and end customers who may develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products 

the principal competitive factors applicable to our products include 



we believe our products compete favorably with respect to these factors our eos software offers high reliability integrates with existing network protocols and is open and programmable we believe the combination of eos a set of network applications and our 10254050100 gigabit ethernet platforms make our offering highly competitive for both cloud and enterprise data centers however many of our competitors have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger sales and marketing budgets and resources broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and end customers greater access to larger endcustomer bases greater endcustomer support resources greater manufacturing resources the ability to leverage their sales efforts across a broader portfolio of products the ability to leverage purchasing power when purchasing subcomponents the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services the ability to develop their own silicon chips the ability to set more aggressive pricing policies lower labor and development costs greater resources to make acquisitions larger intellectual property portfolios and substantially greater financial technical research and development or other resources 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our core technology and intellectual property we rely on patent trademark and copyright laws trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees end customers resellers systems integrators and others to protect our intellectual property rights we file us and foreign patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 

we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of valuable breadth or applicability in addition any patents that may be issued may be contested circumvented found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them we also license software from third parties for integration into our products including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms we also own a number of trademarks in the us and other jurisdictions including arista eos cloudvision cloudstream cvp cvx health tracer mapreduce tracer path tracer mxp mss rail score spline superspine ssu flexroute netrollback netdb osfp algomatch macrosegmentation macrosegmentation service 

we control access to and use of our software technology and other proprietary information through internal and external controls including contractual protections with employees contractors end customers and partners our software is protected by us and international copyright patent and trade secret laws despite our efforts to protect our software technology and other proprietary information unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software technology and other proprietary information in addition we intend to expand our international operations and effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights if we become more successful we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights it may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights in particular large and established companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation from time to time third parties including certain of these large companies and nonpracticing entities may assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our end customers whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against such claims for example in december 2014 cisco systems filed two lawsuits against us in the northern district of california for alleged patent and copyright infringement additionally cisco systems filed two complaints against us in the international trade commission itc for patent infringement and the itc has initiated an investigation please see legal proceedings included in part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of this litigation successful claims of infringement by a third party if any could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services require us to expend time and money to develop noninfringing solutions or force us to pay substantial damages royalties or other fees we cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe or that we will not in the future infringe upon any thirdparty patents or other proprietary rights

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k which could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the risks described below are not the only risks facing us risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

risks related to our business and our industry 

our business and operations have experienced rapid growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected 

we have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last several years which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure our employee headcount and number of end customers have increased and we expect both to continue to grow over the next year for example between december 31 2011 and december 31 2016  our headcount grew from approximately 250 employees to approximately 1500 employees and our cumulative number of end customers grew from approximately 1100 to over 4200  as we have grown we have had to manage an increasingly large and more complex array of internal systems and processes to scale with all aspects of our business including our hardware and software development contract manufacturing and purchasing logistics and fulfillment and maintenance and support our success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and continue to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems we may not be able to successfully implement these or other improvements to our systems and processes in an efficient or timely manner and we may discover deficiencies in their capabilities or effectiveness we may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems and processes or in connection with thirdparty technology in addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate effectively and in the intended manner may result in disruption of our current operations and endcustomer relationships our inability to manage the growth of our business and our inability to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings and prevent certain losses 

our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and may increase the risk associated with your investment 

we shipped our first products in 2008 and the majority of our revenue growth has occurred since the beginning of 2010 our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects including our ability to plan for and model future growth we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries including the risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k if we do not address these risks successfully our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline further we have limited historical financial data and we operate in a rapidly evolving market as such any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market 

our results of operations are likely to vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors or our previously issued financial guidance or if any forwardlooking financial guidance does not meet the expectation of analysts or investors the market price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our results of operations have historically varied from period to period and we expect that this trend will continue as a result you should not rely upon our past financial results for any period as indicators of future performance our results of operations in any given period can be influenced by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict including 



 any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of several of the factors described above may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other results of operations this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our revenue gross margins results of operations or other expectations contained in any forward looking financial guidance we have issued or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for a particular period if we fail to meet or exceed such guidance or expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our common stock could decline substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits 

we expect large purchases by a limited number of end customers to continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue and any loss or delay of expected purchases could result in material quartertoquarter fluctuations of our revenue or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue many of these end customers make large purchases to complete or upgrade specific data center installations and are typically made on a purchaseorder basis rather than pursuant to longterm contracts revenue from sales to microsoft through our channel partner world wide technology inc accounted for 16 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  12 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  and 15 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  

as a consequence of the concentrated nature of our customer base and their purchasing behavior our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate for example any cancellation of orders or any acceleration or delay in anticipated product purchases or the acceptance of shipped products by our larger end customers could materially affect our revenue and results of operations in any quarterly period we may be unable to sustain or increase our revenue from our large end customers or offset the discontinuation of concentrated purchases by our larger end customers with purchases by new or existing end customers we expect that such concentrated purchases will continue to contribute materially to our revenue for the foreseeable future and that our results of operations may fluctuate materially as a result of such larger end customers’ buying patterns in addition we may see consolidation of our customer base such as among internet companies and cloud service providers which could result in loss of end customers the loss of such end customers or a significant delay or reduction in their purchases could materially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we face intense competition especially from larger wellestablished companies and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

the market for data center networking including the market for cloud networking is intensely competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants this competition could result in increased pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and our failure to increase or the loss of market share any of which would likely seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the data center networking market has been historically dominated by cisco systems with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including brocade communications systems which has entered into an agreement to be acquired by broadcom dellemc hewlett packard enterprise and juniper networks most of our competitors have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example in the last few years alone dell acquired force10 and emc ibm acquired blade network technology hewlett packard enterprises purchased aruba juniper acquired contrail cisco acquired insieme and broadcom who intends to acquire brocade we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants including white box switch vendors as well as current technology partners and end customers who may develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

 our competitors also may be able to provide end customers with capabilities or benefits different from or greater than those we can provide in areas such as technical qualifications or geographic presence or may be able to provide end customers a broader range of products services and prices in addition large competitors may have more extensive relationships with and within existing and potential end customers that provide them with an advantage in competing for business with those end customers for example certain large competitors encourage end customers of their other products and services to adopt their data networking solutions through discounted bundled product packages our ability to compete will depend upon our ability to provide a better solution than our competitors at a more competitive price we may be required to make substantial additional investments in research development marketing and sales in order to respond to competition and we cannot assure you that these investments will achieve any returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

we also expect increased competition if our market continues to expand conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or other factors current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties that have greater resources available than we do our current or potential competitors might take advantage of the greater resources of the larger organization resulting from these acquisitions to compete more vigorously or broadly with us in addition continued industry consolidation might adversely affect end customers’ perceptions of the viability of smaller and even mediumsized networking companies and consequently end customers’ willingness to purchase from those companies further certain large end customers may develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products which could allow these end customers to become new competitors in the market 

we are currently involved in litigation with cisco systems inc 

we are currently involved in several litigation matters with cisco systems inc these matters are summarized below 

cisco systems inc v arista networks inc case no 414cv05343 “’43 case” 

on december 5 2014 cisco filed a complaint against us in the district court for the northern district of california alleging that we infringe us patent nos 6377577 6741592 7023853 7061875 7162537 7200145 7224668 7290164 7340597 7460492 8051211 and 8356296 respectively “the ’577 patent” “the ’592 patent” “the ’853 patent” “the 875 patent” “the ’537 patent” “the ’145 patent” “the ’668 patent” “the ’164 patent” “the ’597 patent” “the ’492 patent” “the ’211 patent” and “the ’296 patent” cisco seeks as relief for our alleged infringement in the ’43 case lost profits andor reasonable royalty damages in an unspecified amount including treble damages attorney’s fees and associated costs cisco also seeks injunctive relief in the ’43 case on february 10 2015 the court granted our unopposed motion to stay the ’43 case until the proceedings before the united states international trade commission “usitc” pertaining to the same patents as discussed below became final trial has not been scheduled in the ’43 case 

cisco systems inc v arista networks inc case no 514cv05344 “’44 case”   

on december 5 2014 cisco filed a complaint against us in the district court for the northern district of california alleging that we infringe numerous copyrights pertaining to cisco’s “command line interface” or “cli” and us patent nos 7047526 and 7953886 respectively “the ’526 patent” and “the ’886 patent” as relief for our alleged patent infringement in the ’44 case cisco seeks lost profits andor reasonable royalty damages in an unspecified amount including treble damages attorney’s fees and associated costs as well as injunctive relief as relief for our alleged copyright infringement cisco seeks monetary damages for alleged lost profits profits from our alleged infringement statutory damages attorneys fees and associated costs 

on february 13 2015 we answered the complaint in the ’44 case denying the patent and copyright infringement allegations and raising numerous affirmative defenses on march 6 2015 cisco filed an amended complaint against us in the ’44 case in response we moved to dismiss cisco’s allegations of willful patent infringement and presuit indirect patent infringement the court granted the motion with leave to amend on july 2 2015 on july 23 2015 cisco filed an amended complaint 

as described below on may 25 2016 our petition for inter partes review “ipr” of the ’886 patent was instituted by the united states patent trial and appeal board “ptab” cisco subsequently agreed to dismiss its claims as to the ‘886 patent with prejudice 

summary judgment crossmotions in the ’44 case were heard on august 4 2016 and the court denied all motions brought by both sides trial began on november 28 2016 and the jury rendered its verdict on december 14 2016 the jury found that we had proven our copyright defense of scenes a faire and that cisco had failed to prove infringement of the ’526 patent and on that basis judgment was entered in arista’s favor on all claims on december 19 2016 

on january 17 2017 cisco filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law challenging the sufficiency of the evidence in support of our scenes a faire defense cisco did not file any posttrial motion regarding the ’526 patent nor did it file a motion for a new trial we also filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law on several issues the hearing on both parties’ motions is currently set for april 27 2017 

arista networks inc v cisco systems inc case no 516cv00923 “’23 case” 

on february 24 2016 we filed a complaint against cisco in the district court for the northern district of california alleging antitrust violations and unfair competition on april 13 2016 cisco filed a motion to stay the ’23 case or in the alternative to dismiss the complaint on august 23 2016 the court granted cisco’s motion to stay the ’23 case until judgment has been entered on cisco’s copyright claims in the ’44 case which the court anticipated by december 22 2016 following the jury’s verdict in arista’s favor in the ’44 case the parties filed a stipulation continuing the case management conference until march 2 2017 trial in the ’23 case is set for august 3 2018 and is not affected by the court’s granting of the interim stay 

certain network devices related software and components thereof inv no 337ta944 “944 investigation” 

on december 19 2014 cisco filed a complaint against us in the usitc alleging that arista has violated section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 as amended the usitc instituted cisco’s complaint as investigation no 337ta944 cisco initially alleged that certain arista switching products infringe the ’592 ’537 ’145 ’164 ’597 and ’296 patents cisco subsequently dropped the ’296 patent from the 944 investigation cisco sought among other things a limited exclusion order barring entry into the united states of accused switch products including arista’s 7000 series of switches and components and software therein and a cease and desist order against us restricting our activities with respect to our imported accused switch products and components and software therein on february 11 2015 we responded to the complaint in the 944 investigation by among other things denying the patent infringement allegations and raising numerous affirmative defenses 

the administrative law judge “alj” assigned to the 944 investigation issued a procedural schedule calling for among other events an evidentiary hearing on september 911 and 1517 2015 issuance of an initial determination regarding our alleged violations on january 27 2016 and a target date for completion of the investigation on may 27 2016 on january 27 2016 the alj issued a

both we and cisco filed petitions for review of the usitc’s final determination to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit “federal circuit” on august 26 2016 the federal circuit consolidated the appeals and on september 23 2016 it issued an order setting an expedited briefing schedule the appeal is fully briefed and oral argument has not been scheduled 

on august 26 2016 cisco filed an enforcement complaint under section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 as amended with the usitc cisco alleges that we are violating the cease and desist and limited exclusion orders issued in the 944 investigation by engaging in the “marketing distribution offering for sale selling advertising andor aiding or abetting other entities in the sale andor distribution of products that cisco alleges continue to infringe claims 12 811 and 1719 of the ’537 patent” despite the design changes we have made to those products cisco asks the ustic to 1 enforce the cease and desist order 2 modify the commission’s limited exclusion order andor cease and desist order “in any manner that would assist in the prevention of the unfair practices that were originally the basis for issuing such order or assist in the detection of violations of such order” 3 impose the maximum statutory civil penalties for violation of the cease and desist order “including monetary sanctions for each day’s violation of the cease and desist order of the greater of 10000000 or twice the domestic value of the articles entered or sold whichever is higher” 4 bring a civil action in us district court “requesting collection of such civil penalties and the issuance of a mandatory injunction preventing further violation of cease and desist order” and 5 impose “such other remedies and sanctions as are appropriate and within the commission’s authority” on september 28 2016 the commission instituted the enforcement proceeding the proceeding has been assigned to administrative law judge shaw who presided over the underlying investigation on october 14 2016 we responded to the complaint by among other things denying the patent infringement allegations and raising affirmative defenses on november 2 2016 the alj issued an order setting the deadline for the initial determination for june 20 2017 and the target date for september 20 2017 on november 3 2016 the alj issued a scheduling order setting the evidentiary hearing in this proceeding for april 5 2017 

certain network devices related software and components thereof inv no 337ta945 “945 investigation” 

on december 19 2014 cisco filed a complaint against us in the usitc alleging that arista violated section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 as amended the usitc instituted cisco’s complaint as investigation no 337ta945 cisco alleges that certain arista switching products infringe the ’577 ’853 ’875 ’668 ’492 and ’211 patents cisco seeks among other things a limited exclusion order barring entry into the united states of accused switch products including arista’s 7000 series of switches related software and components thereof and a cease and desist order against us restricting our activities with respect to our imported accused switch products related software and components thereof on february 11 2015 we responded to the notice of investigation and complaint in the 945 investigation by among other things denying the patent infringement allegations and raising numerous affirmative defenses 

the alj issued a procedural schedule calling for among other events an evidentiary hearing on november 920 2015 issuance of an initial determination regarding our alleged violations on april 26 2016 and a target date for completion on august 26 2016 on march 29 2016 the alj issued a revised procedural schedule extending the deadline for issuance of an initial determination to august 26 2016 and extending the target date to december 26 2016 on august 24 2016 the alj issued a revised procedural schedule extending the deadline for issuance of an initial determination to november 7 2016 and extending the target date to march 7 2017 on november 4 2016 the alj issued a revised procedural schedule extending the deadline for issuance of an initial determination to december 7 2016 and extending the target date to april 7 2017 on december 7 2016 the alj issued a revised procedural schedule extending the deadline for issuance of an initial determination to december 9 2016 and extending the target date to april 9 2017 

on december 9 2016 the alj issued her initial determination finding a violation of section 337 of the tariff act more specifically the alj found that a violation has occurred in the importation into the united states the sale for importation or the sale within the united states after importation of certain network devices related software and components thereof that the alj found infringe asserted claims 1 7 9 10 and 15 of the ’577 patent and asserted claims 1 2 4 5 7 8 10 13 19 56 and 64 of the ’668 patent the alj did not find a violation of section 337 with respect to asserted claim 2 of the ’577 patent or any asserted claims of the ’853 ’492 ’875 and ’211 patents on december 29 2016 arista cisco and the office of unfair import investigation ouii filed petitions for review of certain findings contained in the initial determination on january 3 2017 the commission extended the target date to april 17 2017 and set the deadline for determining whether to review the final initial determination to february 15 2017 on january 

27 2017 the commission further extended the target date to may 1 2017 and set the deadline for determining whether to review the final initial determination to march 1 2017 if the commission finds a violation in its final determination that finding will be subject to a 60day presidential review period 

inter partes reviews 

we have filed petitions for inter partes review “ipr” of the ’597 ’211 ’668 ’853 ’537 ’577 ’886 and ’526 patents 

iprs relating to the ’597 ipr no 201500978 and ’211 ipr no 201500975 patents were instituted in october 2015 and hearings on these iprs were completed in july 2016 on september 28 2016 the ptab issued a final written decision finding claims 1 14 3942 71 72 84 and 85 of the ’597 patent unpatentable the ptab also found that claims 29 63 64 73 and 86 of the ’597 patent had not been shown to be unpatentable cisco requested rehearing of the ptab’s final written decision on october 28 2016 which the ptab denied on january 13 2017 on january 23 2017 we filed a notice of appeal with respect to this decision regarding claims 29 63 64 73 and 86 of the ’597 patent on october 5 2016 the ptab issued a final written decision finding claims 1 and 12 of the ’211 patent unpatentable the ptab also found that claims 2 69 13 1720 of the ’211 patent had not been shown to be unpatentable on december 5 2016 we filed a notice of appeal with respect to this decision regarding claims 2 69 13 1720 which was docketed as appeal no 171313 cisco filed a notice of crossappeal with respect to claims 1 and 12 on december 19 2016 which was docketed as appeal no 171380 the court of appeals for the federal circuit consolidated these appeals on december 20 2016 the briefing is set to be completed in july 2017 

the ipr relating to the ’886 patent was instituted on may 25 2016 following that decision cisco agreed to dismiss its claims as to the ʼ886 patent with prejudice and we dismissed our counterclaims as to the ʼ886 patent without prejudice 

iprs relating to the ’668 ipr no 201600309 ’577 ipr no 201600303 ’853 ipr no 20160306 and ’537 ipr no 20160308 patents were instituted in june 2016 and are set for hearing in march 2017 final written decisions on these iprs will be issued by june 2017 

     

we intend to vigorously defend against each of the cisco’s lawsuits as summarized in the preceding paragraphs however we cannot be certain that any claims by cisco would be resolved in our favor regardless of the merit of the claims any adverse litigation ruling could result in the above described injunctive relief could require a significant damages award against us or a requirement that we make substantial royalty payments to cisco andor could require that we modify our products to the extent that we are found to infringe any valid claims asserted against us by cisco 

for example in the 944 investigation the usitc has issued a limited exclusion order barring entry into the united states of our network devices including our 7000 series of switches related software and components thereof that infringe one or more of the claims of the ʼ537 ʼ592 and ʼ145 patents specified above and a cease and desist order restricting our activities with respect to such imported products in addition in the 945 investigation the alj has issued her initial determination finding a violation of section 337 of the tariff act with respect to the ‘668 and ‘577 patents which is now subject to review by the commission 

to comply with these orders we have sought to develop technical designarounds that no longer infringe the patents that are the subject of the orders in any efforts to develop technical designarounds for our products we may be unable to do so in a manner that does not continue to infringe the patents or that is acceptable to our customers these development efforts could be extremely costly and time consuming as well as disruptive to our other development activities and distracting to management moreover in the 944 investigation and 945 investigation such designarounds would require us to obtain approval of either the usitc or us customs and border protection “cbp” to resume the importation of the redesigned products into the united states we may not be successful in our efforts to obtain such approvals to import such modified products in a timely manner or at all while a favorable ruling from the cbp would allow us to resume importation of our redesigned products into the united states the usitc could still determine in an enforcement action that our redesigned products continue to infringe the patents that are the subject of any usitc orders any failure to effectively redesign our products to obtain timely clearance from usitc or cbp to import such redesigned products or to address the usitc findings in a manner that complies with the usitc orders may cause a disruption to our product shipments and materially and adversely affect our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition 

specifically in response to the usitc’s findings in the 944 investigation we have made design changes to our products for sale in the united states to address the features that were found to infringe the ʼ537 ’592 ’145 patents following the issuance of the final determination in the 944 investigation we submitted a section 177 ruling request to cbp seeking approval to import these redesigned products into the united states on november 18 2016 we received a 177 ruling from cbp finding that our redesigned products did not infringe the ‘537 ’592 and ‘145 patents and approving the importation of these redesigned products into the united states however on january 13 2017 at the request of cisco systems and without our input cbp issued a letter to us revoking its prior november 18 ruling due to this revocation arista can no longer import its products into the united states the cbp has informed us that it currently takes no position on whether arista’s redesigned products infringe and will conduct an inter partes proceeding between arista and cisco to determine whether arista’s redesigned products infringe and whether to approve them for importation into the united states we do 

not yet know when cbp will complete the process and provide that ruling the cbp may not rule in a timely fashion and we may not receive a favorable ruling at the end of the process 

similarly if the usitc finds in a final determination that we infringe any patent in the 945 investigation the usitc will likely issue remedial orders in that investigation as well if such orders are not disapproved by the united states trade representative we would need to further modify our products to take our products outside the scope of any patents we are found to have infringed in the 945 investigation and obtain the usitc andor cbp approvals described above in order to resume importation of our redesigned products into the united states 

 if the usitc determines that our redesigned products continue to infringe the patents subject to any usitc limited exclusion order or cease and desist order in an enforcement action for either the 944 investigation or the 945 investigation the usitc may impose the maximum statutory civil penalties for violation of the cease and desist order “including monetary sanctions for each day’s violation of the cease and desist order of the greater of 10000000 or twice the domestic value of the articles entered or sold whichever is higher” bring a civil action in us district court “requesting collection of such civil penalties and the issuance of a mandatory injunction preventing further violation of cease and desist order” or impose “such other remedies and sanctions as are appropriate and within the commission’s authority” 

in order to comply with the usitc’s remedial orders we have also made certain changes to our manufacturing importation and shipping workflows these changes have included shifting manufacturing and integration of our products to be sold in the united states to us facilities such changes may be extremely costly time consuming and we may not be able to implement such changes successfully any failure to successfully change our manufacturing and importation processes or shipping workflows in a manner that is compliant with the limited exclusion order and cease and desist order may cause a disruption in our product shipments and materially and adversely affect our business prospects reputation results of operations and financial condition 

in connection with these changes to the extent that we are required to make further modifications to our supply chain to obtain alternative us sources for subcomponents we may be unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner if at all which could delay or halt entirely production of our products or require us to make further modifications to our products to incorporate new components that are available in the united states any of these events could result in lost sales reduced gross margins or damage to our endcustomer relationships which would materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

additionally the existence of ciscoʼs lawsuits against us could cause concern among our customers and partners and could adversely affect our business and results of operations many of our customers and partners require us to indemnify and defend them against third party infringement claims and pay damages in the case of adverse rulings these claims could harm our relationships with our customers or channel partners cause them to delay or defer purchasing decisions or deter them from doing business with us from time to time we may also be required to provide additional assurances beyond our standard terms whether or not we prevail in the lawsuit we expect that the litigation will be expensive timeconsuming and a distraction to management in operating our business 

we are currently involved in a license dispute with optumsoft inc 

on april 4 2014 optumsoft filed a lawsuit against us in the superior court of california santa clara county titled optumsoft inc v arista networks inc  in which it asserts i ownership of certain components of our eos network operating system pursuant to the terms of a 2004 agreement between the companies and ii breaches of certain confidentiality and use restrictions in that agreement under the terms of the 2004 agreement optumsoft provided us with a nonexclusive irrevocable royaltyfree license to software delivered by optumsoft comprising a software tool used to develop certain components of eos and a runtime library that is incorporated into eos the 2004 agreement places certain restrictions on our use and disclosure of the optumsoft software and gives optumsoft ownership of improvements modifications and corrections to and derivative works of the optumsoft software that we develop 

in its lawsuit optumsoft has asked the court to order us to i give optumsoft access to our software for evaluation by optumsoft ii cease all conduct constituting the alleged confidentiality and use restriction breaches iii secure the return or deletion of optumsoft’s alleged intellectual property provided to third parties including our customers iv assign ownership to optumsoft of optumsoft’s alleged intellectual property currently owned by us and v pay optumsoft’s alleged damages attorney’s fees and costs of the lawsuit david cheriton one of our founders and a former member of our board of directors who resigned from our board of directors on march 1 2014 and has no continuing role with us is a founder and we believe the largest stockholder and director of optumsoft the 2010 david r cheriton irrevocable trust dtd july 28 2010 a trust for the benefit of the minor children of mr cheriton is one of our largest stockholders 

on april 14 2014 we filed a crosscomplaint against optumsoft in which we assert our ownership of the software components at issue and our interpretation of the 2004 agreement among other things we assert that the language of the 2004 agreement and the parties’ long course of conduct support our ownership of the disputed software components we ask the court to declare our ownership of those software components all similarlysituated software components developed in the future and all related intellectual property we also assert that even if we are found not to own certain components such components are licensed to us under the terms of the 2004 agreement however there can be no assurance that our assertions will ultimately prevail in litigation on the same day we also filed an answer to optumsoft’s claims as well as affirmative defenses based in part on optumsoft’s failure to maintain the confidentiality of 

its claimed trade secrets its authorization of the disclosures it asserts and its delay in claiming ownership of the software components at issue we have also taken additional steps to respond to optumsoft’s allegations that we improperly used andor disclosed optumsoft confidential information while we believe we have meritorious defenses to these allegations we believe we have i revised our software to remove the elements we understand to be the subject of the claims relating to improper use and disclosure of optumsoft confidential information and made the revised software available to our customers and ii removed information from our website that optumsoft asserted disclosed optumsoft confidential information 

the parties tried phase i of the case relating to contract interpretation and application of the contract to certain claimed source code in september 2015 on december 16 2015 the court issued a proposed statement of decision following phase 1 trial and on january 8 2016 optumsoft filed objections to that proposed statement of decision on march 23 2016 the court issued a final statement of decision following phase i trial in which it agreed with and adopted our interpretation of the 2004 agreement and held that we and not optumsoft own all the software at issue in phase i the remaining issues that were not addressed in the phase i trial are set to be tried in phase ii including the application of the court’s interpretation of the 2004 agreement as set forth in the final statement of decision following phase i trial to any other source code that optumsoft claims to own following a review phase ii was previously scheduled to be tried in april 2016 however that trial date has been vacated and a new trial date has not yet been set 

we intend to vigorously defend against any claims brought against us by optumsoft however we cannot be certain that if litigated any claims by optumsoft would be resolved in our favor for example if it were determined that optumsoft owned components of our eos network operating system we would be required to transfer ownership of those components and any related intellectual property to optumsoft if optumsoft were the owner of those components it could make them available to our competitors such as through a sale or license an adverse litigation ruling could result in a significant damages award against us and injunctive relief in addition optumsoft could assert additional or different claims against us including claims that our license from optumsoft is invalid 

our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance 

our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance we experienced annual revenue growth rates of 348  434 and 617 in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we may not achieve similar revenue growth rates in future periods especially as we enter and expand into the cloud services and application services provider markets you should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual period as any indication of our future revenue or revenue growth if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

some of our large end customers require more favorable terms and conditions from their vendors and may request price concessions as we seek to sell more products to these end customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenue 

our large end customers have significant purchasing power and as a result may receive more favorable terms and conditions than we typically provide to other end customers including lower prices bundled upgrades extended warranties acceptance terms indemnification terms and extended return policies and other contractual rights as we seek to sell more products to these large end customers an increased mix of our shipments may be subject to such terms and conditions which may reduce our margins or affect the timing of our revenue recognition and thus may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

the cloud networking market can be characterized by rapid technological shifts and increasingly complex endcustomer requirements to achieve scalable and more programmable networks that facilitate virtualization big data publicprivate cloud and web scale computing we must continue to develop new technologies and products that address emerging technological trends and changing endcustomer needs the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and new offerings requires significant upfront investment that may not result in material design improvements to existing products or result in marketable new products or costs savings or revenue for an extended period of time if at all the success of new products depends on several factors including appropriate new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 

in addition new technologies could render our existing products obsolete or less attractive to end customers and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if such technologies are widely adopted for example end customers may prefer to address their network switch requirements by licensing software operating systems separately and placing them on industrystandard servers or develop their own networking products rather than purchasing integrated hardware products as has occurred in the server industry 

we may not be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology or endcustomer requirements on a timely basis or at all if we fail to keep up with technology changes or to convince our end customers and potential end customers of the value of our 

solutions even in light of new technologies our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

product quality problems defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate advanced technologies including both hardware and software technologies despite testing prior to their release our products may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in analyzing correcting or redesigning the products cause us to lose significant end customers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

from time to time we have had to replace certain components of products that we had shipped and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs including failures in software protocols or defective component batches resulting in reliability issues in such products and we may be required to do so in the future we may also be required to provide full replacements or refunds for such defective products we cannot assure you that such remediation would not have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects please see “our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects” 

managing the supply of our products and product components is complex insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing the supply of our products and product components is complex and our inventory management systems and related supplychain visibility tools may not enable us to forecast accurately and manage effectively the supply of our products and product components furthermore ongoing cisco litigation before the usitc and any adverse ruling that results from such litigation could cause disruption to our supplychain or with our suppliers which may impact our revenues business and reputation for example in the 944 investigation the usitc has issued a limited exclusion order barring entry into the united states of our network devices including our 7000 series of switches related software and components thereof that infringe one or more of the claims of the ʼ537 ʼ592 and ʼ145 patents specified above and a cease and desist order restricting our activities with respect to such imported products which could prevent us from using inventory to satisfy us demand and may cause us to writedown such inventory which could reduce our gross margins 

to the extent that we are required to obtain alternative us sources for these components we may be unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner if at all sales of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products any of these events could result in lost sales reduced gross margins or damage to our endcustomer relationships which would materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

insufficient supply and inventory may result in increased lead times for our products lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply from time to time we may issue purchase orders for components and products that are noncancelable and nonreturnable we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our component inventory suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or for products that are considered obsolete in addition we establish a liability and reimburse our contract manufacturer for component inventory purchased on our behalf that has been rendered excess or obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders or in cases where inventory levels greatly exceed our demand forecasts 

supply management remains an increased area of focus as we balance the need to maintain sufficient supply levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of obsolescence or the end of life of certain products if we ultimately determine that we have excess supply we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins we record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value 

alternatively insufficient supply levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential end customers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available additionally any increases in the time required to manufacture our products or ship products could result in supply shortfalls if we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

because some of the key components in our products come from sole limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers and may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

our products rely on key components including integrated circuit components and power supplies that our contract manufacturers purchase on our behalf from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers we do not have guaranteed supply contracts with any of our component suppliers and our suppliers could delay shipments or cease manufacturing such products or selling them to us at any time for example in the past we have experienced shortages in inventory for dynamic random access memory integrated circuits and delayed releases of the next generation of chipset which delayed our production andor the release of our new products the development of alternate sources for those components is timeconsuming difficult and costly additionally in the 944 investigation the usitc has issued a limited exclusion order barring entry into the united states of our network devices including our 7000 series of switches related software and components thereof that infringe one or more of the claims of the ʼ537 ʼ592 and ʼ145 patents specified above and a cease and desist order restricting our activities with respect to such imported products if we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner or if we are unable to obtain alternative sources for these components sales of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products any of these events could result in lost sales reduced gross margins or damage to our endcustomer relationships which would adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our reliance on component suppliers also yields the potential for their infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property rights with respect to components which may be incorporated into our products we may not be indemnified by such component suppliers for such infringement or misappropriation claims any litigation for which we do not receive indemnification could require us to incur significant legal expenses in defending against such claims or require us to pay substantial royalty payments or settlement amounts that would not be reimbursed by our component suppliers 

our product development efforts are also dependent upon our continued collaboration with our key merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors it is critical that we work in tandem with our key merchant silicon vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features this enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions 

if our key merchant silicon vendors do not continue to collaborate in such a fashion if they do not continue to innovate or if there are delays in the release of their products our own product launches could be delayed which could have a material effect on revenue and business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in the event of a shortage or supply interruption from our component suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner further longterm supply and maintenance obligations to end customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in addition our component suppliers change their selling prices frequently in response to market trends including industrywide increases in demand and because we do not have contracts with these suppliers we are susceptible to price fluctuations related to raw materials and components if we are unable to pass component price increases along to our end customers or maintain stable pricing our gross margins could be adversely affected and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

because we depend on thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping endcustomer orders on time if at all or on a costeffective basis which may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

we depend on thirdparty contract manufacturers to manufacture our product lines a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to these thirdparty contract manufacturers our reliance on these thirdparty contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process quality assurance product costs and product supply and timing which exposes us to risk to the extent that our products are manufactured at facilities in foreign countries we may be subject to additional risks associated with complying with local rules and regulations in those jurisdictions our reliance on contract manufacturers also yields the potential for their infringement of third party intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of our products or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of other customers’ products if we are unable to manage our relationships with our thirdparty contract manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers suffer delays or disruptions or quality control problems in their operations experience increased manufacturing lead times capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our end customers would be severely impaired and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be seriously harmed 

our contract manufacturers typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual orders we do not have longterm contracts with our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular pricing terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements which could result in supply shortages and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice for example a competitor could place large orders with the thirdparty manufacturer thereby utilizing all or substantially all of such thirdparty manufacturer’s capacity and leaving the manufacturer little or no capacity to fulfill our individual orders without price increases or delays or at all our contract with one of our 

contract manufacturers permits it to terminate the agreement for convenience subject to prior notice requirements we may not be able to develop alternate or second contract manufacturers in a timely manner 

if we add or change contract manufacturers or change any manufacturing plant locations within a contract manufacturer network we would add additional complexity and risk to our supply chain management and may increase our working capital requirements ensuring a new contract manufacturer or new plant location is qualified to manufacture our products to our standards and industry requirements could take significant effort and be time consuming and expensive for example we have added sanmina as an additional contract manufacturer any such addition or change in manufacturers may be extremely costly time consuming and we may not be able to do so successfully 

in addition we may be subject to additional significant challenges in ensuring that quality processes and costs among other issues are consistent with our expectations and those of our customers a new contract manufacturer or manufacturing location may not be able to scale its production of our products at the volumes or quality we require this could also adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers which could damage our customer relationships and cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end customers late delivery penalties delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins this could also result in increased levels of inventory subjecting us to increased excess and obsolete charges that could have a negative impact on our operating results 

we have expanded our contract manufacturing capabilities to include sanmina as an additional contract manufacturer which will increase our working capital requirements and the risks noted above apply to this new contract manufacturer no assurance can be given that this contract manufacturer will continue to successfully qualify and scale production of our products in the volumes or quality that we require if a usitc limited exclusion order issued in connection with the cisco litigation bars entry of our products into the united states and we are unable to obtain cpb approval to resume the importation of our redesigned products we would become reliant upon us manufacturing to continue to supply our products to our us customers any failure to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers could damage our customer relationships and cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end customers late delivery penalties delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins 

any production interruptions or disruptions for any reason including those noted above as well as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages adverse results from intellectual property litigation or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would adversely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are unable to attract new large end customers or to sell additional products to our existing end customers our revenue growth will be adversely affected and our revenue could decrease 

to increase our revenue we must add new end customers and large end customers and sell additional products to existing end customers for example one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our solutions thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers we believe this opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing infrastructure and expected future spend if we fail to attract new large end customers or fail to reduce the sales cycle and sell additional products to our existing end customers our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

we may be subject to supply chain delays or endcustomer buying patterns in which a substantial portion of sales orders and shipments may occur in the second half of each quarter this places significant pressure on order review and processing supply chain management manufacturing inventory and quality control management shipping and trade compliance to ensure that we have properly forecasted supply purchasing manufacturing capacity inventory and quality compliance and logistics if there is any significant interruption in these critical functions it could result in delayed order fulfillment adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

we base our inventory requirements on our forecasts of future sales if these forecasts are materially inaccurate we may procure inventory that we may be unable to use in a timely manner or at all 

we and our contract manufacturers procure components and build our products based on our forecasts these forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products which are in turn based on historical trends and analyses from our sales and marketing organizations adjusted for overall market conditions and other factors to the extent our forecasts are materially inaccurate or if we otherwise do not need such inventory we may under or overprocure inventory and such inaccuracies in our forecasts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the sales prices of our products and services may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our results of operations 

the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts a change in our mix of products and services the introduction of new products and services by us or by our competitors promotional programs product and related warranty costs or broader macroeconomic factors in addition we have provided and may 

in the future provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers 

we have experienced declines in sales prices for our products competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and services additionally although we generally price our products worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may adversely affect actual prices that partners and end customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles decreased sales prices for any reason may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our result of operations 

seasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations 

we operate on a december 31st year end and believe that there are significant seasonal factors which may cause sequential product revenue growth to be greater for the second and fourth quarters of our year than our first and third quarters we believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors including the procurement budgeting and deployment cycles of many of our end customers our rapid historical growth may have reduced the impact of seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date as our increasing size causes our growth rate to slow seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the cloud networking market is still in its early stages and is rapidly evolving if this market does not evolve as we anticipate or our target end customers do not adopt our cloud networking solutions we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

the cloud networking market is still in its early stages the market demand for cloud networking solutions has increased in recent years as end customers have deployed larger networks and have increased the use of virtualization and cloud computing our success depends upon our ability to provide cloud networking solutions that address the needs of end customers more effectively and economically than those of other competitors or existing technologies 

if the cloud networking solutions market does not develop in the way we anticipate if our solutions do not offer benefits compared to competing network switching products or if end customers do not recognize the benefits that our solutions provide then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

if we are unable to increase market awareness of our company and our products our revenue may not continue to grow or may decline 

we have not yet established broad market awareness of our products and services market awareness of our value proposition and products and services will be essential to our continued growth and our success particularly for the service provider and large enterprise markets if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful in creating market awareness of our company and our products and services then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act the listing requirements of the new york stock exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or the sarbanesoxley act and the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act compliance with these rules and regulations and the attendant responsibilities of management and the board may make it more difficult to attract and retain executive officers and members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee has increased our legal and financial compliance costs made some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and increased demand on our systems and resources among other things the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to maintain and if required improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard significant resources and management oversight may be required in addition if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 we could be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs pay fines settlements or judgments as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects although we have already hired additional employees to help comply with these requirements we may need to further expand our legal and finance departments in the future which will increase our costs and expenses 

in addition changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure such as continued rulemaking pursuant to the doddfrank act and related rules and regulations are creating uncertainty for public companies increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming these laws regulations and standards are subject 

to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if our efforts to comply with new laws regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business and prospects may be harmed as a result of disclosure of information in the filings required of a public company our business and financial condition will become more visible which may result in threatened or actual litigation including by competitors and other third parties if such claims are successful our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be harmed and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor these claims and the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert the resources of our management and harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in addition as a result of our disclosure obligations as a public company we will have reduced strategic flexibility and will be under pressure to focus on shortterm results which may adversely affect our ability to achieve longterm profitability we also believe that being a public company and these new rules and regulations makes it more expensive for us to obtain and maintain director and officer liability insurance and in the future we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee and qualified executive officers 

if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

assessing our processes procedures and staffing in order to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes many of which are done manually and are dependent upon individual data input or review these processes include but are not limited to calculating revenue inventory costs and the preparation of our statement of cash flows while we continue to automate our processes and enhance our review controls to reduce the likelihood for errors we expect that for the foreseeable future many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error 

in the past we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and we cannot give assurance that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future the existence of one or more material weaknesses could preclude a conclusion by management that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting the existence or disclosure of any such material weakness could adversely affect our stock price 

if we are unable to hire retain train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel particularly software engineering and sales personnel competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense especially in the san francisco bay area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have to provide more attractive compensation packages and other amenities research and development personnel are aggressively recruited by startup and growth companies which are especially active in many of the technical areas and geographic regions in which we conduct product development in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the hightechnology industry job candidates often consider the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to attract motivate or retain key employees if we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel or if there are delays in hiring required personnel our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be seriously harmed 

also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that such personnel has been improperly solicited that such personnel has divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that former employers own certain inventions or other work product such claims could result in litigation please see “we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us” 

our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations our employment arrangements with our employees do not require that they continue to work for us for any specified period and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of our key personnel including jayshree ullal our chief executive officer andy bechtolsheim our founder and chief development officer and kenneth duda our founder chief technology officer and svp software engineering or other members of our senior management team sales and marketing team or engineering team or any difficulty attracting or retaining other highly qualified personnel in the future could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are subject to a number of risks associated with the expansion of our international sales and operations 

our ability to grow our business and our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide we have a limited history of marketing selling and supporting our products and services internationally operating in a global marketplace we are subject to risks associated with having an international reach and requirements such as compliance with applicable anticorruption laws 

one such applicable anticorruption law is the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and its employees and intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business securing an advantage and directing business to another and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors officers employees agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives as such if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation governmental authorities in the us and elsewhere could seek to impose civil andor criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions failure to comply with anticorruption and antibribery laws such as the fcpa and the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 or the uk bribery act and similar laws associated with our activities outside the us could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences we intend to increase our international sales and business and as such the risk of violating laws such as the fcpa and uk bribery act increases 

additionally as a result of our international reach we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or to recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the us and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in endcustomer contracts although to date we generally have not done so to the extent that we may enter into endcustomer contracts in the future that include nonstandard terms related to payment warranties or performance obligations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 

 these and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenue and consequently materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects expanding our existing international operations and entering into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial commitments our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit our future growth or materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings and our failure to offer highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

once our products are deployed within our end customers’ networks our end customers depend on our support organization and our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products highquality support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products if we or our channel partners do not assist our end customers in deploying our products effectively do not succeed 

in helping our end customers resolve postdeployment issues quickly or do not provide adequate ongoing support it could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing end customers and could harm our reputation with potential end customers in addition as we expand our operations internationally our support organization will face additional challenges including those associated with delivering support training and documentation in languages other than english our failure or the failure of our channel partners to maintain highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology and network infrastructure spending may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology network connectivity and access to data and applications weak domestic or global economic conditions fear or anticipation of such conditions or a reduction in information technology and network infrastructure spending even if economic conditions improve could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our distributors reduced unit sales and lower or no growth for example the ongoing debt concerns in many countries in europe have caused and are likely to continue to cause uncertainty and instability in local economies and in global financial markets particularly if any future sovereign debt defaults or significant bank failures or defaults occur market uncertainty and instability in europe could intensify or spread further particularly if ongoing stabilization efforts prove insufficient concerns have been raised as to the financial political and legal ineffectiveness of measures taken to date continuing or worsening economic instability in europe and elsewhere could adversely affect spending for it network infrastructure systems and tools continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may also affect the overall demand for our products although we do not believe that our business financial condition results of operations and prospects have been significantly adversely affected by economic and political uncertainty in europe and other countries deterioration of such conditions may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in the future a prolonged period of economic uncertainty or a downturn may also significantly affect financing markets the availability of capital and the terms and conditions of financing arrangements including the overall cost of financing as well as the financial health or creditworthiness of our end customers circumstances may arise in which we need or desire to raise additional capital and such capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 

from time to time we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent copyright commercial product liability employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims in addition to governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources cause us to incur significant expenses or liability andor require us to change our business practices because of the potential risks expenses and uncertainties of litigation we may from time to time settle disputes even where we have meritorious claims or defenses by agreeing to settlement agreements because litigation is inherently unpredictable we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

for more information regarding the litigation in which we are currently involved see the “legal proceedings” subheading in in note 5 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights or other lawsuits asserted against us could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network infrastructure industry and have resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies many companies in the network infrastructure industry including our competitors and other third parties as well as nonpracticing entities own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us from time to time they have or may in the future also assert such claims against us our end customers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties 

as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur claims of infringement misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase any claim of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim distract our management from our business and require us to cease use of such intellectual property in addition some claims for patent infringement may relate to subcomponents that we purchase from third parties if these third parties are unable or unwilling to indemnify us for these claims we could be substantially harmed 

the patent portfolios of most of our competitors are larger than ours this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent crosslicenses in addition future assertions of patent rights by third parties and any resulting litigation may involve patent holding companies 

or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection we cannot assure you that we are not infringing or otherwise violating any thirdparty intellectual property rights 

the thirdparty asserters of intellectual property claims may be unreasonable in their demands or may simply refuse to settle which could lead to expensive settlement payments prolonged periods of litigation and related expenses additional burdens on employees or other resources distraction from our business supply stoppages and lost sales 

an adverse outcome of a dispute including those lawsuits described under the “legal proceedings” subheading in note 5 commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k may require us to pay substantial damages or penalties including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party’s patents cease making licensing or using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others expend additional development resources to attempt to redesign our products or services or otherwise to develop noninfringing technology which may not be successful enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or intellectual property rights and indemnify our partners and other third parties any damages penalties or royalty obligations we may become subject to as a result of an adverse outcome and any thirdparty indemnity we may need to provide could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects royalty or licensing agreements if required or desirable may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures further there is little or no information publicly available concerning market or fair values for license fees which can lead to overpayment of license or settlement fees in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us suppliers subject to thirdparty intellectual property claims also may choose or be forced to discontinue or alter their arrangements with us with little or no advance notice to us any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our standard sales contracts contain indemnification provisions requiring us to defend our end customers against thirdparty claims including against infringement of certain intellectual property rights that could expose us to losses which could seriously harm our business financial conditions results of operations and prospects 

under the indemnification provisions of our standard sales contracts we agree to defend our end customers and channel partners against thirdparty claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights which may include patents copyrights trademarks or trade secrets and to pay judgments entered on such claims for example we are currently involved in ongoing cisco litigation claims before the usitc an adverse ruling in such litigation may potentially expose us to claims in the event that claims are brought against our customers based on the ruling and we are required to indemnify such customers 

our exposure under these indemnification provisions is frequently limited to the total amount paid by our end customer under the agreement however certain agreements include indemnification provisions that could potentially expose us to losses in excess of the amount received under the agreement any of these events including claims for indemnification could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights 

we depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology we rely on trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection 

the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner we may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions further we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims to the extent that additional patents are issued from our patent applications which is not certain they may be contested circumvented or invalidated in the future moreover the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages and as with any technology competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future in addition we rely on confidentiality or license agreements with third parties in connection with their use of our products and technology there is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements or that we will be able to adequately enforce our rights in part because we rely on “shrinkwrap” licenses in some instances 

we have not registered our trademarks in all geographic markets failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our ability to enforce and defend our trademark rights and result in indemnification claims further any claim of infringement by a third party even those claims without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claim could divert management attention from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property in certain geographic markets 

despite our efforts the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the united states 

detecting and protecting against the unauthorized use of our products technology and proprietary rights is expensive difficult and in some cases impossible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources either of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and there is no guarantee that we would be successful furthermore many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to protecting their technology or intellectual property rights than we do accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property which could result in a substantial loss of our market share 

we rely on the availability of licenses to thirdparty software and other intellectual property 

many of our products and services include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties and we otherwise use software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties in our business this exposes us to risks over which we may have little or no control for example a licensor may have difficulties keeping up with technological changes or may stop supporting the software or other intellectual property that it licenses to us also it will be necessary in the future to renew licenses expand the scope of existing licenses or seek new licenses relating to various aspects of these products and services or otherwise relating to our business which may result in increased license fees these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms if at all in addition a third party may assert that we or our end customers are in breach of the terms of a license which could among other things give such third party the right to terminate a license or seek damages from us or both the inability to obtain or maintain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain or maintain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in releases of products and services and could otherwise disrupt our business until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and services or otherwise in the conduct of our business moreover the inclusion in our products and services of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis may limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software that we use if we combine our software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release portions of the source code of our software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products moreover we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products will be effective if we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products on terms that are not economically feasible to reengineer our products to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available in source code form our proprietary code any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

sales of our 7000 series of switches generate most of our product revenue and if we are unable to continue to grow sales of these products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

historically we have derived substantially all of our product revenue from sales of our 7000 series of switches and we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future we have experienced declines in sales prices for our products including our 10 gigabit ethernet modular and fixed switches a decline in the price of our 7000 series of switches and related services or our inability to increase sales of these products would harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects more seriously than if we derived significant revenue from a larger variety of product lines and services our future financial performance will also depend upon successfully developing and selling nextgeneration versions of our 7000 series of switches if we fail to deliver new products new features or new releases that end customers want and that allow us to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and to be adversely affected by numerous factors 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and to be affected by numerous factors including 



 to remain competitive we must successfully manage product introductions and transitions 

the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of new merchant silicon chips the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly we cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on our business and results of operations 

our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense as a result our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly 

the timing of our sales and revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of our products’ sales cycles a sales cycle is the period between initial contact with a prospective end customer and any sale of our products endcustomer orders often involve the purchase of multiple products these orders are complex and difficult to complete because prospective end customers generally consider a number of factors over an extended period of time before committing to purchase the products and solutions we sell end customers especially in the case of our large end customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision and require considerable time to evaluate test and qualify our products prior to making a purchase decision and placing an order the length of time that end customers devote to their evaluation contract negotiation and budgeting processes varies significantly our products’ sales cycles can be lengthy in certain cases especially with respect to our prospective large end customers during the sales cycle we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities and make investments in evaluation equipment all of which lower our operating margins particularly if no sale occurs even if an end customer decides to purchase our products there are many factors affecting the timing of our recognition of revenue which makes our revenue difficult to forecast for example there may be unexpected delays in an end customer’s internal procurement processes particularly for some of our larger end customers for which our products represent a very small percentage of their total procurement activity there are many other factors specific to end customers that contribute to the timing of their purchases and the variability of our revenue recognition including the strategic importance of a particular project to an end customer budgetary constraints and changes in their personnel 

even after an end customer makes a purchase there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase for example the sale of our products may be subject to acceptance testing in addition the significance and timing of our product enhancements and the introduction of new products by our competitors may also affect end customers’ purchases for all of these reasons it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed the particular period in which a sale will be completed or the period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized if our sales cycles lengthen our revenue could be lower than expected which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on end customers renewing their maintenance and support contracts any decline in maintenance renewals could harm our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we typically sell our products with maintenance and support as part of the initial purchase and a portion of our annual revenue comes from renewals of maintenance and support contracts our end customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance and support 

contracts after the expiration of the initial period and they may elect not to renew their maintenance and support contracts to renew their maintenance and support contracts at lower prices through alternative channel partners or to reduce the product quantity under their maintenance and support contracts thereby reducing our future revenue from maintenance and support contracts if our end customers especially our large end customers do not renew their maintenance and support contracts or if they renew them on terms that are less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

most of our competitors have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example in the last few years alone dell acquired force10 and emc ibm acquired blade network technology hewlett packard enterprises purchased aruba juniper acquired contrail cisco acquired insieme and broadcom which currently intends to acquire brocade 

moreover large system vendors are increasingly seeking to deliver toptobottom cloud networking solutions to end customers that combine cloudfocused hardware and software solutions to provide an alternative to our products 

we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete with us including any competitors that seek to become sole source vendors for end customers this could lead to more variability in our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release they have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our end customers’ willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our products could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our products could result in claims by end customers for losses that they sustain if end customers make these types of claims we may be required or may choose for endcustomer relations or other reasons to expend additional resources in order to address the problem we may also be required to repair or replace such products or provide a refund for the purchase price for such products liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale and those of our resellers and distributors may not be enforceable under some circumstances or may not fully or effectively protect us from endcustomer claims and related liabilities and costs including indemnification obligations under our agreements with end customers resellers and distributors the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain types of claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any such claims in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in expenditures of funds in connection with litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

in addition to our own direct sales force we rely on distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers to sell our products and our failure to effectively develop manage or prevent disruptions to our distribution channels and the processes and procedures that support them could cause a reduction in the number of end customers of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon maintaining our relationships with distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers and establishing additional sales channel relationships we anticipate that sales of our products to a limited number of channel partners will continue to account for a material portion of our total product revenue for the foreseeable future we provide our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our products but these steps may not be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services if we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive programs for our channel partners we may not be able to incentivize these partners to sell our products to end customers these partners may have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our products altogether one of our channel partners could elect to consolidate or enter into a strategic partnership with one of our competitors which could reduce or eliminate our future opportunities with that channel partner our agreements with our channel partners may generally be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice we may be unable to retain these channel partners or secure additional or replacement channel partners the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners requires extensive training and any new or expanded relationship with a channel partner may take several months or more to achieve productivity 

where we rely on the channel partners for sales of our products we may have little or no contact with the ultimate users of our products that purchase through such channel partners thereby making it more difficult for us to establish brand awareness ensure proper 

delivery and installation of our products service ongoing endcustomer requirements estimate endcustomer demand and respond to evolving endcustomer needs in addition our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to end customers fail to comply with their contractual obligations or violate laws or our corporate policies if we fail to effectively manage our existing sales channels or if our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our products if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of highquality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

we anticipate increasing our sales efforts to us and foreign federal state and local governmental end customers in the future sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we have attained revised certifications government demand and payment for our products and services may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects selling to government entities may also require us to comply with various regulations that are not applicable to sales to nongovernment entities including regulations that may relate to pricing classified material and other matters complying with such regulations may also require us to put in place controls and procedures to monitor compliance with the applicable regulations that may be costly or not possible we are not currently certified to perform work under classified contracts with government entities failure to comply with any such regulations could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government ceasing to buy our products and services a reduction of revenue fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the us government may require certain products that it purchases to be manufactured in the us and other relatively highcost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet these requirements any of these and other circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products must interoperate with operating systems software applications and hardware that is developed by others and if we are unable to devote the necessary resources to ensure that our products interoperate with such software and hardware we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening demand for our products 

generally our products comprise only a part of the data center and must interoperate with our end customers’ existing infrastructure specifically their networks servers software and operating systems which may be manufactured by a wide variety of vendors and original equipment manufacturers or oems our products must comply with established industry standards in order to interoperate with the servers storage software and other networking equipment in the data center such that all systems function efficiently together we depend on the vendors of servers and systems in a data center to support prevailing industry standards often these vendors are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are also some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our end customers 

in addition when new or updated versions of these software operating systems or applications are introduced we must sometimes develop updated versions of our software so that our products will interoperate properly we may not accomplish these development efforts quickly costeffectively or at all these development efforts require capital investment and the devotion of engineering resources if we fail to maintain compatibility with these systems and applications our end customers may not be able to adequately utilize our products and we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening in demand for our products among other consequences which would adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls 

our products may be subject to various export controls and because we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products certain of our products may be exported from various countries only with the required export license or through an export license exception if we were to fail to comply with the applicable export control laws customs regulations economic sanctions or other applicable laws we could be subject to monetary damages or the imposition of restrictions which could be material to our business operating results and prospects and could also harm our reputation further there could be criminal penalties for knowing or willful violations including incarceration for culpable employees and managers obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities furthermore certain export control and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products technology software and services to embargoed countries and sanctioned governments entities and persons even though we take precautions to ensure that our channel partners comply with all relevant regulations any failure by our channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences including reputational harm government investigations and penalties 

as our company grows we also continue developing procedures and controls to comply with export control and other applicable laws historically we have had some instances where we inadvertently have not fully complied with certain export control laws but we have disclosed them to and implemented corrective actions with the appropriate government agencies 

in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including through import permit and license requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our end customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential end customers with international operations or create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business is subject to regulation by various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the united states from time to time we may receive inquiries from such governmental agencies or we may make voluntary disclosures regarding our compliance with applicable governmental regulations or requirements relating to importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations which could lead to formal investigations noncompliance with applicable government regulations or requirements could subject us to sanctions mandatory product recalls enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages civil and criminal penalties or injunctions if any governmental sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected in addition responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we may invest in or acquire other businesses which could require significant management attention disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we may make investments in complementary companies products or technologies which could involve licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in or acquisitions of other companies however we do not have significant experience in making investments in other companies nor have we made any acquisitions to date and as a result our ability as an organization to evaluate andor complete investments or acquire and integrate other companies products or technologies in a successful manner is unproven we may not be able to find suitable investment or acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete such investments or acquisitions on favorable terms if at all if we do complete investments or acquisitions we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and any investments or acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end customers investors and securities analysts 

in addition investments and acquisitions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures for example if we are unsuccessful at integrating any acquisitions or retaining key talent from those acquisitions or the technologies associated with such acquisitions into our company the business financial condition results of operations and prospects of the combined company could be adversely affected any integration process may require significant time and resources and we may not be able to manage the process successfully we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel or accurately forecast the financial effects of an acquisition transaction including accounting charges we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such investment or acquisition each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of 

indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations moreover if the investment or acquisition becomes impaired we may be required to take an impairment charge which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock 

if we needed to raise additional capital to expand our operations and invest in new products our failure to do so on favorable terms could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future if we did need to raise additional funds to expand our operations and invest in new products we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms if at all if we raise additional equity financing our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our common stock could decline furthermore if we engage in debt financing the holders of such debt would have priority over the holders of common stock and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or impose other restrictions on our business we may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders including maintaining specified liquidity or other ratios any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms if at all we may not be able to among other things 

 our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as described in part ii item 7 of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities equity revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation contract manufacturing liabilities and income taxes if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions our results of operations may be adversely affected and may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

we are exposed to the credit risk of our channel partners and some of our end customers which could result in material losses   

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with standard payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the us we monitor individual endcustomer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the end customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts we are unable to recognize revenue from shipments until the collection of those amounts becomes reasonably assured any significant delay or default in the collection of significant accounts receivable could result in an increased need for us to obtain working capital from other sources possibly on worse terms than we could have negotiated if we had established such working capital resources prior to such delays or defaults any significant default could adversely affect our results of operations and delay our ability to recognize revenue 

a material portion of our sales is derived through our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers some of our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers may experience financial difficulties which could adversely affect our collection of accounts receivable distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other systems integrators valueadded resellers and end customers distributors represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be less likely to have the reserve resources required to meet payment obligations our exposure to credit risks of our channel partners may increase if our channel partners and their end customers are adversely affected by global or regional economic conditions one or more of these channel partners could delay payments or default on credit extended to them either of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we or our partners fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition results of operations prospects and reputation could be adversely affected 

we and our partners including our contract manufacturers are subject to various local state federal and international environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection recycling and disposal of electrical and electronic equipment examples of these laws and regulations include the european union or eu restrictions on the use of hazardous substances directive or rohs directive and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive or weee directive as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the us and we or our partners including our contract manufacturers are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

the eu rohs directive and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products our products currently comply with the rohs directive however if there are future changes to this directive we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes our failure or the failure of our partners including our contract manufacturers to comply with past present and future environmental laws could result in fines penalties thirdparty claims reduced sales of our products substantial product inventory writeoffs and reputational damage any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we also expect that our business will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis applicable to us and our partners including our contract manufacturers to date our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows although we cannot predict the future effect of such laws or regulations they will likely result in additional costs or require us to change the content or manufacturing of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening us dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our end customers outside of the us which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase our product and operating costs in foreign locations further an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the us is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates if we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with the currency fluctuations our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

our corporate headquarters and the operations of our key manufacturing vendors logistics providers and partners as well as many of our customers are located in areas exposed to risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis including the san francisco bay area japan and taiwan a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake tsunami fire or a flood or other catastrophic event such as a disease outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our or their business which could in turn materially affect our financial condition results of operations and prospects for example in the event our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed which could result in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter further if a natural disaster occurs in a region from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue end customers in that region may delay or forego purchases of our products which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturer logistics providers partners or end customers or the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end any disruption in the business of our manufacturer logistics providers partners or end customers that affects sales at the end of our quarter could have a particularly significant adverse effect on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if our disaster recovery plans and those of our manufacturers logistics providers or partners prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of endcustomer orders or delays in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected 

breaches of our cybersecurity systems could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services to our customers delay our ability to recognize revenue compromise the integrity of our software products result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property damage our reputation expose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data 

we increasingly depend upon our it systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or that of our website and misappropriate our proprietary information or cause interruptions of our service because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system we have also outsourced a number of our business functions to thirdparties including our manufacturers logistics providers and cloud service providers and our business operations also depend in part on the success of these third parties own cybersecurity measures similarly we rely upon distributors resellers and system integrators to sell our products and our sales operations depend in part on the reliability of their cybersecurity measures additionally we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our it resources in safe and secure fashion that does not expose our network systems to security breaches and the loss of data accordingly if our cybersecurity systems and those of our contractors fail to protect against unauthorized access sophisticated cyber attacks and the mishandling of data by our employees and contractors our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways including 

 should any of the above events occur we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our customers and regulatory actions from governmental agencies in addition our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised and our reputation and competitive position could be significantly harmed also the regulatory and contractual actions litigations investigations fines penalties and liabilities relating to data breaches that result in losses of personally identifiable or credit card information of users of our services can be significant in terms of fines and reputational impact and necessitate changes to our business operations that may be disruptive to us additionally we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and remediate damages consequently our financial performance and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we believe our longterm value as a company will be greater if we focus primarily on growth instead of profitability 

our business strategy is to focus primarily on our longterm growth as a result our profitability in any given period may be lower than it would be if our strategy was to maximize shortterm profitability expenditures on research and development sales and marketing infrastructure and other such investments may not ultimately grow our business prospects or cause long term profitability for example in order to support our strong growth we have accelerated our investment in infrastructure such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations as a result we expect our levels of operating profit could decline in the short to medium term if we are ultimately unable to achieve or maintain profitability at the level anticipated by analysts and our stockholders the market price of our common stock may decline 

we may not generate positive returns on our research and development investments 

developing our products is expensive and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  our research and development expenses were 2736 million  or approximately 242  of our revenue 2094 million or approximately 250 of our revenue and 1489 million or approximately 255 of our revenue respectively we expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts by investing in research and development we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity we expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these investments these investments may take several years to generate positive returns if ever 

we provide access to our software and other selected source code to certain partners which creates additional risk that our competitors could develop products that are similar to or better than ours 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our internally developed technology which is incorporated in the source code for our products we seek to protect the source code design code documentation and other information relating to our software under trade secret patent and copyright laws however we have chosen to provide access to selected source code of our software to several of our partners for codevelopment as well as for open application programming interfaces or apis formats and protocols though we generally control access to our source code and other intellectual property and enter into confidentiality or license agreements with such partners as well as with our employees and consultants this combination of procedural and contractual safeguards may be insufficient to protect our trade secrets and other rights to our technology our protective measures may be inadequate especially because we may not be able to prevent our partners employees or consultants from violating any agreements or licenses we may have in place or abusing their access granted to our source code improper disclosure or use of our source code could help competitors develop products similar to or better than ours 

changes in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application of existing tax laws of various jurisdictions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

  our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including earnings that are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our ability to generate and use tax attributes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the federal research and development rd” tax credit laws transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement and legal structure tax effects of nondeductible compensation including certain stockbased compensation tax costs related to intercompany realignments changes in accounting principles adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries or customers a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings or changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules 

  significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions and determine our provision for income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital in addition tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied recent changes to us tax laws including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the us are repatriated to the us as well as changes to us tax laws that may be enacted in the future could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings as well as cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain outside of the us furthermore due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change 

  further we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities audits by the internal revenue service or other tax authorities are subject to inherent uncertainties and could result in unfavorable outcomes including potential fines or penalties as we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions the expense of defending and resolving such an audit may be significant the amount of time to resolve an audit is also unpredictable and may divert management’s attention from our business operations we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we cannot assure you that fluctuations in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application or interpretation of existing tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns by tax authorities will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we do not effectively expand and train our direct sales force we may be unable to add new end customers or increase sales to our existing end customers and our business will be adversely affected 

we depend on our direct sales force to obtain new end customers and increase sales with existing end customers as such we have invested and will continue to invest in our sales organization in recent periods we have been adding personnel and other resources to our sales function as we focus on growing our business entering new markets and increasing our market share and we expect to incur additional expenses in expanding our sales personnel in order to achieve revenue growth there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training retaining and integrating sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth particularly in international markets new hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect and we may be unable to hire retain or integrate into our corporate culture sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business in addition because we continue to grow rapidly a large percentage of our sales force is new to our company if we are unable to hire integrate and train a sufficient number of effective sales personnel or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new end customers 

or increasing sales to our existing endcustomer base our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected 

regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products 

as a public company we are subject to requirements under the doddfrank that will require us to perform diligence and disclose and report whether or not our products contain conflict minerals the implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements including costs related to conducting diligence procedures and if applicable potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities we may also face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflictfree or if we are unable to alter our products processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials 

risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock   

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the value of your investment could decline 

the trading price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to continue to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following 

 in addition technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility and if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company if the market price of our common stock is volatile we may become the target of securities litigation securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business and prospects this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that such sales might occur could reduce the market price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us 

based on approximately 708 million shares outstanding as of december 31 2016  holders of approximately 274 of our common stock have rights subject to some conditions to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to 

include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders in addition we have registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans if holders by exercising their registration rights sell large numbers of shares it could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we may also issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in connection with a financing acquisition our equity incentive plans or otherwise any such issuances would result in dilution to our existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

insiders have substantial control over us which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions including a change of control 

our directors executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 10 of our outstanding common stock together with their affiliates in the aggregate beneficially own approximately 278 of the outstanding shares of our common stock   based on shares outstanding as of december 31 2016  as a result these stockholders if acting together could exercise a significant level of influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests this concentration of ownership may also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock or otherwise may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change of control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock 

we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared nor paid any dividends on our common stock we intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and prospects and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases 

if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business or prospects the market price of our common stock and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock to some extent depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business or prospects we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares the market price of our common stock would likely decline if one or more of these analysts should cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which could cause the market price of our common stock or trading volume to decline 

our charter documents and delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 



 in addition as a delaware corporation we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law these provisions may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time 

the issuance of additional stock in connection with financings acquisitions investments our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1000000000 shares of common stock and up to 100000000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations we may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing acquisition investment our stock incentive plans or otherwise we may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the then market price of our common stock any issuance of stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline

overview 

we are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration data centers for enterprise support our cloud networking solutions consist of our extensible operating system or eos a set of network applications and our ethernet switching and routing platforms our cloud networking solutions deliver industryleading performance scalability availability programmability automation and visibility at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was purposebuilt to be fully programmable and highly modular the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services 

as of december 31 2016  we have shipped more than 10 million cloud networking ports worldwide we have experienced rapid revenue growth over the last several years increasing our revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 519  from 2011 to 2016  as we have grown the functionality of our eos software expanded the range of our product portfolio and increased the size of our sales force our revenue has continued to grow rapidly our revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  was 11 billion  an increase of 348  compared to 2015  we have been profitable and cash flow positive for each year since 2010 

we believe that our cloud networking platform addresses the large and growing cloud networking segment of data center switching which remains in the early stage of adoption we expect to continue growing our organization to meet the needs of new and existing customers as they increasingly realize the performance and cost benefits of our cloud networking solutions and as they expand their cloud networks we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our rapid development of new features and applications we intend to continue expanding our sales and marketing teams and programs and carrying out associated marketing activities in key geographies in order to support our strong growth we have and may continue to accelerate our investment in infrastructure such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations for a description of factors that may impact our future performance see the disclosure in the section titled factors affecting our performance below 

our business model 

we derive revenue from sales of products and services we generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our eos software we generate the majority of our services revenue from post contract support or pcs which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products 

since shipping our first products in 2008 our cumulative endcustomer base has grown rapidly between december 31 2011 and december 31 2016  our cumulative endcustomer base grew from approximately 1100 to over 4200  our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others 

to continue to grow our revenue it is important that we both obtain new customers and sell additional products to existing customers our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our eos software and enhancements to eos we engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture today we combine our eos software with merchant silicon into a family of switching and routing products this enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions we currently procure certain merchant silicon components from multiple vendors and we continue to expand our relationships with these and other vendors we work closely with third party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third party direct fulfillment facilities we and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling final configuration quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers we have expanded our contract manufacturing capabilities to include sanmina as an additional contract manufacturer 

we market and sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners including distributors valueadded resellers system integrators original equipment manufacturer or oem partners and in conjunction with various technology partners to facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity we have created a partner program the arista partner program to engage partners who provide valueadded services and extend our reach into the marketplace authorized training partners provide technical training to our channel partners our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for presales technical 

support and engineering for our end customers each sales team is responsible for a geographic territory has responsibility for a number of major direct endcustomer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market 

factors affecting our performance 

we believe that our future success will depend on many factors including our ability to expand sales to our existing customers as well as to add new end customers while these areas present significant opportunity they also present risks that we must manage to ensure successful results see the section titled “risk factors” additionally we face intense competition especially from larger wellestablished companies and we must continue to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform to succeed in our market we are also currently engaged in several lawsuits with cisco our largest competitor whereby they claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we intend to vigorously defend against these cisco lawsuits as summarized in the legal proceedings section below however we cannot be certain that   any claims by cisco would be resolved in our favor if we are unable to address these challenges our business could be adversely affected 

increasing adoption of cloud networks networks are subject to increasing performance requirements due to the growing number of connected devices as well as new enterprise and consumer applications computing architectures are evolving to meet the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications we believe that cloud networks will continue to replace legacy network technologies our business and results of operations will be significantly affected by the speed with which organizations implement cloud networks 

expanding sales to existing customer base we expect that a substantial portion of our future sales will be followon sales to existing end customers as noted above one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our cloud networking solutions thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers we believe this opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing and expected infrastructure spend we expect our business and results of operations will depend on our ability to sell additional products to our growing base of customers 

adding new end customers we believe that the cloud networking market is still in the early stages of adoption we intend to target new end customers by continuing to invest in our field sales force and extending our relationships with channel technology and systemlevel partners to date we have primarily targeted end customers with the largest cloud data centers a typical initial order involves the education of prospective customers about the technical merits and capabilities and potential cost savings of our products as compared to our competitors’ products our results of operations will depend on our ability to continue to add new customers we believe that customer references have been and will continue to be an important factor in winning new business with special emphasis on four key verticals the cloud titans financial services service and internet hosting providers and high tech enterprises 

selling more complex and higherperformance configurations  our results of operations have been and we believe will continue to be affected by our ability to sell more complex and higherperformance configurations of our products our ability to sustain our revenue growth will depend in part upon our continued sales of these more robust configurations and quarterly results of operations can be significantly impacted by the mix of products and product configurations sold during the period 

leveraging channel partners we expect to continue to derive a growing portion of our sales through our channel partners as they develop new end customers and expand sales to our existing end customers we plan to continue to invest in our network of channel partners to enable them to reach new end customers more effectively increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support effectively we believe that increasing channel leverage will extend and improve our engagement with a broad set of customers 

investing in research and development for growth we believe that the market for cloud networking is still in the early stages of adoption and we intend to continue investing for longterm growth we expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products such as our 7280r platform 7500r series and 7160 series new releases and upgrades to our eos software and new applications building upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts by investing in research and development we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity we expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these product development investments 

customer concentration and timing of large orders  historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for significant portion of our revenue during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  our largest end customer accounted for 164  120  and 149  of our revenue respectively we have also experienced and continue to experience customer concentration on a quarterly basis in addition we have experienced increases in the size of our orders including orders from existing customers which could result in future increased customer concentration depending on the timing of the fulfillment of those orders we have also experienced unpredictability in the timing of large orders especially with respect to our large end customers due to the complexity of orders the time it takes end customers to evaluate test qualify and accept our products and factors specific to our end customers due to these factors we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis in addition we have provided and may in the future provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers 

components of operating results 

revenue 

we generate revenue primarily from sales of our products which incorporate our eos software we also derive a portion of our revenue from sales of post contract support or pcs and to a lesser extent professional services we generate pcs revenue from sales of technical support services contracts that are typically purchased in conjunction with our products and subsequent renewals of those contracts we expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on among other things the timing and size of orders the delivery and acceptance of products and the impact of significant transactions with unique terms and conditions that may require deferral of revenue 

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our thirdparty contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors overhead costs in our manufacturing operations department and other manufacturingrelated costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory we expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases cost of providing pcs and other services consists primarily of personnel costs for our global customer support organization 

gross margin 

gross margin or gross profit as a percentage of revenue has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing the average sales price of our offerings manufacturingrelated costs including costs associated with the introduction of additional contract manufacturing capacity merchant silicon costs supply chain sourcing and the mix of products sold we expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above and others 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs personnel costs consist of wages benefits bonuses and with respect to sales and marketing expenses sales commissions personnel costs also include stockbased compensation and travel expenses we expect operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as we continue to invest in the growth of our business 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs with the remainder being prototype expenses thirdparty engineering and contractor support costs and an allocated portion of facility and it costs and depreciation our research and development efforts are focused on maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products and on new product development including new releases and upgrades to our eos software and applications we expense research and development costs as incurred we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and also include costs related to marketing and promotional activities with the remainder being an allocated portion of facility and it costs and depreciation we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide and expand our relationships with current and future channel partners and end customers 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs legal and professional fees and an allocated portion of facility and it costs and depreciation general and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive finance human resources and legal functions our professional services costs are primarily due to external legal accounting and tax services 

other income expense net 

interest expense 

interest expense consists primarily of interest expense from our lease financing obligation in fiscal 2014 interest expense also included interest expense on our subordinated convertible promissory notes including our related party subordinated convertible promissory notes which were converted during fiscal 2014 

other income expense 

other income expense consists primarily of interest income on marketable securities and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in addition during fiscal 2014 other income expense consisted of gains on investments and writeoffs of debt discount on 

notes payable which were repaid and converted during fiscal 2014 we expect our foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

provision for income taxes 

we operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to us income tax generally our us tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these earnings which avoids double taxation our tax expense to date consists of federal state and foreign current and deferred income taxes 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes historical results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of revenue for those periods we have derived the data for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  from our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in thus form 10k in thousands except for percentage of revenue

revenue cost of revenue and gross profit in thousands except percentages 

revenue by geography in thousands except percentages 



revenue 

product revenue increased 2465 million  or 331  in the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 2015  the increase during the period was primarily driven by increased shipments to our existing customers as they continue to grow and expand their businesses increasing their demand for our products and related accessories the introduction of new products contributed to our revenue growth both with existing and new customers as of december 31 2016  we have shipped more than 10 million cumulative cloud networking ports worldwide and our overall endcustomer base has exceeded 4200 service revenue increased 487  in the year ended december 31 2016  as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand we also continued to experience pressure in product and service pricing due to competitive market conditions however this pricing pressure was more than offset by the increased demand drivers outlined above 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

cost of revenue increased 1120 million  or 381  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the same period in 2015  the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase in product shipment volumes in addition we incurred increased costs as we added capacity to our manufacturing and operations infrastructure gross margin decreased from 649  to 640  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the same period in 2015  the decrease during the period was primarily the result of changes in customer mix as we expanded our business including increased contributions from larger customers who typically receive higher discount levels and increased costs associated with the expansion of manufacturing and operations capacity these unfavorable changes were partially offset by improved service margins as we scale our services business we expect our gross margins in the first quarter of 2017 will reflect some further increases in product costs as we continue to invest in expanded contract manufacturing and supply chain operations 

operating expenses in thousands except percentages 

research and development 

research and development expenses increased 641 million  or 306  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the same period in 2015  the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 312 million resulting from an increase in compensation costs including stockbased compensation and corporate bonus expense primarily driven by headcount growth prototype spend and thirdparty engineering and consulting costs increased by 273 million related to additional outsourced development projects increased internal development activity related to new products and increased costs associated with litigationrelated changes in product design facilities and it infrastructure costs increased 31 million primarily due to continued expansion and support of our research and development activities 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses increased 218 million  or 200  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the same period in 2015  the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 210 million reflecting increased compensation costs including sales incentive compensation and corporate bonus expense primarily driven by headcount growth and higher sales volumes in addition sales and customer engineering consulting expenses mostly related to international expansion increased by 13 million and marketing promotion trade shows and events increased by 11 million as compared to the same period in 2015  the increase was partially offset by a decrease in product field demonstration costs of 17 million primarily related to significant costs incurred in the previous year due to several next generation product transitions 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses decreased 05 million  or 06  for the year ended december 31 2016  compared to the same period in 2015  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in litigation expenses of 56 million during the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  this decrease was primarily related to the timing of litigation activities associated with the cisco and optumsoft legal matters outlined in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements this decrease was largely offset by an increase in personnel costs of 49 million in the year ended december 31 2016  as compared to the same period in 2015  this reflects increased compensation costs including increased stockbased compensation and corporate bonus expense primarily driven by headcount growth 

other income expense net in thousands except percentages 

other income expense net improved during the year ended december 31 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to a net increase in interest income as we expanded our marketable securities portfolio 

provision for income taxes in thousands except percentages 

provision for income taxes was approximately 580 million  and 249 million  for the year ended december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively the change in our provision was primarily due to an increase in profit before income taxes the increase in the provision was also a result of additional state and foreign taxes nondeductible permanent differences offset by a shift in the geographic foreign 

earnings mix taxed at a lower rate than the us tax rate for further information regarding income taxes and the impact on our results of operations and financial position see notes to consolidated financial statements  note 8 income taxes

revenue by geography in thousands except percentages 



revenue 

product revenue increased 2133 million  or 401  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to 2014  we increased shipments to our existing customers during the year as they continued to grow their businesses and increase their demand for our products and related accessories in addition we continued to add new customers as we expanded our market presence and geographic footprint service revenue increased 764  in the year ended december 31 2015 with growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand we also continued to experience fluctuations in product and service pricing due to competitive market pressures however these were more than offset by the increased demand drivers outlined above 

cost of revenue and gross margin 

gross margin decreased from 671  to 649  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  this decrease in 2015 was primarily due to increased inventoryrelated obsolescence charges associated with upcoming product transitions and higher warranty costs in addition to a greater mix of revenue from larger customers who typically receive higher discounts 

operating expenses in thousands except percentages 

research and development 

research and development expenses increased 605 million  or 407  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 333 million resulting from headcount growth which drove an increase in compensation including stock based compensation as well as additional bonus expense under our corporate bonus plan prototype spend and thirdparty engineering and consulting costs increased by 142 million and facilities and it infrastructure costs increased 86 million due to new product introductions and the continued expansion and support of our research and development activities 

sales and marketing 

sales and marketing expenses increased 237 million  or 278  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 170 million resulting from increased compensation including sales commissions which was driven by headcount growth and higher sales volumes the increase also related to additional product field demonstration costs of 60 million 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses increased 434 million  or 1342  for the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  the increase was due to an increase in legal fees of 398 million primarily related to the cisco and optumsoft legal matters outlined in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in addition personnel costs increased by 41 million primarily reflecting additional corporate bonus expense and increased stockbased compensation charges during 2015 

other income expense net in thousands except percentages 

interest expense the reduction in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  is primarily related to repayment and conversion of our notes payable upon closing of our initial public offering during the second quarter of 2014 

other income expense net  the unfavorable change in other income expense net during the year ended december 31 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  was primarily due to a onetime gain on our notes receivable of 40 million in 2014 partially offset by a 07 million writeoff related to the debt discount on notes payable during the second quarter of 2014 and a reduction in transactional exchange rate losses during 2015 

provision for income taxes in thousands except percentages 

provision for income taxes was approximately 249 million  and 347 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively the decrease in our provision was the result of foreign mix earnings taxed at a lower rate than the us tax rate release of reserves due to expiration of the statute of limitations in certain domestic jurisdictions and reinstatement of the federal rd credit during 2015 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the provision due to increased profit before income taxes 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations as of december 31 2016  cash and cash equivalents were 5679 million  of which approximately 1117 million  was held outside the us in our foreign subsidiaries we have not repatriated nor do we currently have plans to repatriate these funds but if we were to repatriate cash held outside of the us for domestic cash operations we would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes to repatriate these funds less any previously paid foreign income taxes we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2016  to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us income taxes have been provided thereon 

our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes we plan to continue to invest for longterm growth we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for the foreseeable future our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities the 

timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings our costs associated with supply chain activities and manufacturing operations our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies the continued market acceptance of our products and costs incurred related to outstanding litigation claims if we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

cash flows 



cash flows from operating activities 

our primary source of cash from operating activities has been from cash collections from our customers we expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increased sales and timing of collections our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs inventory purchases from our contract manufacturer investment in research and development and litigation expenses 

during the year ended december 31 2016 cash provided by operating activities was 1314 million  primarily from net income of 1842 million  with noncash adjustments to net income of 157 million  partially offset by a net decrease in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 684 million  the decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements with accounts receivable up 1089 million  inventories up 1444 million  and inventory deposits included in prepaid expenses and other assets up 631 million  these increases reflect substantial growth in the business and the expansion of our manufacturing and supply chain activities at our new contract manufacturer these working capital increases were partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of 1761 million  reflecting ongoing growth in service and support contracts and a significant increase in product deferred revenue related to contract acceptance terms other significant changes in operating assets and liabilities largely related to the overall growth of the business including an increase in accounts payable of 387 million  an increase in income taxes payable of 427 million  an increase in accrued liabilities of 306 million  offset by further increases in prepaid expenses and current assets of 548 million which was primarily driven by an increase in deferred cost of inventory associated with the increased product revenue deferrals referenced above 

during the year ended december 31 2015 cash provided by operating activities was 2005 million  primarily from net income of 1211 million net noncash charges of 12 million and a net increase in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 806 million the net increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of 903 million largely related to short and longterm services contracts and product revenue deferrals related to contracts with acceptance terms in addition we experienced an increase in cash of 320 million from income taxes payable and an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 294 million due to the timing of payments these operating liability increases were offset by an increase in our accounts receivable of 473 million resulting from an increase in sales during the period in addition inventory increased 141 million during the period due to higher shipment volume and prepaid expenses and current assets increased 78 million in the period 

during the year ended december 31 2014  cash provided by operating activities was 1319 million  primarily from net income of 869 million  net noncash charges of 110 million and an increase of 332 million  due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities the increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due an increase in deferred revenue of 476 million  resulting from the increase in sales an increase in accrued liabilities of 189 million  largely related to our payroll and corporate bonus plan and an increase in accounts payable of 140 million  due to the timing of our payments partially offset by a reduction in cash from an increase in accounts receivable of 190 million  from higher products shipments an increase in inventories of 134 million  to meet our customer demand an increase of 153 million  in cash paid for income taxes and supplier rebates receivable resulting from our increased inventory purchases 

cash flows from investing activities 

our investing activities have consisted primarily of capital expenditures and net investment purchases of available for sale marketable securities we expect to continue investing in these activities to support the continued growth of our business 

during the year ended december 31 2016 cash used in investing activities was 3260 million  consisting of purchases of availableforsale securities of 4397 million  purchases of property equipment and other assets of 214 million  and an additional investment in a privately held company of 25 million    cash used was offset by cash provided by proceeds from the maturity of availableforsale securities of 1379 million  

during the year ended december 31 2015 cash provided by investing activities was 1842 million  consisting of proceeds from the maturity of availableforsale securities of 2082 million offset by purchases of property equipment and other assets of 192 million and increase in restricted cash of 40 million related to a security deposit required for a facility lease 

during the year ended december 31 2014 cash used in investing activities was 2494 million  consisting primarily of purchases of marketable securities of 2100 million  purchases of property and equipment of 131 million  and other investing activities of 382 million  largely due to a 336 million equity investments in privately held companies partially offset by the proceeds of the repayments of our notes receivable of 80 million  and the release of our restricted cash into cash and cash equivalents of 40 million  

cash flows from financing activities 

during the year ended december 31 2016 cash provided by financing activities was 756 million  consisting primarily of the excess tax benefit associated with equity incentive plans of 429 million  proceeds from the exercise of stock options net of repurchases of 249 million  and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our espp of 103 million  

during the year ended december 31 2015 cash provided by financing activities was 631 million  consisting primarily of the excess tax benefit associated with equity incentive plans of 373 million proceeds from the exercise of stock options net of repurchases of 178 million and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our espp of 94 million 

during the year ended december 31 2014  cash provided by financing activities was 2440 million  consisting primarily of net proceeds raised from our initial public offering of 2393 million  proceeds from the exercise of stock options net of repurchases of 80 million  and excess tax benefits from our equity incentive plans amounting to 174 million  these proceeds were partially offset by the repayment of our notes payable of 200 million  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2016  we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

contractual obligations and commitments   

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity our contractual obligations represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations with terms in excess of one year we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing cash balances 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2016  in thousands 

 

1 includes interest and land lease 

the contractual obligation table above excludes tax liabilities of 161 million related to uncertain tax positions because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement if any of these future payments 

critical accounting policies and estimates   

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods we base our estimates assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements which in turn could change the results from those reported we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis the critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are the following 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from sales of our products which incorporate our eos software and accessories such as cables and optics to direct customers and channel partners together with post contract customer support “pcs” we typically sell products and pcs in a single transaction we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery or performance has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

we define each of the four criteria above as follows 

 pcs is offered under renewable feebased contracts which includes technical support hardware repair and replacement parts beyond standard warranty bug fixes patches and unspecified upgrades on a whenandifavailable basis we initially defer pcs revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the pcs contract with the related expenses recognized as incurred pcs contracts usually have a term of one  to three  years we include billed but unearned pcs revenue in deferred revenue 

we report revenue net of sales taxes we include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold 

multipleelement arrangements 

most of our arrangements other than renewals of pcs are multiple element arrangements with a combination of products and pcs products and pcs generally qualify as separate units of accounting our hardware deliverables include eos software which together deliver the essential functionality of our products for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price the relative selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy vendorspecific objective evidence “vsoe” if available thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe is not available and best estimate of selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available as we have not been able to establish vsoe or tpe for our products and most of our services we generally utilize besp for the purposes of allocating revenue to each unit of accounting 

   



 we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services future performance obligations or subject to customerspecific return acceptance or refund privileges 

we account for multiple agreements with a single partner as 1  arrangement if the contractual terms andor substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are in effect parts of a single arrangement 

we may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is no contractual provision for such returns we estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied against currentperiod gross revenues specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201409 “revenue from contracts with customers” which replaces current revenue recognition guidance asu 201409 requires revenue to be recognized when a customer obtains control of the promised goods or services the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the final consideration received in exchange for the goods and services 

management’s assessments of the potential impacts of the standard is underway the standard is expected to impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized and the related disclosures on our consolidated financial statements 

we will adopt asu 201409 during the first quarter of 2018 and we expect to adopt this new standard using the modified retrospective method that will result in a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption 

inventory valuation and contract manufacturersupplier liabilities 

inventories primarily consist of finished goods purchased from third party contract manufacturers and are stated at the lower of cost computed using the firstin firstout method or market value manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory in addition we purchase strategic component inventory from certain suppliers under purchase commitments that in some cases are noncancelable including integrated circuits which are held by our contract manufacturers we record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value we also record a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our component inventory suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete 

our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts we generally incur a liability when the contract manufacturer has converted the component inventory to a finished product historically we have reimbursed our contract manufacturer for component inventory that has been rendered excess or obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes or in cases where inventory levels greatly exceed our forecasts 

we use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures these estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers product development plans and current sales levels if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities 

warranty 

we offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90 day warranty against defects in the software embedded in the products we use judgment and estimates when determining warranty costs based on historical costs to replace product returns within the warranty period at the time we recognize revenue we accrue for potential warranty claims at the time of shipment as a component of cost of revenues based on historical experience and other relevant information we reserve for specifically identified products if and when we determine we have a systemic product failure although we engage in extensive product quality programs if actual product failure rates or use of materials differ from estimates additional warranty costs may be incurred which could reduce our gross margin the accrued warranty liability is recorded in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

stockbased compensation 

compensation expense related to stockbased transactions including stock options restricted stock units rsus restricted stock awards “rsas” and stock purchase rights under our employee stock purchase program is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity granted stockbased compensation expense is generally recognized on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service periods of the awards which typically ranges from two  to five  years the assumptions used in our optionpricing model represent management’s best estimates these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and different assumptions are used our stockbased 

compensation expense could be materially different in the future these assumptions and estimates are as follows 

fair value 

the fair value of stock options are estimated on the grant date using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model this model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the expected term of the option and the expected volatility of the price of our common stock 

expected term 

the expected term represents the period that our equity grants are expected to be outstanding for option grants that are considered to be “simple” we used the simplified method to determine the expected term which calculates the expected term as the average of the timetovesting and the contractual life of the options for option grants that are not considered “simple” the expected term is based on historical option exercise behavior and postvesting cancellations of options by employees for espp grants the expected term is based on the length of the each purchase period with an offering period 

expected volatility 

our volatility has historically been derived from the average historical stock volatilities of a peer group of public companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stockbased grants in late 2016 as sufficient but limited historical information became available we transitioned our expected volatility model to include a combination of our peer group and the limited historical and implied volatility of our common stock 

in addition to the assumptions used above we have through fiscal 2016 applied an estimated forfeiture rate to calculate the stockbased compensation expense for our equity awards our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures we account for forfeitures as they occur and calculate a cumulative adjustment as it relates to equity transactions where prior forfeitures rates have previously and cumulatively been applied 

income taxes 

income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that we recognize for financial reporting and income tax purposes 

we account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements but have not been reflected in our taxable income estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize 

we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

we regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether and to the extent to which additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense 

loss contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are a party to claims and legal proceedings including matters relating to commercial employee relations business practices and intellectual property in assessing loss contingencies we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss we record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we will record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and investments in privately held companies 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located which is primarily in the us and to a lesser extent in europe and asia our results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates the effect of an immediate 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at december 31 2016 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations to date foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

interest rate sensitivity 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and availableforsale marketable securities our cash and cash equivalents are held in cash deposits money market funds with maturities of less than 90 days from the date of purchase our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the us however because of the conservative and shortterm nature of the instruments in our portfolio a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 2999 million  invested in availableforsale marketable securities the effect of an immediate 10 change in interest rates at december 31 2016 would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows as of december 31 2016 we did not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

investments in privately held companies 

our nonmarketable equity investments in privately held companies are recorded in investments noncurrent in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using the cost method as of december 31 2016 the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was 361 million  

some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

management with the participation of our chief executive officer ceo and our chief financial officer cfo evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2016  the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2016  our ceo and cfo concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable 

assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting   

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by rule 13a15d and 15d15d of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended that occurred during the year ended december 31 2016  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of internal controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due   to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the securities exchange act of 1934 our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles

industry background 

cloud computing is fundamentally changing the way it infrastructure is built and how applications are delivered in cloud computing applications are distributed across thousands of servers these servers are connected with highspeed network switches that together form a pool of resources that allows applications to be rapidly deployed and costeffectively updated cloud computing enables ubiquitous and ondemand network access to these applications from internetconnected devices including personal computers tablets and smartphones 

nearly all consumer applications today are delivered as cloud services enterprise applications are rapidly moving to the cloud as well since cloud services are easier and more cost effective to deploy scale and operate than traditional applications internet leaders like amazon ebay facebook google microsoft and yahoo pioneered the development of largescale cloud data centers in order to meet the growing demands of their users including business customers enterprises and service providers around the world are adopting cloud computing technologies in order to achieve similar performance improvements and cost reductions 

the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can be orders of magnitude higher than typical legacy data center networks therefore the networks in such cloud environments must be architected and built in a new way we refer to these nextgeneration data center networks as cloud networks cloud networks must deliver high capacity high availability and predictable performance and must be programmable to allow integration with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services 

limitations of traditional data center networks 

in our view cloud networks and legacy networks are fundamentally different in a traditional data center specific applications are installed on a small number of servers and most network traffic is servertoclient or “northsouth” traffic which results in perhaps a few terabitssecond of aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud most network traffic is servertoserver or “eastwest” traffic the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can exceed 1 petabitsecond orders of magnitude higher than that of typical legacy data center networks 

the much larger scale of cloud networks requires much higher network availability since network outages in the cloud are very expensive in terms of customer impact traditional network switches have evolved and the features and capabilities of their operating system have expanded over many years without addressing the structural deficiencies of their underlying software architectures making it difficult to achieve high network switch reliability 

some networking vendors have built products that use proprietary protocols to address the scaling needs of nextgeneration data centers however proprietary protocols are generally not acceptable to internet companies or cloud service providers because they create vendor lockin 

legacy networks are not programmable and as a result are extremely difficult to integrate with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services this lack of integration forces customers to continue to rely on time consuming errorprone manual processes that may be costprohibitive 

requirements for cloud networking 

cloud networks differ in many aspects from legacy networks including capacity performance scale availability programmability automation visibility security and cost performance the requirements for cloud networking include the following

 our cloud networking solutions 

we are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration enterprise data centers our cloud networking platform was purposebuilt to address the functional and performance requirements for cloud networks we deliver our solutions via our industryleading 10254050100 gigabit ethernet switches optimized for nextgeneration data center networks 

our cloud networking solutions consist of eos our extensible operating system a set of networking applications and our 10254050100 gigabit ethernet switches at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was architected to be fully programmable and highly modular 

the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications and application programming interfaces or apis that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has further allowed us to integrate rapidly with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services 

the key benefits of our cloud networking solutions are as follows 

capacity performance and scalability 

our cloud networking platform enables data center networks to scale to hundreds of thousands of physical servers and millions of virtual machines with the least number of switching tiers we achieve this by leveraging standard protocols to meet the scale requirements of cloud computing we have used activeactive layer 2 and layer 3 network topologies to enable customers to build extremely large and resilient networks 

high availability 

our highly modular eos software architecture was designed to be faultisolating and selfhealing in order to deliver higher stability compared to legacy network operating systems in addition our customers can nondisruptively upgrade our switches running in the network using our smart system upgrade or ssu application 

open and programmable 

our eos software was purposebuilt to offer programmable interfaces throughout all levels of our software this has allowed us to integrate our cloud networking platform with a wide range of leading thirdparty applications for example we support vmware nsx openstack and microsoft system center for orchestration and fast provisioning enabling true workload mobility and automatic provisioning of physical switches we enable customers through application programming interfaces to write their own scripts to customize and optimize their networks in addition we support a wide range of softwaredefined network controllers via our openflow and directflow interfaces 

workflow automation 

our eos software enables enterprises to provision networking resources in minutes with no manual intervention through our zero touch provisioning we also natively support ansible cfengine chef puppet virtual network orchestration applications and thirdparty management tools cloudvision a networkwide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation delivering a turnkey solution for cloud networking cloudvision extends the same eos architectural approach across the network for state topology monitoring and visibility this enables enterprises to move to cloudclass automation without needing significant internal development finally eos embraces the devops model which is a software development method that combines development and operations to provision and monitor servers storage and network resources in a unified fashion 

network visibility 

our eos software provides a set of tools and applications that proactively monitor detect and notify network managers when network issues arise delivering realtime data to thirdparty management applications including corvil extrahop riverbed and splunk to provide detailed application visibility our telemetry applications include vm tracer which provides visibility down to the virtual machine level path tracer which detects errors in provisioned network paths mapreduce tracer which monitors and optimizes the performance of hadoop workloads and health tracer which monitors infrastructure resiliency our network visibility applications provide realtime insight into the status of the network they include lanz which monitors latency and danz which provides advanced traffic monitoring with flow analysis and timestamps plus the ability to perform tap aggregation for reporting and analysis 

security 

macrosegmentation services mss™ is one of the services enabled via arista cloudvision since cloudvision maintains a networkwide database of all state within the network as well as direct integration with hypervisor resources like vmware vsphere and nsx it is aware of where every workload is within the network and it learns in real time about new devices or workloads that are added to the network removed from the network or moved across ports or servers macrosegmentation extends the concept of finegrained interhypervisor security to cloud networks by enabling dynamic security and services of physical to virtual workloads macrosegmentation security is a complement to finegrained security delivered via microsegmentation that is implemented in the virtual switch of the physical host on which a vm is running 

lower total cost of ownership 

our cloud networking platform offers architectural and system advantages that provide our customers with costeffective and highly available cloud networking solutions our programmable scalable leafspine architectures combined with industryleading applications significantly reduce networking costs when compared to legacy network designs enabling faster time to service and improved availability our automation tools reduce the operational costs of provisioning managing and monitoring a data center network and speed up service delivery our visibility tools provide high levels of visibility into complex network environments without the need for additional data collection equipment as a result fewer network engineers are needed to operate large networks 

our market opportunity 

we compete primarily in the data center switching market for 10 gigabit ethernet and above excluding blade switches 

we believe that cloud computing represents a fundamental shift from traditional legacy data centers and that cloud networking is the fastest growing segment within the data center switching market as organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud architectures spending on cloud and nextgeneration data centers has increased rapidly over the last several years while traditional legacy it spending has been growing more slowly 

our customers 

as of december 31 2015 we had delivered our cloud networking solutions to approximately 3700 end customers worldwide in over 70 countries our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others for each of the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 microsoft purchases through our channel partner world wide technology inc accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue 

our competitive strengths 

we believe the following strengths will allow us to maintain and extend our technology leadership position in cloud networking and nextgeneration data center ethernet switching 

 8 

microsystems and from 1996 to 2003 served as vpgm of the gigabit systems business unit at cisco kenneth duda our founder chief technology officer and svp software engineering led the software development effort of the gigabit systems business unit at cisco from 1996 to 2000 

 our growth strategy 

we intend to grow our revenue and market share in cloud and nextgeneration data center ethernet switching key elements of our growth strategy include 

 our products and technology 

we offer one of the broadest product lines of data center 10254050100 gigabit ethernet switches in the industry comprising our 7050x series 7060x series 7150 series 7260 series 7280 leaf switches 7300x series spline switches and our 7500e series spine switches 

we deliver switches with industryleading capacity low latency port density and power efficiency we have also innovated in areas such as deep packet buffers embedded optics and reversible cooling our products have been recognized with a number of awards including the best of interop grand prize that was given to our industryleading spine switch the arista 7500 series in 2010 and again to the arista 7500e series in 2013 an overview of our switching portfolio is shown in the figure below 

we use multiple silicon architectures across our products which allows us to build a broader range of switching products optimized for different functions in the network than competitors that utilize fewer silicon architectures while we use multiple silicon architectures all of our switches are powered with the same binary eos image which significantly simplifies deployment and ensures the same rich feature set and consistent operation across all our products 

our extensible operating system 

the core of our cloud networking platform is our extensible operating system or eos which runs on top of standard linux and offers programmability at all layers of the stack all of our 10254050100 gigabit ethernet switches run our eos software 

eos is based on a new and innovative architecture that cleanly separates protocol processing from system state our eos software is highly modular and consists of more than 100 separate processes that we call agents each one handling specific protocol processing device driver or system management functions each agent runs in user space as a separate linux process and is completely protected and isolated from all other agents communication between agents only occurs through a central inmemory database called sysdb which provides a central repository for all system state any update posted by an agent to sysdb is automatically forwarded to all other processes that need to be notified of such an update to perform the appropriate processing the exchange of state through a central state repository is far more reliable than the conventional approach of direct interprocess communication between a large number of processes 

as illustrated below all agents are isolated from each other and interact directly through sysdb thereby ensuring fault containment and availability 

eos attributes 

the modular and programmable architecture of eos enables us to offer a set of attributes capabilities and features that are essential for cloud networking and nextgeneration data centers 

high availability 

eos is selfhealing in the sense that individual processes can be restarted without impacting application traffic the same attribute allows inservice software upgrades of individual eos processes the capability to recover from software faults and upgrade processes in a running system is not available in legacy network operating systems 

programmable at all layers 

eos is programmable at all layers from the linux kernel to switch configuration provisioning automation and detailed monitoring of the network 

complete network visibility 

through eos we have developed a wide range of applications available to our customers for purchase as additional licenses that enable enhanced network monitoring and visibility without requiring additional external monitoring devices 

network automation 

eos supports puppet chef and ansible which enables automatic network configuration in the same manner as servers and storage in addition eos provides tools that greatly reduce network operational costs 

cloudvision 

cloudvision’s abstraction of the physical network to this broader networkwide perspective allows for a more efficient approach for several operational usecases including the following highlights 

 leafspine network designs 

our customers typically deploy leafspine network topologies consisting of leaf switches or topofrack switches located in the server rack connected with uplinks to multiple loadsharing spine switches that provide the backbone our leafspine network designs scale up to more than 300000 physical servers and millions of virtual machines using equal cost multiple path or ecmp to load balance layer 3 network traffic across multiple spine switches with multichassis link aggregation or mlag we can build an activeactive layer 2 network that can connect more than 25000 physical servers examples of our leafspine mlag and ecmp architectures are illustrated below 

our leafspine network designs have been widely deployed and provide predictable network bandwidth and latency a key advantage of predictable network performance is that it eliminates the need to optimize the network for specific applications which means a single network design works equally well for all applications 

customer support and services 

we have designed our customer support offerings to provide our customers with high levels of support our global team of support engineers engages directly with client it teams and is available at all times over email by phone or through our website 

we offer multiple service options that allow our customers to select the product replacement service level that best meets their needs we stock spare parts in over 100 locations around the world through our thirdparty logistics suppliers all of our service options include unlimited access to bugfixes new featurereleases online case management and our community forums

we market and sell our products through our direct sales force and in partnership with our channel partners including distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators and oem partners we also sell in conjunction with various technology partners to facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity we have created a partner program the arista partner program to engage partners who provide valueadded services and extend our reach into the marketplace authorized training partners perform technical training of our channel partners and end customers our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us 

our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for presales technical support and solutions engineering for our end customers systems integrators original equipment manufacturers or oems and channel partners a pool of shared channel sales and marketing representatives also supports these teams each sales team is responsible for a geographical territory has responsibility for a number of major direct endcustomer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market we have field sales teams operating in over 70 countries during 2015 and 2014 773 and 797 of our revenue was generated from the americas substantially all from the us 153 and 128 from europe the middle east and africa and 74 and 75 from the asiapacific region respectively 

our marketing activities consist primarily of technology conferences web marketing trade shows product demonstrations seminars and events public relations analyst relations demand generation and direct marketing to build our brand increase endcustomer awareness communicate our product advantages and generate qualified leads for our field sales force and channel partners 

research and development 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and features that address the needs of our end customers our inhouse engineering personnel are responsible for the development quality documentation support and release of our products we plan to continue to invest significantly in resources to conduct our research and development efforts 

manufacturing 

we subcontract the manufacturing of all of our products to various contract manufacturers our primary manufacturing partners are jabil circuit and foxconn we also work with flextronics international ltd to provide logistics and final configuration services in north america this approach allows us to reduce our costs manufacturing overhead and inventory position and allows us to adjust more quickly to changing endcustomer demand we require all of our manufacturing locations to be iso9001 certified our eos software is installed on our products at one of three direct fulfillment facilities 

our contract manufacturing partners procure the majority of the components needed to build our products and assemble our products according to our design specifications this allows us to leverage the purchasing power of our contract manufacturing partners we retain complete control over the bill of material test procedures and quality assurance programs our onsite personnel work closely with our partners and review on an ongoing basis forecasts inventory levels processes capacity yields and overall quality our contract manufacturing partners procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts these forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analyses from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions we update these forecasts monthly 

our products rely on key components including merchant silicon integrated circuit components and power supplies purchased from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers generally neither our contract manufacturers nor we have a written agreement with any of these component providers to guarantee the supply of the key components used in our products nor do we have exclusive rights to such key components our product development efforts also depend upon continued collaboration with our key suppliers including our merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors it is critical that we work in tandem with our key merchant silicon vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features this enables us to focus our research and development resources on software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions 

once the completed products are manufactured and tested our contract manufacturing partners ship them to various theatre direct fulfillment facilities in california the netherlands and singapore for final configuration quality control inspection and shipment to our distribution partners and end customers after the products are shipped to our end customers our products are installed by the end customers or by thirdparty service providers such as system integrators or value added resellers on their behalf 

backlog 

we do not have any longterm purchase commitments from customers customers generally order products on an asneeded basis with short lead and delivery times on a perpurchaseorder basis we maintain substantial finished goods inventory to ensure that products can generally be shipped shortly after receipt of an order a significant portion of our customer shipments in any fiscal year relate to orders received and shipped in that fiscal year resulting in low product backlog relative to total shipments because our customers utilize purchase orders containing nonbinding purchase commitments and we allow customers to cancel change or reschedule orders without penalty at any time prior to shipment we also do not believe backlog is firm as a result of the foregoing factors backlog is not material and not a meaningful indicator in any given period of our ability to achieve any particular level of overall revenue or financial performance 

competition 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology changing endcustomer needs evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services we expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for cloud networking expands and existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products 

the data center networking market has been historically dominated by cisco systems with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including brocade communications systems dell hewlettpackard and juniper networks we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants including “whitebox” switch vendors as well as current technology partners and end customers who may develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products 

the principle competitive factors applicable to our products include 

 we believe our products compete favorably with respect to these factors our eos software offers high reliability integrates with existing network protocols and is open and programmable we believe the combination of eos a set of network applications and our 10254050100 gigabit ethernet switch makes our offering highly competitive for both cloud and enterprise data centers however many of our competitors have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger sales and marketing budgets and resources broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and end customers greater access to larger endcustomer bases greater endcustomer support resources greater manufacturing resources the ability to leverage their sales efforts across a broader portfolio of products the ability to leverage purchasing power when purchasing subcomponents the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services the ability to develop their own silicon chips the ability to set more aggressive pricing policies lower labor and development costs greater resources to make acquisitions larger intellectual property portfolios and substantially greater financial technical research and development or other resources 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our core technology and intellectual property we rely on patent trademark and copyright laws trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees end customers resellers systems integrators and others to protect our intellectual property rights as of december 31 2015 we had 63 us patent applications12 foreign patent applications and 5 us patents which have expiration dates between 2028 and 2035 

we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of valuable breadth or applicability in addition any patents that may be issued may be contested circumvented 

found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them we also license software from third parties for integration into our products including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms we also own a number of trademarks in the us and other jurisdictions including arista which mark is not registered in the us eos cloudvision health tracer mapreduce tracer path tracer mxp rail and spline 

we control access to and use of our software technology and other proprietary information through internal and external controls including contractual protections with employees contractors end customers and partners our software is protected by us and international copyright patent and trade secret laws despite our efforts to protect our software technology and other proprietary information unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software technology and other proprietary information in addition we intend to expand our international operations and effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights if we become more successful we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights it may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights in particular large and established companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation from time to time third parties including certain of these large companies and nonpracticing entities may assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our end customers whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against such claims for example in december 2014 cisco systems filed two lawsuits against us in the northern district of california for alleged patent and copyright infringement additionally cisco systems filed to complaints against us in the international trade commission itc for patent infringement and the itc has initiated an investigation please see legal proceedings included in part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of this litigation successful claims of infringement by a third party if any could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services require us to expend time and money to develop noninfringing solutions or force us to pay substantial damages royalties or other fees we cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe or that we will not in the future infringe upon any thirdparty patents or other proprietary rights 

employees 

as of december 31 2015  we employed over 1200 fulltime employees none of our employees are represented by unions we consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced significant interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k which could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the risks described below are not the only risks facing us risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

risks related to our business and our industry 

our business and operations have experienced rapid growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected 

we have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last several years which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure our employee headcount and number of end customers have increased significantly to handle the increase in end customers we expect to continue to grow our headcount significantly over the next 12 months for example as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2015  our cumulative number of end customers increased from approximately 1100 to over 3700 as we have grown we have had to manage an increasingly larger and more complex array of internal systems and processes to scale with all aspects of our business including our hardware and software development contract manufacturing and purchasing logistics and fulfillment and maintenance and support our success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and continue to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems we may not be able to successfully implement these or other improvements to our systems and processes in an efficient or timely manner and we may discover deficiencies in their capabilities or effectiveness we may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems and processes or in connection with thirdparty technology in addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate effectively and in the intended manner may result in disruption of our current operations and endcustomer relationships our inability to manage the growth of our business and our inability to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings and prevent certain losses 

our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and may increase the risk associated with your investment 

we were founded in 2004 and shipped our first products in 2008 the majority of our revenue growth has occurred since the beginning of 2010 our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects including our ability to plan for and model future growth we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries including the risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k if we do not address these risks successfully our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline further we have limited historical financial data and we operate in a rapidly evolving market as such any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market 

our results of operations are likely to vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors or our previously issued financial guidance or if any forwardlooking financial guidance does not meet the expectation of analysts or investors the market price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our results of operations have historically varied from period to period and we expect that this trend will continue as a result you should not rely upon our past financial results for any period as indicators of future performance our results of operations in any given period can be influenced by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict including 

 15 

 any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of several of the factors described above may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other results of operations this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our revenue gross margins results of operations or other expectations contained in any forward looking financial guidance we have issued or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for a particular period if we fail to meet or exceed such guidance or expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our common stock could decline substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits 

we expect large purchases by a limited number of end customers to continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue and any loss or delay of expected purchases could result in material quartertoquarter fluctuations of our revenue or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue many of these end customers make large purchases to complete or upgrade specific data center installations and are typically made on a purchaseorder basis rather than pursuant to longterm contracts revenue from sales to microsoft through our channel partner world wide technology inc accounted for 120 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2015 149 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 and 219 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 

as a consequence of the concentrated nature of our customer base and their purchasing behavior our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate for example any cancellation of orders or any acceleration or delay in anticipated product purchases or the acceptance of shipped products by our larger end customers could materially affect our revenue and results of operations in any quarterly period we may be unable to sustain or increase our revenue from our large end customers or offset the discontinuation of concentrated purchases by our larger end customers with purchases by new or existing end customers we expect that such concentrated purchases will continue to contribute materially to our revenue for the foreseeable future and that our results of operations may fluctuate materially as a result of such larger end customers’ buying patterns in addition we may see consolidation of our customer base such as among internet companies and cloud service providers which could result in loss of end customers the loss of such end customers or a significant delay or reduction in their purchases could materially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance 

our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance we experienced annual revenue growth rates of 434 617 and 868 in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we may not achieve similar revenue growth rates in future periods especially as we enter and expand into the cloud services and application services provider markets you should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual period as any indication of our future revenue or revenue growth if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

we face intense competition especially from larger wellestablished companies and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

the market for data center networking including the market for cloud networking is intensely competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants this competition could result in increased pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and our failure to increase or the loss of market share any of which would likely seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the data center networking market has been historically dominated by cisco systems with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including juniper networks brocade communications systems hewlettpackard and dell we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants including “whitebox” switch vendors as well as current technology partners and end customers many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

 our competitors also may be able to provide end customers with capabilities or benefits different from or greater than those we can provide in areas such as technical qualifications or geographic presence or may be able to provide end customers a broader range of products services and prices in addition large competitors may have more extensive relationships with and within existing and potential end customers that provide them with an advantage in competing for business with those end customers for example certain large competitors encourage end customers of their other products and services to adopt their data networking solutions through discounted bundled product packages our ability to compete will depend upon our ability to provide a better solution than our competitors at a more competitive price we may be required to make substantial additional investments in research development marketing and sales in order to respond to competition and we cannot assure you that these investments will achieve any returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

we also expect increased competition if our market continues to expand conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or other factors current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties that have greater resources available than we do our current or potential competitors might take advantage of the greater resources of the larger organization resulting from these acquisitions to compete more vigorously or broadly with us in addition continued industry consolidation might adversely affect end customers’ perceptions of the viability of smaller and even mediumsized networking companies and consequently end customers’ willingness to purchase from those companies further certain large end customers may develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products which could allow these end customers to become new competitors in the market 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

the cloud networking market can be characterized by rapid technological shifts and increasingly complex endcustomer requirements to achieve scalable and more programmable networks that facilitate virtualization big data publicprivate cloud and web scale computing we must continue to develop new technologies and products that address emerging technological trends and changing endcustomer needs the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and new offerings requires significant upfront investment that may not result in material design improvements to existing products or result in marketable new products or costs savings or revenue for an extended period of time if at all the success of new products depends on several factors including appropriate new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 

in addition new technologies could render our existing products obsolete or less attractive to end customers and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if such technologies are widely adopted for example end customers may prefer to address their network switch requirements by licensing software operating systems separately and placing them on industrystandard servers or develop their own networking products rather than purchasing integrated hardware products as has occurred in the server industry 

we may not be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology or endcustomer requirements on a timely basis or at all if we fail to keep up with technology changes or to convince our end customers and potential end customers of the value of our solutions even in light of new technologies our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

we are currently involved in litigation with cisco systems inc 

on december 5 2014 cisco filed two complaints against us in district court for the northern district of california which are proceeding as case no 414cv05343 “’43 case” and case no 514cv05344 “’44 case” in the ’43 case cisco alleges that we infringe us patent nos 6377577 6741592 7023853 7061875 7162537 7200145 7224668 7290164 7340597 7460492 8051211 and 8356296 respectively “the ’577 patent” “the ’592 patent” “the ’853 patent” “the 875 patent” “the ’537 patent” “the ’145 patent” “the ’668 patent” “the ’164 patent” “the ’597 patent” “the ’492 patent” “the ’211 patent” and “the ’296 patent” cisco seeks as relief for our alleged infringement in the ’43 case lost profits andor reasonable royalty damages in an unspecified amount including treble damages attorney’s fees and associated costs cisco also seeks injunctive relief in the ’43 case on february 10 2015 the court granted our unopposed motion to stay the ’43 case until the proceedings before the united states international trade commission “usitc” pertaining to the same patents as discussed below become final in the ’44 case cisco’s complaint alleges that we infringe us patent nos 7047526 and 7953886 respectively “the ’526 patent” and “the ’886 patent” and further alleges that we infringe numerous copyrights pertaining to cisco’s “command line interface” or “cli” as relief for our alleged patent infringement in the ’44 case cisco seeks lost profits andor reasonable royalty damages in an unspecified amount including treble damages attorney’s fees and associated costs as well as injunctive relief as relief for our alleged copyright infringement cisco seeks damages in an unspecified amount in the form of alleged lost profits profits from our alleged infringement statutory damages attorney’s fees and associated costs cisco also seeks injunctive relief against our alleged copyright infringement on february 13 2015 we answered the complaint in the ’44 case denying the patent and copyright infringement allegations and also raising numerous affirmative defenses on march 6 2015 cisco filed an amended complaint against us the ’44 case in response we moved to dismiss cisco’s allegations of willful patent infringement presuit indirect patent infringement the court granted the motion with leave to amend on july 2 2015 on july 23 2015 cisco filed an amended complaint on january 25 2016 we sought leave to file counterclaims against cisco in the ’44 case for antitrust and unfair competition trial has been set for november 21 2016 in the ’44 case trial has not been scheduled in the ’43 case 

on december 19 2014 cisco filed two complaints against us in the usitc alleging that arista has violated section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 as amended the complaints have been instituted as itc inv nos 337ta944 “944 investigation” and 337ta945 “945 investigation” in the 944 investigation cisco initially alleged that certain arista switching products infringe the ’592 ’537 ’145 ’164 ’597 and ’296 patents cisco has subsequently dropped the ’296 patent from the 944 investigation in the 945 investigation cisco alleges that certain arista switching products infringe the ’577 ’853 ’875 ’668 ’492 and ’211 patents in both the 944 and 945 investigations cisco seeks among other things a limited exclusion order barring entry into the united states of accused switch products including 7000 series of switches and a cease and desist order against us restricting our activities with respect to our imported accused switch products on february 11 2015 we responded to the notices of investigation and complaints in the 944 and 945 investigations by among other things denying the patent infringement allegations and raising numerous affirmative defenses 

the administrative law judge assigned to the 944 investigation issued a procedural schedule calling for among other events an evidentiary hearing on sept 911  1517 2015 issuance of an initial determination regarding our alleged violations on january 27 2016 and the target date for completion on may 27 2016 on january 27 2016 the administrative law judge issued a revised procedural schedule extending the date for issuance an initial determination to february 2 2016 and the target date to june 2 2016 the final determination in the 944 investigation is then subject to presidential review the hearing has been completed and all post trial briefs have 

been submitted to the usitc on february 2 2016 the administrative law judge issued his initial determination finding a violation of section 337 of the tariff act more specifically it was found that a violation has occurred in the importation into the united states the sale for importation or the sale within the united states after importation of certain network devices related software and components thereof that the alj found infringe asserted claims 1 2 811 and 1719 of the ‘537 patent asserted claims 6 7 20 and 21 of the ‘592 patent and asserted claims 5 7 45 and 46 of the ‘145 patent a violation of section 337 was not found with respect to any asserted claims of the ‘597 and ‘164 patents on february 17 2016 we filed a request for the commission to review certain issues including the infringement findings in the initial determination and the commission must decide whether to grant the review no later than 60 days from the date of the initial determination february 2 2016 

the administrative law judge assigned to the 945 investigation issued a procedural schedule calling for among other events an evidentiary hearing on november 920 2015 issuance of an initial determination regarding our alleged violations on april 26 2016 and the target date for completion on august 26 2016 the evidentiary hearing was conducted in november 2015 and all posthearing briefing has been completed we are awaiting the initial determination from the administrative law judge the initial determination will be subject to review by the commission which will then issue a final determination and any remedial orders on august 26 2016 if the final determination finds a violation it will be subject to presidential review 

on april 1 2015 we filed petitions for inter partes review with the united states patent trial and appeal board “ptab” seeking to invalidate cisco’s ’597 ’211 and ’668 patents on april 10 2015 we filed petitions for inter partes review with the ptab seeking to invalidate cisco’s ’853 and ’577 patents on april 16 2015 we filed additional petitions for inter partes review with the ptab seeking to invalidate cisco’s ’853 and ’577 patents on august 11 2015 we filed a second petition for inter partes review of cisco’s ’668 patent on october 6 2015 we filed a second petition for inter partes review of cisco’s ’211 patent on october 6 2015 the ptab granted our petition for inter partes review of cisco’s ’597 patent and our first petition for inter partes review of cisco’s ’211 patents but denied one of our petitions for inter partes review of cisco’s ’668 patent on october 19 2015 and october 22 2015 the ptab denied four petitions relating to the ‘853 and ‘577 patents on november 18 2015 we filed a request for rehearing on one of the denied petitions related to the ’577 patent and we are awaiting a decision on the request on december 9 2015 we filed a petition for inter partes review with the ptab seeking to invalidate cisco’s ’537 patent and additional petitions for inter partes review with the ptab seeking to invalidate cisco’s ’853 ’577 and ’668 patents on february 16 2016 the ptab denied our second petition for inter partes review of the ’668 patent we are awaiting decisions by the ptab on our remaining petitions for inter partes review of the ’537 ’853 ’577 and ’668 patents for those petitions that the ptab grants the ptab must issue its final written decision on validity within twelve months of its institution decision 

we intend to vigorously defend against cisco’s lawsuits as summarized in the preceding paragraphs whether or not we prevail in the lawsuit we expect that the litigation will be expensive timeconsuming and a distraction to management in operating our business moreover we cannot be certain that any claims by cisco would be resolved in our favor regardless of the merit of the claims for example an adverse litigation ruling could result in a significant damages award against us could further result in the above described injunctive relief could result in a requirement that we make substantial royalty payments to cisco andor could require that we modify our products to the extent that we are found to infringe any valid claims asserted against us cisco any such adverse ruling could materially adversely affect our business prospects results of operation and financial condition 

in particular with respect to the 944 and 945 investigations if our products are found to infringe any patents that are the subject of those investigations the usitc would likely issue a limited exclusion order barring entry into the united states of our products including 7000 series of switches and a cease and desist order restricting our activities with respect to our imported products if we become subject to a limited exclusion order and it is not disapproved by the us trade representative we will need to remove features or develop technical designarounds in order to take the products outside of the scope of any patent found to have been infringed and the subject of a violation we may not be successful in developing technical designarounds that do not infringe the patents or that are acceptable to our customers our development efforts could be extremely costly and time consuming as well as disruptive to our other development activities and distracting to management moreover we may seek to obtain clearance for any such technical designarounds from us customs and border patrol “cbp” in order to continue the importation of our products and we may be unable to do so in a timely manner if at all in the case that we attempt to change our manufacturing importation processes and shipping workflows to comply with any limited exclusion order or cease and desist order such changes may be extremely costly time consuming and we may not be able to implement such changes successfully any failure to develop effective technical designarounds obtain timely clearance of such technical designarounds or successfully change our manufacturing importation processes or shipping workflows may cause a disruption in our shipments and impact our revenues business and reputation 

in the event that the usitc issues a limited exclusion order and cease and desist order cisco may also seek to enforce any limited exclusion order or cease and desist order by filing for an enforcement action at the usitc in such a proceeding we would need to demonstrate that our technical designarounds render our products noninfringing or otherwise outside the scope of the limited exclusion order or cease and desist order if we are unable to do so then any product shipments after the effective date of the limited exclusion order or cease and desist order whether from existing imported inventory or from products assembled from foreign sourced components could be subject to significant civil penalties potential seizure of that inventory which was found to have an ineffective technical designaround and an injunction from importing further products until we implement additional technical designarounds 

additionally the existence of this lawsuit could cause concern among our customers and partners and could adversely affect our business and results of operations many of our customers and partners require us to indemnify and defend them against third party infringement claims and pay damages in the case of adverse rulings these claims could harm our relationships with our customers or channel partners and might deter them from doing business with us from time to time we may also be required to provide additional assurances beyond our standard terms whether or not we prevail in the lawsuit our satisfaction of these obligations may be expensive timeconsuming and a distraction to management in operating our business 

we are currently involved in a license dispute with optumsoft inc 

on april 4 2014 optumsoft filed a lawsuit against us in the superior court of california santa clara county titled optumsoft inc v arista networks inc in which it asserts i ownership of certain components of our eos network operating system pursuant to the terms of a 2004 agreement between the companies and ii breaches of certain confidentiality and use restrictions in that agreement under the terms of the 2004 agreement optumsoft provided us with a nonexclusive irrevocable royaltyfree license to software delivered by optumsoft comprising a software tool used to develop certain components of eos and a runtime library that is incorporated into eos the 2004 agreement places certain restrictions on our use and disclosure of the optumsoft software and gives optumsoft ownership of improvements modifications and corrections to and derivative works of the optumsoft software that we develop 

in its lawsuit optumsoft has asked the court to order us to i give optumsoft copies of certain components of our software for evaluation by optumsoft ii cease all conduct constituting the alleged confidentiality and use restriction breaches iii secure the return or deletion of optumsoft’s alleged intellectual property provided to third parties including our customers iv assign ownership to optumsoft of optumsoft’s alleged intellectual property currently owned by us and v pay optumsoft’s alleged damages attorney’s fees and costs of the lawsuit david cheriton one of our founders and a former member of our board of directors who resigned from our board of directors on march 1 2014 and has no continuing role with us is a founder and we believe the largest stockholder and director of optumsoft the 2010 david r cheriton irrevocable trust dtd july 27 2010 a trust for the benefit of the minor children of mr cheriton is one of our largest stockholders 

optumsoft has identified in confidential documents certain software components it claims to own which are generally applicable tools and utility subroutines and not networking specific code we cannot assure which software components optumsoft may ultimately claim to own in the litigation or whether such claimed components are material 

on april 14 2014 we filed a crosscomplaint against optumsoft in which we assert our ownership of the software components at issue and our interpretation of the 2004 agreement among other things we assert that the language of the 2004 agreement and the parties’ long course of conduct support our ownership of the disputed software components we asked the court to declare our ownership of those software components all similarlysituated software components developed in the future and all related intellectual property we also assert that even if we are found not to own any particular components at issue such components are licensed to us under the terms of the 2004 agreement however there can be no assurance that our assertions will ultimately prevail in litigation on the same day we also filed an answer to optumsoft’s claims as well as affirmative defenses based in part on optumsoft’s failure to maintain the confidentiality of its claimed trade secrets its authorization of the disclosures it asserts and its delay in claiming ownership of the software components at issue we have also taken additional steps to respond to optumsoft’s allegations that we improperly used andor disclosed optumsoft confidential information while we believe we have meritorious defenses to these allegations we believe we have i revised our software to remove the elements we understand to be the subject of the claims relating to improper use and disclosure of optumsoft confidential information and made the revised software available to our customers and ii removed information from our website that optumsoft asserted disclosed optumsoft confidential information 

the parties tried the case for phase i of the proceedings relating to contract interpretation and application of the contract to certain claimed source code in september 2015 on december 16 2015 the court issued a proposed statement of decision following phase 1 trial in that proposed statement the court agreed with and adopted our interpretation of the 2004 agreement and held that we and not optumsoft own all of the software that was put at issue in phase 1 on january 8 2016 optumsoft filed its objections to the court’s proposed statement of decision the court has not ruled on those objections to date and we anticipate a ruling in the first calendar quarter of 2016 the remaining issues that were not addressed in the phase i trial are currently scheduled to be tried in april 2016 

we intend to vigorously defend against optumsoft’s lawsuit however we cannot be certain that if litigated any claims by optumsoft would be resolved in our favor for example if it were determined that optumsoft owned components of our eos network operating system we would be required to transfer ownership of those components and any related intellectual property to optumsoft if optumsoft were the owner of those components it could make them available to our competitors such as through a sale or license in addition optumsoft could assert additional or different claims against us including claims that our license from optumsoft is invalid 

additionally the existence of this lawsuit could cause concern among our customers and potential customers and could adversely affect our business and results of operations an adverse litigation ruling could also result in a significant damages award against us and the injunctive relief described above in addition if our license was ruled to have been terminated and we were not able to negotiate a new license from optumsoft on reasonable terms we could be required to pay substantial royalties to optumsoft or be prohibited from selling products that incorporate optumsoft intellectual property any such adverse ruling could materially adversely 

affect our business prospects results of operation and financial condition whether or not we prevail in the lawsuit we expect that the litigation will be expensive timeconsuming and a distraction to management in operating our business 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

the cloud networking market can be characterized by rapid technological shifts and increasingly complex endcustomer requirements to achieve scalable and more programmable networks that facilitate virtualization big data publicprivate cloud and web scale computing we must continue to develop new technologies and products that address emerging technological trends and changing endcustomer needs the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and new offerings requires significant upfront investment that may not result in material design improvements to existing products or result in marketable new products or costs savings or revenue for an extended period of time if at all the success of new products depends on several factors including appropriate new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 

in addition new technologies could render our existing products obsolete or less attractive to end customers and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if such technologies are widely adopted for example end customers may prefer to address their network switch requirements by licensing software operating systems separately and placing them on industrystandard servers or develop their own networking products rather than purchasing integrated hardware products as has occurred in the server industry 

we may not be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology or endcustomer requirements on a timely basis or at all if we fail to keep up with technology changes or to convince our end customers and potential end customers of the value of our solutions even in light of new technologies our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

product quality problems defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate advanced technologies including both hardware and software technologies despite testing prior to their release our products may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in analyzing correcting or redesigning the products cause us to lose significant end customers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

from time to time we have had to replace certain components of products that we had shipped and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs including failures in software protocols or defective component batches resulting in reliability issues in such products and we may be required to do so in the future we may also be required to provide full replacements or refunds for such defective products we cannot assure you that such remediation would not have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects please see “—our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects” 

the cloud networking market is still in its early stages and is rapidly evolving if this market does not evolve as we anticipate or our target end customers do not adopt our cloud networking solutions we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

the cloud networking market is still in its early stages the market demand for cloud networking solutions has increased in recent years as end customers have deployed larger networks and have increased the use of virtualization and cloud computing our success depends upon our ability to provide cloud networking solutions that address the needs of end customers more effectively and economically than those of other competitors or existing technologies 

if the cloud networking solutions market does not develop in the way we anticipate if our solutions do not offer benefits compared to competing network switching products or if end customers do not recognize the benefits that our solutions provide then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act the listing requirements of the new york stock exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations including the sarbanesoxley act and the doddfrank act compliance with these rules and regulations and the attendant responsibilities of management and the board may make it more difficult to attract and retain executive officers and members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee has increased our legal and financial compliance costs made some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and increased demand on our systems and resources among other things the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to maintain and if required improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard significant resources and management oversight may be required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects although we have already hired additional employees to help comply with these requirements we may need to further expand our legal and finance departments in the future which will increase our costs and expenses 

we are also subject to the independent auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act “section 404” enhanced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved while we were able to determine in our managements report for fiscal 2015 that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as well as provide an unqualified attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm to that effect we have and will continue to consume management resources and incur significant expenses for section 404 compliance on an ongoing basis in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determines in the future that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 we could be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs pay fines settlements or judgments and causing investor perceptions to be adversely affected and potentially resulting in a decline in the market price of our stock 

in addition changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure such as continued rulemaking pursuant to the doddfrank act of 2010 and related rules and regulations regarding the disclosure of conflict minerals that are mandated by the doddfrank act are creating uncertainty for public companies increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming these laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if our efforts to comply with new laws regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business and prospects may be harmed as a result of disclosure of information in the filings required of a public company our business and financial condition will become more visible which may result in threatened or actual litigation including by competitors and other third parties if such claims are successful our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be harmed and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor these claims and the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert the resources of our management and harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in addition as a result of our disclosure obligations as a public company we will have reduced strategic flexibility and will be under pressure to focus on shortterm results which may adversely affect our ability to achieve longterm profitability 

if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 

assessing our processes procedures and staffing in order to improve our internal control over financial reporting is an ongoing process for the year ended december 31 2015 management became obligated to comply for the first time with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and has issued a report that assesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

also for the year ended december 31 2015 an attestation report concerning the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been issued for the first time by ernst  young llp independent registered public accounting firm 

preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes many of which are done manually and are dependent upon individual data input or review these processes include but are not limited to calculating revenue inventory costs and the preparation of our statement of cash flows while we continue to automate our processes and enhance our review controls to reduce the likelihood for errors we expect that for the foreseeable future many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error 

in the past we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we have remediated these identified material weaknesses but we cannot give assurance that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future in connection with our compliance with the provisions of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the existence of one or more material weaknesses could preclude a conclusion by management that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting the existence or disclosure of any such material weakness could adversely affect our stock price 

if we are unable to attract new large end customers or to sell additional products to our existing end customers our revenue growth will be adversely affected and our revenue could decrease 

to increase our revenue we must add new end customers and large end customers and sell additional products to existing end customers for example one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our solutions thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers we believe this opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing infrastructure and expected future spend if we fail to attract new large end customers or sell additional products to our existing end customers our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

some of our large end customers require more favorable terms and conditions from their vendors and may request price concessions as we seek to sell more products to these end customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenue 

our large end customers have significant purchasing power and as a result may receive more favorable terms and conditions than we typically provide to other end customers including lower prices bundled upgrades extended warranties acceptance terms indemnification terms and extended return policies and other contractual rights as we seek to sell more products to these large end customers an increased mix of our shipments may be subject to such terms and conditions which may reduce our margins or affect the timing of our revenue recognition and thus may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

as a result of endcustomer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the second half of each quarter this places significant pressure on order review and processing supply chain management manufacturing inventory and quality control management shipping and trade compliance to ensure that we have properly forecasted supply purchasing manufacturing capacity inventory and quality compliance and logistics if there is any significant interruption in these critical functions it could result in delayed order fulfillment adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

we base our inventory requirements on our forecasts of future sales if these forecasts are materially inaccurate we may procure inventory that we may be unable to use in a timely manner or at all 

we and our contract manufacturers procure components and build our products based on our forecasts these forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products which are in turn based on historical trends and analyses from our sales and marketing organizations adjusted for overall market conditions to the extent our forecasts are materially inaccurate or if we otherwise do not need such inventory we may under or overprocure inventory and such inaccuracies in our forecasts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

managing the supply of our products and product components is complex insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing the supply of our products and product components is complex and our inventory management systems and related supplychain visibility tools may not enable us to forecast accurately and manage effectively the supply of our products and product components furthermore ongoing cisco litigation before the ustic and any adverse ruling that results from such litigation could cause disruption to our supplychain or with our suppliers which may impact our revenues business and reputation 

insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply from time to time we may issue purchase orders for components and products that are noncancelable and nonreturnable we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our thirdparty contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or obsolete material charges 

supply management remains an increased area of focus as we balance the need to maintain sufficient supply levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of obsolescence or the end of life of certain products if we ultimately determine that we have excess supply we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins we record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value 

alternatively insufficient supply levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential end customers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available additionally any increases in the time required to manufacture our products or ship products could result in supply shortfalls if we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

because some of the key components in our products come from sole limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers and may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

our products rely on key components including integrated circuit components and power supplies that our contract manufacturers purchase on our behalf from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers we do not have guaranteed supply contracts with any of our component suppliers and our suppliers could delay shipments or cease manufacturing such products or selling them to us at any time for example in the past we have experienced shortages in inventory for dynamic random access memory integrated circuits and delayed releases of the next generation of chipset which delayed our production andor the release of our new products the development of alternate sources for those components is timeconsuming difficult and costly if we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner sales of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products any of these events could result in lost sales and damage to our endcustomer relationships which would adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our reliance on component suppliers also yields the potential for their infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property rights with respect to components which may be incorporated into our products we may not be indemnified by such component suppliers for such infringement or misappropriation claims any litigation for which we do not receive indemnification could require us to incur significant legal expenses in defending against such claims or require us to pay substantial royalty payments or settlement amounts that would not be reimbursed by our component suppliers 

our product development efforts are also dependent upon our continued collaboration with our key merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors it is critical that we work in tandem with our key merchant silicon vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features this enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions 

if our key merchant silicon vendors do not continue to collaborate in such a fashion if they do not continue to innovate or if there are delays in the release of their products our own product launches could be delayed which could have a material effect on revenue and business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in the event of a shortage or supply interruption from our component suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner further longterm supply and maintenance obligations to end customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in addition our component suppliers change their selling prices frequently in response to market trends including industrywide increases in demand and because we do not have contracts with these suppliers we are susceptible to price fluctuations related to raw materials and components if we are unable to pass component price increases along to our end customers or maintain stable pricing our gross margins could be adversely affected and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

because we depend on thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping endcustomer orders on time if at all or on a costeffective basis which may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

we depend on thirdparty contract manufacturers to manufacture our product lines a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to these thirdparty contract manufacturers our reliance on these thirdparty contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process quality assurance product costs and product supply and timing which exposes us to risk to the extent that our products are manufactured at facilities in foreign countries we may be subject to additional risks associated with complying with local rules and regulations in those jurisdictions if we fail to manage our relationships with our thirdparty manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in their operations this could severely impair our ability to fulfill orders on time if at all or on a costeffective basis 

our reliance on contract manufacturers also yields the potential for their infringement of third party intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of our products or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of other customers’ products if we are unable to manage our relationships with our thirdparty contract manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers suffer delays or disruptions for any reason experience increased manufacturing lead times capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our end customers would be severely impaired and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be seriously harmed 

our contract manufacturers typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual orders we do not have longterm contracts with our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular pricing terms or the extension of credit 

limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements which could result in supply shortages and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice for example a competitor could place large orders with the thirdparty manufacturer thereby utilizing all or substantially all of such thirdparty manufacturer’s capacity and leaving the manufacturer little or no capacity to fulfill our individual orders without price increases or delays or at all our contract with one of our contract manufacturers permits it to terminate the agreement for convenience subject to prior notice requirements we may not be able to develop alternate or second contract manufacturers in a timely manner 

if we add or change contract manufacturers or change any manufacturing plant locations within a contract manufacturer network we would add additional complexity and risk to our supply chain management ensuring a new contract manufacturer or new plant location is qualified to manufacture our products to our standards and industry requirements could take significant effort and be time consuming and expensive for example if we suffer an adverse ruling with respect to certain ongoing cisco litigation we are involved in before the ustic we may be required to add or change our manufacturers in order to comply with the ruling any such addition or change in manufacturers may be extremely costly time consuming and we may not be able to do so successfully 

in addition we may be subject to additional significant challenges in ensuring that quality processes and costs among other issues are consistent with our expectations and those of our customers a new contract manufacturer or manufacturing location may not be able to scale its production of our products at the volumes or quality we require this could also adversely affect our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers which could damage our customer relationships and cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end customers late delivery penalties delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins this could also result in increased levels of inventory subjecting us to increased excess and obsolete charges that could have a negative impact on our operating results 

any production interruptions or disruptions for any reason such as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages adverse results from intellectual property litigation or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would adversely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are unable to increase market awareness of our company and our products our revenue may not continue to grow or may decline 

we have not yet established broad market awareness of our products and services market awareness of our value proposition and products and services will be essential to our continued growth and our success particularly for the service provider and large enterprise markets if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful in creating market awareness of our company and our products and services then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth 

the sales prices of our products and services may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our results of operations 

the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts a change in our mix of products and services the introduction of new products and services by us or by our competitors promotional programs product and related warranty costs or broader macroeconomic factors in addition we have provided and may in the future provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers 

we have experienced declines in sales prices for our products including our 10 gigabit ethernet modular and fixed switches competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and services additionally although we generally price our products worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may adversely affect actual prices that partners and end customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the sales prices and gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles decreased sales prices for any reason may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our result of operations 

seasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations 

we operate on a december 31 year end and believe that there are significant seasonal factors which may cause sequential product revenue growth to be greater for the second and fourth quarters of our year than our first and third quarters we believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors including the procurement budgeting and deployment cycles of many of our end customers our rapid historical growth may have reduced the impact of seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date as our increasing size causes our growth rate to slow seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are unable to hire retain train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel particularly software engineering and sales personnel competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense especially in the san francisco bay area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have to provide more attractive compensation packages and other amenities research and development personnel are aggressively recruited by startup and growth companies which are especially active in many of the technical areas and geographic regions in which we conduct product development in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the hightechnology industry job candidates often consider the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to attract motivate or retain key employees if we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel or if there are delays in hiring required personnel our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be seriously harmed 

also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that such personnel has been improperly solicited that such personnel has divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that former employers own certain inventions or other work product such claims could result in litigation please see “—we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us” 

our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations our employment arrangements with our employees do not require that they continue to work for us for any specified period and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of our key personnel including jayshree ullal our chief executive officer andy bechtolsheim our founder and chief development officer and kenneth duda our founder chief technology officer and svp software engineering or other members of our senior management team sales and marketing team or engineering team or any difficulty attracting or retaining other highly qualified personnel in the future could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are subject to a number of risks associated with the expansion of our international sales and operations 

our ability to grow our business and our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide we have a limited history of marketing selling and supporting our products and services internationally operating in a global marketplace we are subject to risks associated with having an international reach and requirements such as compliance with applicable anticorruption laws 

one such applicable anticorruption law is the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and its employees and intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business securing an advantage and directing business to another and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors officers employees agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives as such if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation governmental authorities in the us and elsewhere could seek to impose civil andor criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions failure to comply with anticorruption and antibribery laws such as the fcpa and the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 or the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws associated with our activities outside the us could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences we intend to increase our international sales and business and as such the risk of violating laws such as the fcpa and united kingdom bribery act increases 

additionally as a result of our international reach we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or to recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the international markets that we serve may differ from those in the us and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in endcustomer contracts although to date we generally have not done so to the extent that we may enter into end 

customer contracts in the future that include nonstandard terms related to payment warranties or performance obligations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 

 these and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenue and consequently materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects expanding our existing international operations and entering into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial commitments our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit our future growth or materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings and our failure to offer highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

once our products are deployed within our end customers’ networks our end customers depend on our support organization and our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products highquality support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products if we or our channel partners do not assist our end customers in deploying our products effectively do not succeed in helping our end customers resolve postdeployment issues quickly or do not provide adequate ongoing support it could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing end customers and could harm our reputation with potential end customers in addition as we expand our operations internationally our support organization will face additional challenges including those associated with delivering support training and documentation in languages other than english our failure or the failure of our channel partners to maintain highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 

from time to time we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent copyright commercial product liability employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims in addition to governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources cause us to incur significant expenses or liability andor require us to change our business practices because of the potential risks expenses and uncertainties of litigation we may from time to time settle disputes even where we have meritorious claims or defenses by agreeing to settlement agreements because litigation is inherently unpredictable we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

for more information regarding the litigation in which we are currently involved see the “legal proceedings” subheading in note 5 commitments and contingencies of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology and network infrastructure spending may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology network connectivity and access to data and applications weak domestic or global economic conditions fear or anticipation of such conditions or a reduction in information technology and network infrastructure spending even if economic conditions improve could adversely affect our business financial condition results 

of operations and prospects in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our distributors reduced unit sales and lower or no growth for example the ongoing debt concerns in many countries in europe have caused and are likely to continue to cause uncertainty and instability in local economies and in global financial markets particularly if any future sovereign debt defaults or significant bank failures or defaults occur market uncertainty and instability in europe could intensify or spread further particularly if ongoing stabilization efforts prove insufficient concerns have been raised as to the financial political and legal ineffectiveness of measures taken to date continuing or worsening economic instability in europe and elsewhere could adversely affect spending for it network infrastructure systems and tools continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may also affect the overall demand for our products although we do not believe that our business financial condition results of operations and prospects have been significantly adversely affected by economic and political uncertainty in europe and other countries deterioration of such conditions may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in the future a prolonged period of economic uncertainty or a downturn may also significantly affect financing markets the availability of capital and the terms and conditions of financing arrangements including the overall cost of financing as well as the financial health or creditworthiness of our end customers circumstances may arise in which we need or desire to raise additional capital and such capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights or other lawsuits asserted against us could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network infrastructure industry and have resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies many companies in the network infrastructure industry including our competitors and other third parties as well as nonpracticing entities own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us from time to time they have or may in the future also assert such claims against us our end customers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties 

as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur claims of infringement misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase any claim of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim distract our management from our business and require us to cease use of such intellectual property in addition some claims for patent infringement may relate to subcomponents that we purchase from third parties if these third parties are unable or unwilling to indemnify us for these claims we could be substantially harmed 

the patent portfolios of most of our competitors are larger than ours this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent crosslicenses in addition future assertions of patent rights by third parties and any resulting litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection we cannot assure you that we are not infringing or otherwise violating any thirdparty intellectual property rights 

the thirdparty asserters of intellectual property claims may be unreasonable in their demands or may simply refuse to settle which could lead to expensive settlement payments prolonged periods of litigation and related expenses additional burdens on employees or other resources distraction from our business supply stoppages and lost sales 

an adverse outcome of a dispute including those lawsuits described under the “legal proceedings” subheading in note 5 commitments and contingencies of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k may require us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party’s patents cease making licensing or using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others expend additional development resources to attempt to redesign our products or services or otherwise to develop noninfringing technology which may not be successful enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or intellectual property rights and indemnify our partners and other third parties any damages or royalty obligations we may become subject to as a result of an adverse outcome and any thirdparty indemnity we may need to provide could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects royalty or licensing agreements if required or desirable may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures further there is little or no information publicly available concerning market or fair values for license fees which can lead to overpayment of license or settlement fees in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us suppliers subject to thirdparty intellectual property claims also may choose or be forced to discontinue or alter their arrangements with us with little or no advance notice to us any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our standard sales contracts contain indemnification provisions requiring us to defend our end customers against thirdparty claims including against infringement of certain intellectual property rights that could expose us to losses which could seriously harm our business financial conditions results of operations and prospects 

under the indemnification provisions of our standard sales contracts we agree to defend our end customers against thirdparty claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights which may include patents copyrights trademarks or trade secrets and to pay judgments entered on such claims for example we are currently involved in ongoing cisco litigation claims before the ustic an adverse ruling in such litigation may potentially expose us to claims in the event that claims are brought against our customers based on the ruling and we are required to indemnify such customers 

our exposure under these indemnification provisions is frequently limited to the total amount paid by our end customer under the agreement however certain agreements include indemnification provisions that could potentially expose us to losses in excess of the amount received under the agreement any of these events including claims for indemnification could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights 

we depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology we rely on trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection 

the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner we may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions further we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims to the extent that additional patents are issued from our patent applications which is not certain they may be contested circumvented or invalidated in the future moreover the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages and as with any technology competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future in addition we rely on confidentiality or license agreements with third parties in connection with their use of our products and technology there is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements or that we will be able to adequately enforce our rights in part because we rely on “shrinkwrap” licenses in some instances 

we have not registered our trademarks in all geographic markets failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our ability to enforce and defend our trademark rights and result in indemnification claims further any claim of infringement by a third party even those claims without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claim could divert management attention from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property in certain geographic markets 

despite our efforts the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the united states 

detecting and protecting against the unauthorized use of our products technology and proprietary rights is expensive difficult and in some cases impossible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources either of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and there is no guarantee that we would be successful furthermore many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to protecting their technology or intellectual property rights than we do accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property which could result in a substantial loss of our market share 

we rely on the availability of licenses to thirdparty software and other intellectual property 

many of our products and services include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties and we otherwise use software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties in our business this exposes us to risks over which we may have little or no control for example a licensor may have difficulties keeping up with technological changes or may stop supporting the software or other intellectual property that it licenses to us also it will be necessary in the future to renew licenses expand the scope of existing licenses or seek new licenses relating to various aspects of these products and services or otherwise relating to our business which may result in increased license fees these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms if at all in addition a third party may assert that we or our end customers are in breach of the terms of a license which could among other things give such third party the right to terminate a license or seek damages from us or both the inability to obtain or maintain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain or maintain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in releases of products and services and could otherwise disrupt our business until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and services or otherwise in the conduct of our business moreover the inclusion in our products and services of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis may limit our 

ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software that we use if we combine our software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release portions of the source code of our software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products moreover we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products will be effective if we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products on terms that are not economically feasible to reengineer our products to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available in source code form our proprietary code any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

sales of our 7000 series of switches generate most of our product revenue and if we are unable to continue to grow sales of these products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

historically we have derived substantially all of our product revenue from sales of our 7000 series of switches and we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future a decline in the price of these products and related services or our inability to increase sales of these products would harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects more seriously than if we derived significant revenue from a larger variety of product lines and services our future financial performance will also depend upon successfully developing and selling nextgeneration versions of our 7000 series of switches if we fail to deliver new products new features or new releases that end customers want and that allow us to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and to be adversely affected by numerous factors 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and to be affected by numerous factors including 

 to remain competitive we must successfully manage product introductions and transitions 

the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the 

availability of new merchant silicon chips the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly we cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on our business and results of operations 

our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense as a result our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly 

the timing of our sales and revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of our products’ sales cycles a sales cycle is the period between initial contact with a prospective end customer and any sale of our products endcustomer orders often involve the purchase of multiple products these orders are complex and difficult to complete because prospective end customers generally consider a number of factors over an extended period of time before committing to purchase the products and solutions we sell end customers especially in the case of our large end customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision and require considerable time to evaluate test and qualify our products prior to making a purchase decision and placing an order the length of time that end customers devote to their evaluation contract negotiation and budgeting processes varies significantly our products’ sales cycles can be lengthy in certain cases especially with respect to our prospective large end customers during the sales cycle we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities and make investments in evaluation equipment all of which lower our operating margins particularly if no sale occurs even if an end customer decides to purchase our products there are many factors affecting the timing of our recognition of revenue which makes our revenue difficult to forecast for example there may be unexpected delays in an end customer’s internal procurement processes particularly for some of our larger end customers for which our products represent a very small percentage of their total procurement activity there are many other factors specific to end customers that contribute to the timing of their purchases and the variability of our revenue recognition including the strategic importance of a particular project to an end customer budgetary constraints and changes in their personnel 

even after an end customer makes a purchase there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase for example the sale of our products may be subject to acceptance testing in addition the significance and timing of our product enhancements and the introduction of new products by our competitors may also affect end customers’ purchases for all of these reasons it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed the particular period in which a sale will be completed or the period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized if our sales cycles lengthen our revenue could be lower than expected which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on end customers renewing their maintenance and support contracts any decline in maintenance renewals could harm our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we typically sell our products with maintenance and support as part of the initial purchase and a portion of our annual revenue comes from renewals of maintenance and support contracts our end customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance and support contracts after the expiration of the initial period and they may elect not to renew their maintenance and support contracts to renew their maintenance and support contracts at lower prices through alternative channel partners or to reduce the product quantity under their maintenance and support contracts thereby reducing our future revenue from maintenance and support contracts if our end customers especially our large end customers do not renew their maintenance and support contracts or if they renew them on terms that are less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

most of our competitors have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example in the last few years alone dell acquired force10 ibm acquired blade network technology hewlett packard acquired 3com brocade acquired foundry networks juniper acquired contrail and vmware acquired nicira 

moreover large system vendors are increasingly seeking to deliver toptobottom cloud networking solutions to end customers that combine cloudfocused hardware and software solutions to provide an alternative to our products 

we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete with us including any competitors that seek to become sole source vendors for end customers this could lead to more variability in our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release they have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product defects or errors could affect the performance of 

our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our end customers’ willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our products could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our products could result in claims by end customers for losses that they sustain if end customers make these types of claims we may be required or may choose for endcustomer relations or other reasons to expend additional resources in order to address the problem we may also be required to repair or replace such products or provide a refund for the purchase price for such products liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale and those of our resellers and distributors may not be enforceable under some circumstances or may not fully or effectively protect us from endcustomer claims and related liabilities and costs including indemnification obligations under our agreements with end customers resellers and distributors the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain types of claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any such claims in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in expenditures of funds in connection with litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

in addition to our own direct sales force we rely on distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers to sell our products and our failure to effectively develop manage or prevent disruptions to our distribution channels and the processes and procedures that support them could cause a reduction in the number of end customers of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon maintaining our relationships with distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers and establishing additional sales channel relationships we anticipate that sales of our products to a limited number of channel partners will continue to account for a material portion of our total product revenue for the foreseeable future we provide our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our products but these steps may not be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services if we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive programs for our channel partners we may not be able to incentivize these partners to sell our products to end customers these partners may have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our products altogether one of our channel partners could elect to consolidate or enter into a strategic partnership with one of our competitors which could reduce or eliminate our future opportunities with that channel partner our agreements with our channel partners may generally be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice we may be unable to retain these channel partners or secure additional or replacement channel partners the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners requires extensive training and any new or expanded relationship with a channel partner may take several months or more to achieve productivity 

where we rely on the channel partners for sales of our products we may have little or no contact with the ultimate users of our products that purchase through such channel partners thereby making it more difficult for us to establish brand awareness ensure proper delivery and installation of our products service ongoing endcustomer requirements estimate endcustomer demand and respond to evolving endcustomer needs in addition our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to end customers fail to comply with their contractual obligations or violate laws or our corporate policies if we fail to effectively manage our existing sales channels or if our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our products if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of highquality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

we anticipate increasing our sales efforts to us and foreign federal state and local governmental end customers in the future sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we have attained revised certifications government demand and payment for our products and services may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects selling to government entities may also require us to comply with various regulations that are not applicable to sales to nongovernment entities including regulations that may relate to pricing classified material and other matters complying with such regulations may also require us to put in place controls and procedures to monitor compliance with the applicable regulations that may be costly or not possible we are not currently certified to perform work under classified contracts with government entities failure to comply with any such regulations could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit 

could result in the government ceasing to buy our products and services a reduction of revenue fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the us government may require certain products that it purchases to be manufactured in the us and other relatively highcost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet these requirements any of these and other circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products must interoperate with operating systems software applications and hardware that is developed by others and if we are unable to devote the necessary resources to ensure that our products interoperate with such software and hardware we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening demand for our products 

generally our products comprise only a part of the data center and must interoperate with our end customers’ existing infrastructure specifically their networks servers software and operating systems which may be manufactured by a wide variety of vendors and original equipment manufacturers or oems our products must comply with established industry standards in order to interoperate with the servers storage software and other networking equipment in the data center such that all systems function efficiently together we depend on the vendors of servers and systems in a data center to support prevailing industry standards often these vendors are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are also some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our end customers 

in addition when new or updated versions of these software operating systems or applications are introduced we must sometimes develop updated versions of our software so that our products will interoperate properly we may not accomplish these development efforts quickly costeffectively or at all these development efforts require capital investment and the devotion of engineering resources if we fail to maintain compatibility with these systems and applications our end customers may not be able to adequately utilize our products and we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening in demand for our products among other consequences which would adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls 

our products may be subject to various export controls and because we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products certain of our products may be exported from various countries only with the required export license or through an export license exception if we were to fail to comply with the applicable export control laws customs regulations economic sanctions or other applicable laws we could be subject to monetary damages or the imposition of restrictions which could be material to our business operating results and prospects and could also harm our reputation further there could be criminal penalties for knowing or willful violations including incarceration for culpable employees and managers obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities furthermore certain export control and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products technology software and services to embargoed countries and sanctioned governments entities and persons even though we take precautions to ensure that our channel partners comply with all relevant regulations any failure by our channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences including reputational harm government investigations and penalties 

as our company grows we also continue developing procedures and controls to comply with export control and other applicable laws historically we have had some instances where we inadvertently have not fully complied with certain export control laws but we have disclosed them to and implemented corrective actions with the appropriate government agencies 

in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including through import permit and license requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our end customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential end customers with international operations or create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business is subject to regulation by various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the united states from time to time we may receive inquiries from such governmental agencies or we may make voluntary disclosures regarding our compliance with applicable governmental regulations or requirements relating to importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations which could lead to formal investigations noncompliance with applicable government regulations or requirements could subject us to sanctions mandatory product 

recalls enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages civil and criminal penalties or injunctions if any governmental sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected in addition responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we may invest in or acquire other businesses which could require significant management attention disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we have and may continue to make investments in complementary companies products or technologies which could involve licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in or acquisitions of other companies however we do not have significant experience in making investments in other companies nor have we made any acquisitions to date and as a result our ability as an organization to evaluate andor complete investments or acquire and integrate other companies products or technologies in a successful manner is unproven we may not be able to find suitable investment or acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete such investments or acquisitions on favorable terms if at all if we do complete investments or acquisitions we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and any investments or acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end customers investors and securities analysts 

in addition investments and acquisitions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures for example if we are unsuccessful at integrating any acquisitions or retaining key talent from those acquisitions or the technologies associated with such acquisitions into our company the business financial condition results of operations and prospects of the combined company could be adversely affected any integration process may require significant time and resources and we may not be able to manage the process successfully we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel or accurately forecast the financial effects of an acquisition transaction including accounting charges we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such investment or acquisition each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations moreover if the investment or acquisition becomes impaired we may be required to take an impairment charge which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock 

if we needed to raise additional capital to expand our operations and invest in new products our failure to do so on favorable terms could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future if we did need to raise additional funds to expand our operations and invest in new products we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms if at all if we raise additional equity financing our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our common stock could decline furthermore if we engage in debt financing the holders of such debt would have priority over the holders of common stock and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or impose other restrictions on our business we may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders including maintaining specified liquidity or other ratios any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms if at all we may not be able to among other things 

 our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as described in part ii item 7 of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities equity revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation contract manufacturing liabilities and income taxes if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions our results of operations may be adversely 

affected and may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

we are exposed to the credit risk of our channel partners and some of our end customers which could result in material losses   

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with standard payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the us we monitor individual endcustomer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the end customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts we are unable to recognize revenue from shipments until the collection of those amounts becomes reasonably assured any significant delay or default in the collection of significant accounts receivable could result in an increased need for us to obtain working capital from other sources possibly on worse terms than we could have negotiated if we had established such working capital resources prior to such delays or defaults any significant default could adversely affect our results of operations and delay our ability to recognize revenue 

a material portion of our sales is derived through our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers some of our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers may experience financial difficulties which could adversely affect our collection of accounts receivable distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other systems integrators valueadded resellers and end customers distributors represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be less likely to have the reserve resources required to meet payment obligations our exposure to credit risks of our channel partners may increase if our channel partners and their end customers are adversely affected by global or regional economic conditions one or more of these channel partners could delay payments or default on credit extended to them either of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we or our partners fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition results of operations prospects and reputation could be adversely affected 

we and our partners including our contract manufacturers are subject to various local state federal and international environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection recycling and disposal of electrical and electronic equipment examples of these laws and regulations include the european union or eu restrictions on the use of hazardous substances directive or rohs directive and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive or weee directive as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the us and we or our partners including our contract manufacturers are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

the eu rohs directive and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products our products currently comply with the rohs directive however if there are future changes to this directive we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes our failure or the failure of our partners including our contract manufacturers to comply with past present and future environmental laws could result in fines penalties thirdparty claims reduced sales of our products substantial product inventory writeoffs and reputational damage any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we also expect that our business will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis applicable to us and our partners including our contract manufacturers to date our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows although we cannot predict the future effect of such laws or regulations they will likely result in additional costs or require us to change the content or manufacturing of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening us dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our end customers outside of the us which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase our product and operating costs in foreign locations further an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the us is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates if we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with the currency fluctuations our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

our corporate headquarters and the operations of our key manufacturing vendors logistics providers and partners as well as many of our customers are located in areas exposed to risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis including the san francisco bay area japan and taiwan a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake tsunami fire or a flood or other catastrophic event such as a disease outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our or their business which could in turn materially affect our financial condition results of operations and prospects for example in the event our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed which could result in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter further if a natural disaster occurs in a region from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue end customers in that region may delay or forego purchases of our products which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturer logistics providers partners or end customers or the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end any disruption in the business of our manufacturer logistics providers partners or end customers that affects sales at the end of our quarter could have a particularly significant adverse effect on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if our disaster recovery plans and those of our manufacturers logistics providers or partners prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of endcustomer orders or delays in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected 

breaches of our cybersecurity systems could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services to our customers delay our ability to recognize revenue compromise the integrity of our software products result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property damage our reputation expose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data 

we increasingly depend upon our it systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or that of our website and misappropriate our proprietary information or cause interruptions of our service because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system we have also outsourced a number of our business functions to thirdparties including our manufacturers logistics providers and cloud service providers and our business operations also depend in part on the success of these third parties own cybersecurity measures similarly we rely upon distributors resellers and system integrators to sell our products and our sales operations depend in part on the reliability of their cybersecurity measures additionally we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our it resources in safe and secure fashion that does not expose our network systems to security breaches and the loss of data accordingly if our cybersecurity systems and those of our contractors fail to protect against unauthorized access sophisticated cyber attacks and the mishandling of data by our employees and contractors our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways including 

 should any of the above events occur we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our customers and regulatory actions from governmental agencies in addition our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised and our reputation and competitive position could be significantly harmed also the regulatory and contractual actions litigations investigations fines penalties and liabilities relating to data breaches that result in losses of personally identifiable or credit card information of users of our services can be significant in terms of fines and reputational impact and necessitate changes to our business operations that may be disruptive to us additionally we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and remediate damages consequently our financial performance and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we believe our longterm value as a company will be greater if we focus primarily on growth instead of profitability 

our business strategy is to focus primarily on our longterm growth as a result our profitability in any given period may be lower than it would be if our strategy was to maximize shortterm profitability expenditures on research and development sales and 

marketing infrastructure and other such investments may not ultimately grow our business prospects or cause long term profitability for example in order to support our strong growth we have accelerated our investment in infrastructure such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations as a result we expect our levels of operating profit could decline in the short to medium term if we are ultimately unable to achieve profitability at the level anticipated by analysts and our stockholders the market price of our common stock may decline 

we may not generate positive returns on our research and development investments 

developing our products is expensive and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle in 2015  2014  and 2013  our research and development expenses were 2094 million or approximately 250 of our revenue 1489 million  or approximately 255  of our revenue and 986 million  or approximately 273  of our revenue respectively we expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts by investing in research and development we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity we expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these investments these investments may take several years to generate positive returns if ever 

we provide access to our software and other selected source code to certain partners which creates additional risk that our competitors could develop products that are similar to or better than ours 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our internally developed technology which is incorporated in the source code for our products we seek to protect the source code design code documentation and other information relating to our software under trade secret patent and copyright laws however we have chosen to provide access to selected source code of our software to several of our partners for codevelopment as well as for open application programming interfaces or apis formats and protocols though we generally control access to our source code and other intellectual property and enter into confidentiality or license agreements with such partners as well as with our employees and consultants this combination of procedural and contractual safeguards may be insufficient to protect our trade secrets and other rights to our technology our protective measures may be inadequate especially because we may not be able to prevent our partners employees or consultants from violating any agreements or licenses we may have in place or abusing their access granted to our source code improper disclosure or use of our source code could help competitors develop products similar to or better than ours 

changes in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application of existing tax laws of various jurisdictions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including earnings that are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our ability to generate and use tax attributes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the federal research and development rd tax credit laws transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement and legal structure tax effects of nondeductible compensation including certain stockbased compensation tax costs related to intercompany realignments changes in accounting principles adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries or customers a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings or changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules 

significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions and determine our provision for income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital in addition tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied recent changes to us tax laws including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the us are repatriated to the us as well as changes to us tax laws that may be enacted in the future could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings as well as cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain outside of the us 

further we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities audits by the internal revenue service or other tax authorities are subject to inherent uncertainties and could result in unfavorable outcomes including potential fines or penalties as we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions the expense of defending and resolving such an audit may be significant the amount of time to resolve an audit is also unpredictable and may divert management’s attention from our business operations we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we cannot assure you that fluctuations in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application or interpretation of existing tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns by tax authorities will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we do not effectively expand and train our direct sales force we may be unable to add new end customers or increase sales to our existing end customers and our business will be adversely affected 

we depend on our direct sales force to obtain new end customers and increase sales with existing end customers as such we have invested and will continue to invest substantially in our sales organization in recent periods we have been adding personnel and other resources to our sales function as we focus on growing our business entering new markets and increasing our market share and we expect to incur significant additional expenses in expanding our sales personnel in order to achieve revenue growth there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training retaining and integrating sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth particularly in international markets new hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect and we may be unable to hire retain or integrate into our corporate culture sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business in addition because we continue to grow rapidly a large percentage of our sales force is new to our company if we are unable to hire integrate and train a sufficient number of effective sales personnel or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new end customers or increasing sales to our existing endcustomer base our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products 

as a public company we are subject to requirements under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act that will require us to perform diligence and disclose and report whether or not our products contain conflict minerals the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements including costs related to conducting diligence procedures and if applicable potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities we may also face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflictfree or if we are unable to alter our products processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials 

risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock   

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the value of your investment could decline 

technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in june 2014 at the price of 4300 per share our stock price has ranged from 4300 per share to 9484 per share through december 31 2015 the trading price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following 

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition results of operations and 

prospects the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company if the market price of our common stock is volatile we may become the target of securities litigation securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business and prospects this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that such sales might occur could reduce the market price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate 

based on shares outstanding as of december 31 2015  holders of up to approximately 21270434 shares or 312 of our common stock have rights subject to some conditions to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders in addition we have registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans if holders by exercising their registration rights sell large numbers of shares it could adversely affect our market price 

we may also issue shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing acquisition investments or otherwise any such issuances would result in dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

insiders have substantial control over us which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions including a change of control 

our directors executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 5 of our outstanding common stock together with their affiliates in the aggregate beneficially own approximately 438 of the outstanding shares of our common stock based on shares outstanding as of december 31 2015  as a result these stockholders if acting together could exercise a significant level of influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests this concentration of ownership may also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock or otherwise may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change of control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock 

we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared nor paid any dividends on our common stock we intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and prospects and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases 

if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business or prospects the market price of our common stock and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock to some extent depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business or prospects we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares the market price of our common stock would likely decline if one or more of these analysts should cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which could cause the market price of our common stock or trading volume to decline 

our charter documents and delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

 39 

 in addition as a delaware corporation we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law these provisions may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time 

the issuance of additional stock in connection with financings acquisitions investments our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 1000000000 shares of common stock and up to 100000000 shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations we may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing acquisition investment our stock incentive plans or otherwise we may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock at a discount from the then market price of our common stock any issuance of stock could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of our common stock to decline

overview 

we are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration data centers for enterprise support our cloud networking solutions consist of our extensible operating system or eos a set of network applications and our ethernet switches our cloud networking solutions deliver industryleading performance scalability availability programmability automation and visibility at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was purposebuilt to be fully programmable and highly modular the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services 

we were founded in 2004 to address the limitations of legacy networking products and to create a cloud networking platform that is open and programmable from 2004 to 2008 our activities were focused on the development of our software which resulted in the commercial release of our first product the 7100 series switches based on our eos software in 2008 since then we have continued to introduce new products utilizing eos including our 7500 series switch and our 7050 series switch in 2010 the second generation of our 7500 series switch called the 7500e modular switch in may 2013 our 7300 series switch in november 2013 our 7280e in july 2014 in december 2014 we introduced our eos software platform for networking programmability and automation and in june 2015 we introduced cloudvision a networkwide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation in september 2015 we introduced our macro segmentation services “mss” to provide automated insertion of security and other inline layer 47 services within any software driven cloud networking infrastructure mss has been endorsed by many of our technology alliance ecosystem partners with whom we are currently partnering with to deliver mss platform support we also introduced our first 10254050100g switches with our 7060 7260 and 7320 series switches 

as of december 31 2015 we have shipped more than five million switch ports we have experienced rapid revenue growth over the last several years increasing our revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 564 from 2011 to 2015 as we have grown the functionality of our eos software expanded the range of our switching portfolio and increased the size of our sales force our revenue has continued to grow rapidly to support our customers and revenue growth we have expanded our international presence to include 20 foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2015 including for example australia canada france germany india ireland japan south korea and the united kingdom our revenue for the year ended december 31 2015 was 8376 million an increase of 434 compared to the same period in 2014 we have been profitable and cash flow positive for each year since 2010 

we believe that our cloud networking platform addresses the large and growing cloud networking segment of data center switching which remains in the early stage of adoption we expect to continue rapidly growing our organization to meet the needs of new and existing customers as they increasingly realize the performance and cost benefits of our cloud networking solutions and as they expand their cloud networks we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our rapid development of new features and applications we intend to continue expanding our sales and marketing teams and programs and carrying out associated marketing activities in key geographies in order to support our strong growth we have and may continue to accelerate our investment in infrastructure such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations as a result our levels of operating profit as a percentage of revenue could decline in the short to medium term for a description of factors that may impact our future performance see the disclosure in the section titled factors affecting our performance below 

our business model 

we derive revenue from sales of products and services we generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our eos software we generate the majority of our services revenue from post contract support or pcs which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products 

since shipping our first products in 2008 our cumulative endcustomer base has grown rapidly between december 31 2011 and december 31 2015 our cumulative endcustomer base grew from approximately 1100 to over 3700 our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others 

to continue to grow our revenue it is important that we both obtain new customers and sell additional products to existing customers our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our eos software and enhancements to eos we engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture today we combine our eos software with merchant silicon into a family of switching products this enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions we currently procure certain merchant silicon components from multiple vendors and we continue to expand our relationships with these and other vendors we work closely with third party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third party direct fulfillment facilities where our eos software is installed on our products we and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling final configuration quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers 

we market and sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners including distributors valueadded resellers system integrators original equipment manufacturer or “oem” partners and in conjunction with various technology partners to facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity we have created a partner program the arista partner program to engage partners who provide valueadded services and extend our reach into the marketplace authorized training partners provide technical training to our channel partners our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for presales technical support and engineering for our end customers each sales team is responsible for a geographic territory has responsibility for a number of major direct endcustomer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 773 797 and 829 of our revenue was generated from the americas substantially all from the us 153 128 and 112 from europe the middle east and africa and 74 75 and 59 from the asiapacific region respectively 

factors affecting our performance 

we believe that our future success will depend on many factors including our ability to expand sales to our existing customers as well as to add new end customers while these areas present significant opportunity they also present risks that we must manage to ensure successful results see the section titled “risk factors” additionally we face intense competition especially from larger wellestablished companies and we must continue to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform to succeed in our market we are also currently engaged in lawsuits with cisco our largest competitor whereby they claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we intend to vigorously defend against these cisco lawsuits as summarized in the legal proceedings section below however we cannot be certain that   any claims by cisco would be resolved in our favor if we are unable to address these challenges our business could be adversely affected 

increasing adoption of cloud networks networks are subject to increasing performance requirements due to growing numbers of connected devices as well as new enterprise and consumer applications computing architectures are evolving to meet the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications we believe that cloud networks will continue to replace legacy network technologies our business and results of operations will be significantly affected by the speed with which organizations implement cloud networks 

expanding sales to existing customer base we expect that a substantial portion of our future sales will be followon sales to existing end customers as noted above one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our cloud networking solutions thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers we believe this opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing and expected infrastructure spend we expect our business and results of operations will depend on our ability to sell additional products to our growing base of customers 

adding new end customers we believe that the cloud networking market is still in the early stages of adoption we intend to target new end customers by continuing to invest in our field sales force and extending our relationships with channel technology and systemlevel partners to date we have primarily targeted end customers with the largest cloud data centers a typical initial order involves the education of prospective customers about the technical merits and capabilities and potential cost savings of our products as compared to our competitors’ products our results of operations will depend on our ability to continue to add new customers we believe that 

customer references have been and will continue to be an important factor in winning new business with special emphasis on four key verticals the cloud titans financial services service and internet hosting providers and high tech enterprises 

selling more complex and higherperformance configurations  our results of operations have been and we believe will continue to be affected by our ability to sell more complex and higherperformance configurations of our products our ability to sustain our revenue growth will depend in part upon our continued sales of these more robust configurations and quarterly results of operations can be significantly impacted by the mix of products and product configurations sold during the period 

leveraging channel partners we expect to continue to derive a growing portion of our sales through our channel partners as they develop new end customers and expand sales to our existing end customers we plan to continue to invest in our network of channel partners to enable them to reach new end customers more effectively increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support effectively we believe that increasing channel leverage will extend and improve our engagement with a broad set of customers 

investing in research and development for growth we believe that the market for cloud networking is still in the early stages of adoption and we intend to continue investing for longterm growth we expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products including new releases and upgrades to our eos software and new applications building upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts by investing in research and development we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity we expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these product development investments 

customer concentration and timing of large orders  historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for significant portion of our revenue during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 our largest end customer accounted for 120 149 and 219 of our revenue respectively we have also experienced and continue to experience customer concentration on a quarterly basis in addition we have experienced increases in the size of our orders including orders from existing customers which could result in future increased customer concentration depending on the timing of the fulfillment of those orders we have also experienced unpredictability in the timing of large orders especially with respect to our large end customers due to the complexity of orders the time it takes end customers to evaluate test qualify and accept our products and factors specific to our end customers due to these factors we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis in addition we have provided and may in the future provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers 

basis of presentation 

revenue 

we generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our eos software we also derive a portion of our revenue from sales of post contract support or pcs and to a lesser extent professional services we generate pcs revenue from sales of technical support services contracts that are typically purchased in conjunction with our products and subsequent renewals of those contracts we offer pcs services under renewable feebased contracts which include 24hour technical support hardware repair and replacement parts bug fixes patches and unspecified upgrades on a whenandif available basis we expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on among other things the timing and size of orders the delivery and acceptance of products the impact of significant transactions with unique terms and conditions that may require deferral of revenue and cyclicality of orders being placed by our customers additionally we expect pcs revenue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our installed base our ability to expand our installed base and increase our revenue is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties see the section titled “risk factors” we report revenue net of sales taxes 

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our thirdparty contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors overhead costs in our manufacturing operations department and other manufacturingrelated costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory we expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases cost of providing pcs and other services consists primarily of personnel costs for our global customer support organization we expect our cost of service revenue to increase as our pcs revenue increases 

gross margin 

gross margin or gross profit as a percentage of revenue has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing the average sales price of our offerings manufacturing costs merchant silicon costs and the mix of products sold we expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above and others see the section titled “risk factors” 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs personnel costs consist of wages benefits bonuses and with respect to sales and marketing expenses sales commissions personnel costs also include stockbased compensation and travel expenses we expect operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as we continue to invest in the growth of our business

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and also include costs related to marketing and promotional activities with the remainder being an allocated portion of facility and it costs and depreciation we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide and expand our relationships with current and future channel partners and end customers

other income expense net 

interest expense 

interest expense consists of interest expense on our subordinated convertible promissory notes including our related party subordinated convertible promissory notes which were converted during fiscal 2014 and interest expense from our lease financing obligation 

other income expense 

other income expense consists of gains on investments writeoffs of debt discount on notes payable which were repaid and converted during fiscal 2014 and foreign currency exchange gains and losses our foreign currency exchange gains and losses relate to transactions and asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we expect our foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

provision for income taxes 

we operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to us income tax generally our us tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these earnings which avoids double taxation our tax expense to date consists of federal state and foreign current and deferred income taxes as we expand internationally our marginal tax rate may decrease however there can be no certainty that our marginal tax rate will decrease and we may experience changes in tax rates that are not reflective of actual changes in our business or operations 

we account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements but have not been reflected in our taxable income estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards we measure deferred income tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize 

we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes historical results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of revenue for those periods we have derived the data for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  from our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in thus form 10k in thousands except for percentage of revenue

year ended december 31 2015 compared to year ended december 31 2014 

revenue cost of revenue and gross profit in thousands except percentages 

revenue product revenue increased 401 in the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 2014 we increased shipments to our existing customers during the year as they continued to grow their businesses and increase their demand for our switch products and related accessories in addition we continued to add new customers as we expanded our market presence and geographic footprint service revenue increased 764 in the year ended december 31 2015 with growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand we also continued to experience fluctuations in product and service pricing due to competitive market pressures however these were more than offset by the increased demand drivers outlined above 

cost of revenue and gross margin gross margin decreased from 671 to 649 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 this decrease in 2015 was primarily due to increased inventoryrelated obsolescence charges associated with upcoming product transitions and higher warranty costs in addition to a greater mix of revenue from larger customers who typically receive higher discounts 

operating expenses in thousands except percentages 

research and development research and development expenses increased 605 million or 407 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 333 million resulting from increases in headcount stock based compensation as well as additional bonus expense under our corporate bonus plan prototype spend and thirdparty engineering and consulting costs increased by 142 million and facilities and it infrastructure costs increased 86 million due to new product introductions and the continued expansion and support of our research and development activities 

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased 237 million or 278 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 170 million resulting from increased headcount and additional sales commissions the increase also related to additional product field demonstration costs of 60 million 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased 434 million or 1342 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 the increase was due to an increase in legal fees of 398 million primarily related to the cisco and optumsoft legal matters outlined in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in addition personnel costs increased by 41 million reflecting additional bonus cost under our corporate bonus program and increased stockbased compensation charges during 2015 

other income expense net in thousands except percentages 

interest expense the reduction in interest expense during the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 is primarily related to repayment and conversion of our notes payable upon closing of our initial public offering during the second quarter of 2014 

other income expense net  the unfavorable change in other income expense net during the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to a onetime gain on our notes receivable of 40 million in 2014 partially offset by a 07 million writeoff related to the debt discount on notes payable during the second quarter of 2014 and a reduction in transactional exchange rate losses during 2015 

provision for income taxes in thousands except percentages 

provision for income taxes was approximately 249 million and 347 million for the year ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the change in our provision was the result of an increase in profit before income taxes offset by a decrease due to foreign mix earnings taxed at a lower rate than the us tax rate release of reserves due to expiration of the statute of limitations in certain domestic jurisdictions and reinstatement of the federal research and development rd credit 

the rd credit which was made permanent under protecting americans from tax hikes path act signed into law on december 18 2015 the impact of the 2015 federal rd tax credit benefit was recorded in the fourth quarter of the year ended december 31 2015 

year ended december 31 2014 compared to year ended december 31 2013 

revenue cost of revenue and gross profit in thousands except percentages 

revenue revenue increased 2229 million  or 617  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013  the increase in revenue was predominately driven by increased product shipments to existing customers due to increased demand for our switch products and related accessories in addition our cumulative number of customers grew approximately 33 from december 31 2013 to december 31 2014 as we continued to broaden our market penetration 

cost of revenue and gross margin gross margin increased from 660  for the year ended december 31 2013  to 671  for 2014 the increase in gross margin was primarily the result of specific warranty and excess and obsolete inventoryrelated charges of 103 million recorded in 2013 that did not recur in 2014 to a lesser extent gross margin in 2014 was negatively impacted by a decrease in product margins due to a higher revenue mix from larger customers who typically receive higher volume discounts 

operating expenses in thousands except percentages 

research and development research and development expenses increased 503 million  or 510  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013 the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 390 million resulting from an increase of 156 employees a 341 increase from december 31 2013 to december 31 2014 and additional bonus expenses under our corporate bonus plan the increase was also due to an increase of 66 million in research and development related facilities and it infrastructure costs and increases in thirdparty engineering costs of 59 million and depreciation expense of 20 million as we continued to expand and support our research and development activities these expenses were partially offset by a 43 million reduction in prototype spending related to project timing 

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased 302 million  or 548  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013 the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 234 million resulting from an increase of 45 employees a 230 increase from december 31 2013 to december 31 2014 as well as an increase in sales commissions resulting from higher sales volume the increase was also due to an increase of 37 million in product demonstrations expenses incurred to expand our sales engineering labs to support our growing customer base consulting expenses 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased 136 million  or 730  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013 the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 57 million resulting from an increase of 17 employees a 298 increase from december 31 2013 to december 31 2014 and additional expenses under our corporate bonus plan we also incurred higher professional service fees of 37 million related to outside legal accounting and consulting services to support increased business activity litigation and publiccompany activities the increase was also attributable to higher insurance expense and franchise taxes of 15 million associated with being a public company and a 10 million charitable donation through a fund established by the company in 2014 

other income expense net in thousands except percentages 

interest expense interest expense decreased during the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013 as a result of repayment and conversion of our notes payable upon our ipo during the second quarter of 2014 

other income expense net  other income expense net increased for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013 due to the gain on our notes receivable of 40 million offset by a 07 million writeoff related to the debt discount on notes payable upon our ipo further offset by net transactional exchange rate losses 

provision for income taxes in thousands except percentages 

provision for income taxes was approximately 347 million  and 158 million  for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively provision for income taxes increased 188 million  or 1191  for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 2013 the change in our provision for income taxes was primarily due to an increase in profit before income tax the change in the effective tax rate was a result of the geographical distribution of the earnings the federal rd tax credit for 2014 including only a current year benefit as compared to a twoyear federal rd tax credit benefit for 2013 and an increase in state taxes 

the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2014 included the impact of the reinstatement of the 2014 rd credit the impact of the 2014 federal rd tax credit benefit was recorded in the fourth quarter of the year ended december 31 2014 the effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2013 included the impact of the reinstatement of the 2013 and 2012 federal rd tax credits 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations as of december 31 2015 cash and cash equivalents were 6873 million of which approximately 416 million was held outside the us in our foreign subsidiaries we have not repatriated nor do we currently have plans to repatriate these funds but if we were to repatriate cash held outside of the us for domestic cash operations we would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes to repatriate these funds less any previously paid foreign income taxes we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2015 to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us income taxes have been provided thereon 

our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes we plan to continue to invest for longterm growth we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for the foreseeable future our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings our costs and access to outsourcing our manufacturing our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies the continued market acceptance of our products and costs incurred related to outstanding litigation claims if we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all if we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

cash flows 





cash flows from operating activities 

our primary source of cash from operating activities has been from cash collections from our customers we expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increased sales and timing of collections our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs inventory purchases from our contract manufacturer investment in research and development and litigation expenses 

during the year ended december 31 2015 cash provided by operating activities was 2005 million primarily from net income of 1211 million net noncash charges of 12 million and a net increase in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 806 million the net increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of 903 million largely related to short and longterm services contracts and product revenue deferrals related to contracts with acceptance terms in addition we experienced an increase in cash of 320 million from income taxes payable and an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities of 294 million due to the timing of payments these operating liability increases were offset by an increase in our accounts receivable of 473 million resulting from an increase in sales during the period in addition inventory increased 141 million during the period due to higher shipment volume and prepaid expenses and current assets increased 78 million in the period 

during the year ended december 31 2014  cash provided by operating activities was 1319 million  primarily from net income of 869 million  net noncash charges of 110 million and an increase of 332 million  due to changes in our operating assets and 

liabilities the increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due an increase in deferred revenue of 476 million  resulting from the increase in sales an increase in accrued liabilities of 189 million  largely related to our payroll and corporate bonus plan and an increase in accounts payable of 140 million  due to the timing of our payments partially offset by a reduction in cash from an increase in accounts receivable of 190 million  from higher products shipments an increase in inventories of 134 million  to meet our customer demand an increase of 153 million  in cash paid for income taxes and supplier rebates receivable resulting from our increased inventory purchases 

during the year ended december 31 2013 cash provided by operating activities was 346 million  primarily from net income of 425 million  and noncash charges of 66 million partially offset by a decrease of 146 million  due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities the decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a 492 million  increase in inventory for anticipated growth in our business a 281 million increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in sales partially offset by an increase in cash from a 30 million  decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets partially offset by an increase in cash from a 39 million  increase in accounts payable primarily attributable to the timing of payments a 120 million  increase in accrued liabilities attributable to higher warranty liabilities and higher accrued personnel costs due to growth in headcount a 341 million  increase in deferred revenue due to increased sales and a 60 million increase in interest payable attributable to our outstanding convertible promissory notes including our related party convertible promissory notes 

cash flows from investing activities 

our investing activities have consisted primarily of capital expenditures and net investment purchases of available for sale marketable securities we expect to continue investing in these activities to support the continued growth of our business 

during the year ended december 31 2015 cash provided by investing activities was 1842 million consisting of proceeds from the maturity of availableforsale securities of 2082 million offset by purchases of property equipment and other assets of 192 million and increase in restricted cash of 40 million related to a security deposit required for a facility lease 

during the year ended december 31 2014 cash used in investing activities was 2494 million  consisting primarily of purchases of marketable securities of 2100 million  purchases of property and equipment of 131 million  and other investing activities of 382 million  largely due to a 336 million equity investments in privately held companies partially offset by the proceeds of the repayments of our notes receivable of 80 million  and the release of our restricted cash into cash and cash equivalents of 40 million  

during the year ended december 31 2013 cash used in investing activities was 195 million  of which 203 million  relates to the purchase of property and equipment offset by notes receivable repayments of 10 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

during the year ended december 31 2015 cash provided by financing activities was 631 million consisting primarily of the excess tax benefit associated with equity incentive plans of 373 million proceeds from the exercise of stock options net of repurchases of 178 million and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our espp of 94 million 

during the year ended december 31 2014  cash provided by financing activities was 2440 million  consisting primarily of net proceeds raised from our initial public offering of 2393 million  proceeds from the exercise of stock options net of repurchases of 80 million  and excess tax benefits from our equity incentive plans amounting to 174 million  these proceeds were partially offset by the repayment of our notes payable of 200 million  

during the year ended december 31 2013 cash provided by financing activities was 99 million  consisting primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options net of repurchases amounting to 90 million  and excess tax benefits associated with our equity incentive plans amounting to 09 million  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2015  we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

contractual obligations and commitments   

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity our contractual obligations represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations with terms in excess of one year we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing cash balances 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2015  in thousands 

 

1 includes interest and land lease 

the contractual obligation table above excludes tax liabilities of 143 million related to uncertain tax positions because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement if any of these future payments 

critical accounting policies and estimates   

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods we base our estimates assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements which in turn could change the results from those reported we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis the critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are the following 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from sales of switching products which incorporate our eos software and accessories such as cables and optics to direct customers and channel partners together with post contract customer support “pcs” we typically sell products and pcs in a single transaction we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery or performance has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

we define each of the four criteria above as follows 

 pcs is offered under renewable feebased contracts which includes technical support hardware repair and replacement parts beyond standard warranty bug fixes patches and unspecified upgrades on a whenandifavailable basis we initially defer pcs revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the pcs contract with the related expenses recognized as incurred pcs contracts usually have a term of one  to three  years we include billed but unearned pcs revenue in deferred revenue 

we report revenue net of sales taxes we include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold 

multipleelement arrangements 

most of our arrangements other than renewals of pcs are multiple element arrangements with a combination of products and pcs products and pcs generally qualify as separate units of accounting our hardware deliverables include eos software which together deliver the essential functionality of our products for multiple element arrangements we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price the relative selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy vendorspecific 

objective evidence “vsoe” if available thirdparty evidence “tpe” if vsoe is not available and best estimate of selling price “besp” if neither vsoe nor tpe is available as we have not been able to establish vsoe or tpe for our products and most of our services we generally utilize besp for the purposes of allocating revenue to each unit of accounting 

   

 we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services future performance obligations or subject to customerspecific return acceptance or refund privileges 

we account for multiple agreements with a single partner as 1  arrangement if the contractual terms andor substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are in effect parts of a single arrangement 

we may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is no contractual provision for such returns we estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied against currentperiod gross revenues specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate 

inventory valuation and contract manufacturersupplier liabilities 

inventories primarily consist of finished goods purchased from third party contract manufacturers and are stated at the lower of cost computed using the firstin firstout method or market value manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory in addition we purchase strategic component inventory from certain suppliers under purchase commitments that in some cases are noncancelable including integrated circuits which are held by our contract manufacturers we record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value we also record a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our component inventory suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete 

our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts we generally incur a liability when the contract manufacturer has converted the component inventory to a finished product historically we have reimbursed our contract manufacturer for component inventory that has been rendered excess or obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes or in cases where inventory levels greatly exceed our forecasts 

we use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures these estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers product development plans and current sales levels if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory writedowns and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities 

warranty 

we offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90 day warranty against defects in the software embedded in the products we use judgment and estimates when determining warranty costs based on historical costs to replace product returns within the warranty period at the time we recognize revenue we accrue for potential warranty claims at the time of shipment as a component of cost of revenues based on historical experience and other relevant information we reserve for specifically identified products if and when we determine we have a systemic product failure although we engage in extensive product quality programs if actual product failure rates or use of materials differ from estimates additional warranty costs may be incurred which could reduce our gross margin the accrued warranty liability is recorded in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

stockbased compensation 

compensation expense related to stockbased transactions including stock options restricted stock units rsus restricted 

stock awards “rsas” and stock purchase rights under our employee stock purchase program is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity granted stockbased compensation expense is generally recognized on a straightline basis net of estimated forfeitures over the requisite service periods of the awards which typically ranges from two  to five  years the assumptions used in our optionpricing model represent management’s best estimates these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and different assumptions are used our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future these assumptions and estimates are as follows 

fair value of common stock 

the fair value of each stockbased award and option is estimated on the grant date using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model this model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the expected term of the option the expected volatility of the price of our common stock riskfree interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock rsus are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant prior to our initial public offering we estimated the fair value of common stock based on numerous subjective and objective factors at each grant date 

expected term 

the expected term represents the period that our equity grants are expected to be outstanding for option grants that are considered to be “simple” we used the simplified method to determine the expected term which calculates the expected term as the average of the timetovesting and the contractual life of the options for option grants that are not considered “simple” the expected term is based on historical option exercise behavior and postvesting cancellations of options by employees for espp grants the expected term is based on the length of the offering period which is typically 24 months 

expected volatility 

the volatility is derived from the average historical stock volatilities of a peer group of public companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stockbased grants we intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us in which case more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation 

riskfree interest rate 

the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zerocoupon us treasury notes with maturities approximately equal or equivalent to the option’s remaining expected term 

dividend yield 

the expected dividend assumption is based on our current expectations about our anticipated dividend policy we have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future consequently we used an expected dividend yield of zero 

in addition to the assumptions used above we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stockbased compensation expense for our awards our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures we continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover and other factors changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stockbased compensation on a prospective basis as we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock we may refine our estimates which could materially impact our future stockbased compensation expense 

income taxes 

income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that we recognize for financial reporting and income tax purposes 

we account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements but have not been reflected in our taxable income estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize 

we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

we regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized we recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether and to the extent to which additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense 

loss contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are a party to claims and legal proceedings including matters relating to commercial employee relations business practices and intellectual property in assessing loss contingencies we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss we record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated we will record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 

recent accounting pronouncements 

refer to “recent accounting pronouncements” in note 1 to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and investments in privately held companies 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located which is primarily in the us and to a lesser extent in europe and asia our results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates the effect of an immediate 10 adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at december 31 2015 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations to date foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements while we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 

interest rate sensitivity 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and availableforsale marketable securities our cash and cash equivalents are held in cash deposits money market funds with maturities of less than 90 days from the date of purchase our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the us however because of the conservative and shortterm nature of the instruments in our portfolio a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2015 we had no investments in availableforsale marketable securities the effect of an immediate 10 change in interest rates at december 31 2015 would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 

investments in privately held companies 

we have invested in privately held companies in 2014 these investments are recorded in investments noncurrent in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using the cost method as of december 31 2015 the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was 336 million some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

management with the participation of our chief executive officer ceo and our chief financial officer cfo evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2015 the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2015 our ceo and cfo concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission sec rules and forms and that 

such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

changes in internal control over financial reporting   

we have remediated the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the inadequate design and operation of review controls over the cash flow statement by implementing a number of measures designed to address the underlying causes of the material weakness our remediation included implementation of additional procedures surrounding the precision and accuracy of the review control over our statement of cash flows including enhancement and segregation of duties within our accounting and finance department in addition we improved and expanded our internal review procedures during our financial statement close process we believe that these additional processes and procedures have enabled us to broaden the scope and quality of our controls related to the oversight and review of our financial statements 

except for the remediation efforts related to the controls over the cash flow statement described above there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by rule 13a15d and 15d15d of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended that occurred during the year ended december 31 2015 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations of internal controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due   to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

industry background 

cloud computing is fundamentally changing the way it infrastructure is built and how applications are delivered in cloud computing applications are distributed across thousands of servers these servers are connected with highspeed network switches that together form a pool of resources that allows applications to be rapidly deployed and costeffectively updated cloud computing enables ubiquitous and ondemand network access to these applications from internetconnected devices including personal computers tablets and smartphones 

nearly all consumer applications today are delivered as cloud services enterprise applications are rapidly moving to the cloud as well since cloud services are easier and more cost effective to deploy scale and operate than traditional applications internet leaders like amazon ebay facebook google microsoft and yahoo pioneered the development of largescale cloud data centers in order to meet the growing demands of their users including business customers enterprises and service providers around the world are adopting cloud computing technologies in order to achieve similar performance improvements and cost reductions 

the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can be orders of magnitude higher than typical legacy data center networks therefore the networks in such cloud environments must be architected and built in a new way we refer to these nextgeneration data center networks as cloud networks cloud networks must deliver high capacity high availability and predictable performance and must be programmable to allow integration with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services 

limitations of traditional data center networks 

in our view cloud networks and legacy networks are fundamentally different in a traditional data center specific applications are installed on a small number of servers and most network traffic is servertoclient or “northsouth” traffic which results in perhaps a few terabitssecond of aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud most network traffic is servertoserver or “eastwest” traffic the aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can exceed 1 petabitsecond orders of magnitude higher than that of typical legacy data center networks 

the much larger scale of cloud networks requires much higher network availability since network outages in the cloud are very expensive in terms of customer impact traditional network switches have evolved and the features and capabilities of their operating system have expanded over many years without addressing the structural deficiencies of their underlying software architectures making it difficult to achieve high network switch reliability 

some networking vendors have built products that use proprietary protocols to address the scaling needs of nextgeneration data centers however proprietary protocols are generally not acceptable to internet companies or cloud service providers because they create vendor lockin 

legacy networks are not programmable and as a result are extremely difficult to integrate with thirdparty applications for network management automation orchestration and network services this lack of integration forces customers to continue to rely on time consuming errorprone manual processes that may be costprohibitive 

requirements for cloud networking 

cloud networks differ in many aspects from legacy networks including capacity performance scale availability programmability automation visibility and cost performance the requirements for cloud networking include the following

 our cloud networking solutions 

we are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration enterprise data centers our cloud networking platform was purposebuilt to address the functional and performance requirements for cloud networks we deliver our solutions via our industryleading 1040100 gigabit ethernet switches optimized for nextgeneration data center networks 

our cloud networking solutions consist of eos our extensible operating system a set of networking applications and our 1040100 gigabit ethernet switches at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos eos was architected to be fully programmable and highly modular 

as illustrated below the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications and application programming interfaces or apis that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has further allowed us to integrate rapidly with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services 

the key benefits of our cloud networking solutions are as follows 

capacity performance and scalability 

our cloud networking platform enables data center networks to scale to hundreds of thousands of physical servers and millions of virtual machines with the least number of switching tiers we achieve this by leveraging standard protocols to meet the scale requirements of cloud computing we have used activeactive layer 2 and layer 3 network topologies to enable customers to build extremely large and resilient networks 

high availability 

our highly modular eos software architecture was designed to be faultisolating and selfhealing in order to deliver higher stability compared to legacy network operating systems in addition our customers can nondisruptively upgrade our switches running in the network using our smart system upgrade or ssu application 

open and programmable 

our eos software was purposebuilt to offer programmable interfaces throughout all levels of our software this has allowed us to integrate our cloud networking platform with a wide range of leading thirdparty applications for example we support vmware nsx openstack and microsoft system center for orchestration and fast provisioning enabling true workload mobility and automatic provisioning of physical switches we enable customers through application programming interfaces to write their own scripts to customize and optimize their networks in addition we support a wide range of softwaredefined network controllers via our openflow and directflow interfaces 

workflow automation 

our eos software enables enterprises to provision networking resources in minutes with no manual intervention through our zero touch provisioning we also natively support ansible cfengine chef puppet virtual network orchestration applications and thirdparty management tools finally eos embraces the devops model which is a software development method that combines development and operations to provision and monitor servers storage and network resources in a unified fashion 

  

network visibility 

our eos software provides a set of tools and applications that proactively monitor detect and notify network managers when network issues arise delivering realtime data to thirdparty management applications including corvil extrahop riverbed and splunk to provide detailed application visibility our telemetry applications include vm tracer which provides visibility down to the virtual machine level path tracer which detects errors in provisioned network paths mapreduce tracer which monitors and optimizes the performance of hadoop workloads and health tracer which monitors infrastructure resiliency our network visibility applications provide realtime insight into the status of the network they include lanz which monitors latency and danz which provides advanced traffic monitoring with flow analysis and timestamps plus the ability to perform tap aggregation for reporting and analysis 

lower total cost of ownership 

our cloud networking platform offers architectural and system advantages that provide our customers with costeffective and highly available cloud networking solutions our programmable scalable leafspine architectures combined with industryleading applications significantly reduce networking costs when compared to legacy network designs enabling faster time to service and improved availability our automation tools reduce the operational costs of provisioning managing and monitoring a data center network and speed up service delivery our visibility tools provide high levels of visibility into complex network environments without the need for additional data collection equipment as a result fewer network engineers are needed to operate large networks 

our market opportunity 

we compete primarily in the data center switching market for 10 gigabit ethernet and above excluding blade switches 

we believe that cloud computing represents a fundamental shift from traditional legacy data centers and that cloud networking is the fastest growing segment within the data center switching market as organizations of all sizes are adopting cloud architectures spending on cloud and nextgeneration data centers has increased rapidly over the last several years while traditional legacy it spending has been growing more slowly 

our customers 

as of december 31 2014  we had delivered our cloud networking solutions to approximately 3000 end customers worldwide in over 70 countries our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others our customers include six of the largest cloud service providers based on annual revenue including ebay facebook microsoft and yahoo financial services organizations such as barclays citigroup and morgan stanley and a number of media and service providers including aol comcast equinix espn netflix and rackspace for each of the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 microsoft purchases through our channel partner world wide technology inc accounted for more than 10 of our total revenue 

our competitive strengths 

we believe the following strengths will allow us to maintain and extend our technology leadership position in cloud networking and nextgeneration data center ethernet switching 

  

 7 

microsystems and from 1996 to 2003 served as vpgm of the gigabit systems business unit at cisco kenneth duda our founder chief technology officer and svp software engineering led the software development effort of the gigabit systems business unit at cisco from 1996 to 2000 

 our growth strategy 

we intend to grow our revenue and market share in cloud and nextgeneration data center ethernet switching key elements of our growth strategy include 

  

 our products and technology 

we offer one of the broadest product lines of data center 1040100 gigabit ethernet switches in the industry comprising our 7050 series and 7150 series topofrack switches our 72xx7300 x series spline switches and our 7280 and 7500 e series spine switches 

we deliver switches with industryleading capacity low latency port density and power efficiency we have also innovated in areas such as deep packet buffers embedded optics and reversible cooling our products have been recognized with a number of awards including the best of interop grand prize that was given to our industryleading spine switch the arista 7500 series in 2010 and again to the arista 7500e series in 2013 an overview of our switching portfolio is shown in the figure below 

we use multiple silicon architectures across our products which allows us to build a broader range of switching products optimized for different functions in the network than competitors that utilize fewer silicon architectures while we use multiple silicon architectures all of our switches are powered with the same binary eos image which significantly simplifies deployment and ensures the same rich feature set and consistent operation across all our products 

our extensible operating system 

the core of our cloud networking platform is our extensible operating system or eos which runs on top of standard linux and offers programmability at all layers of the stack all of our 1040100 gigabit ethernet switches run our eos software 

eos is based on a new and innovative architecture that cleanly separates protocol processing from system state our eos software is highly modular and consists of more than 100 separate processes that we call agents each one handling specific protocol processing device driver or system management functions each agent runs in user space as a separate linux process and is completely protected and isolated from all other agents communication between agents only occurs through a central inmemory database called sysdb which provides a central repository for all system state any update posted by an agent to sysdb is automatically forwarded to 

all other processes that need to be notified of such an update to perform the appropriate processing the exchange of state through a central state repository is far more reliable than the conventional approach of direct interprocess communication between a large number of processes 

as illustrated below all agents are isolated from each other and interact directly through sysdb thereby ensuring fault containment and availability 

eos attributes 

the modular and programmable architecture of eos enables us to offer a set of attributes capabilities and features that are essential for cloud networking and nextgeneration data centers 

high availability 

eos is selfhealing in the sense that individual processes can be restarted without impacting application traffic the same attribute allows inservice software upgrades of individual eos processes the capability to recover from software faults and upgrade processes in a running system is not available in legacy network operating systems 

programmable at all layers 

eos is programmable at all layers from the linux kernel to switch configuration provisioning automation and detailed monitoring of the network we support the following application programming interfaces or apis 

  

 in addition we support full access to linux and support standard linux tools such as ping tcpdump ganglia and nagios as well as customized shell python and perl scripts and native c programs 

complete network visibility 

through eos we have developed a wide range of applications available to our customers for purchase as additional licenses that enable enhanced network monitoring and visibility without requiring additional external monitoring devices including the following 

  

 10 

 network automation 

eos supports puppet chef and ansible which enables automatic network configuration in the same manner as servers and storage in addition eos provides two tools that greatly reduce network operational costs 

  

 leafspine network designs 

our customers typically deploy leafspine network topologies consisting of leaf switches or topofrack switches located in the server rack connected with uplinks to multiple loadsharing spine switches that provide the backbone our leafspine network designs scale up to more than 300000 physical servers and millions of virtual machines using equal cost multiple pathing or ecmp to load balance layer 3 network traffic across multiple spine switches with multichassis link aggregation or mlag we can build an activeactive layer 2 network that can connect more than 25000 physical servers examples of our leafspine mlag and ecmp architectures are illustrated below 

our leafspine network designs have been widely deployed and provide predictable network bandwidth and latency a key advantage of predictable network performance is that it eliminates the need to optimize the network for specific applications which means a single network design works equally well for all applications 

customer support and services 

we have designed our customer support offerings to provide our customers with high levels of support our global team of support engineers engages directly with client it teams and is available at all times over email by phone or through our website 

we offer multiple service options that allow our customers to select the product replacement service level that best meets their needs we stock spare parts in over 95 locations around the world through our thirdparty logistics suppliers all of our service options include unlimited access to bugfixes new featurereleases online case management and our community forums 

sales and marketing 

we market and sell our products through our direct sales force and in partnership with our channel partners including distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators and oem partners we also sell in conjunction with various technology partners to facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity we have created a partner program the arista partner program to engage partners who provide valueadded services and extend our reach into the marketplace authorized training partners perform technical training of our channel partners and end customers our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us 

our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for presales technical support and solutions engineering for our end customers systems integrators original equipment manufacturers or oems and channel partners a pool of shared channel sales and marketing representatives also supports these teams each sales team is responsible for a 

geographical territory has responsibility for a number of major direct endcustomer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market we have field sales teams operating in 24 countries during 2014 and 2013 797 and 829 of our revenue was generated from the americas substantially all from the us 128 and 112 from europe the middle east and africa and 75 and 59 from the asiapacific region respectively 

our marketing activities consist primarily of technology conferences web marketing trade shows product demonstrations seminars and events public relations analyst relations demand generation and direct marketing to build our brand increase endcustomer awareness communicate our product advantages and generate qualified leads for our field sales force and channel partners 

research and development 

we believe our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and features that address the needs of our end customers our inhouse engineering personnel are responsible for the development quality documentation support and release of our products we plan to continue to invest significantly in resources to conduct our research and development efforts 

manufacturing 

we subcontract the manufacturing of all of our products to various contract manufacturers our primary manufacturing partners are jabil circuit and foxconn we also work with flextronics international ltd to provide logistics and final configuration services in north america this approach allows us to reduce our costs manufacturing overhead and inventory position and allows us to adjust more quickly to changing endcustomer demand we require all of our manufacturing locations to be iso9001 certified our eos software is installed on our products at one of three direct fulfillment facilities 

our contract manufacturing partners procure the majority of the components needed to build our products and assemble our products according to our design specifications this allows us to leverage the purchasing power of our contract manufacturing partners we retain complete control over the bill of material test procedures and quality assurance programs our onsite personnel work closely with our partners and review on an ongoing basis forecasts inventory levels processes capacity yields and overall quality our contract manufacturing partners procure components and assemble our products based on our demand forecasts these forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analyses from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions we update these forecasts monthly 

our products rely on key components including merchant silicon integrated circuit components and power supplies purchased from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers generally neither our contract manufacturers nor we have a written agreement with any of these component providers to guarantee the supply of the key components used in our products nor do we have exclusive rights to such key components our product development efforts also depend upon continued collaboration with our key suppliers including our merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors it is critical that we work in tandem with our key merchant silicon vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features this enables us to focus our research and development resources on software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions 

once the completed products are manufactured and tested our contract manufacturing partners ship them to various theatre direct fulfillment facilities in california the netherlands and singapore for final configuration quality control inspection and shipment to our distribution partners and end customers after the products are shipped to our end customers our products are installed by the end customers or by thirdparty service providers such as system integrators or value added resellers on their behalf 

backlog 

we do not have any longterm purchase commitments from customers customers generally order products on an asneeded basis with short lead and delivery times on a perpurchaseorder basis we maintain substantial finished goods inventory to ensure that products can generally be shipped shortly after receipt of an order a significant portion of our customer shipments in any fiscal year relate to orders received and shipped in that fiscal year resulting in low product backlog relative to total shipments because our customers utilize purchase orders containing nonbinding purchase commitments and we allow customers to cancel change or reschedule orders without penalty at any time prior to shipment we also do not believe backlog is firm as a result of the foregoing factors backlog is not material and not a meaningful indicator in any given period of our ability to achieve any particular level of overall revenue or financial performance 

competition 

the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology changing endcustomer needs evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products and services we expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for cloud networking expands and existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products 

the data center networking market has been historically dominated by cisco systems with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including brocade communications systems dell hewlettpackard and juniper networks 

we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants including “whitebox” switch vendors as well as current technology partners and end customers who may develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products 

the principle competitive factors applicable to our products include 

  

 we believe our products compete favorably with respect to these factors our eos software offers high reliability integrates with existing network protocols and is open and programmable we believe the combination of eos a set of network applications and our 1040100 gigabit ethernet switch makes our offering highly competitive for both cloud and enterprise data centers however many of our competitors have greater name recognition longer operating histories larger sales and marketing budgets and resources broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners and end customers greater access to larger endcustomer bases greater endcustomer support resources greater manufacturing resources the ability to leverage their sales efforts across a broader portfolio of products the ability to leverage purchasing power when purchasing subcomponents the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services the ability to develop their own silicon chips the ability to set more aggressive pricing policies lower labor and development costs greater resources to make acquisitions larger intellectual property portfolios and substantially greater financial technical research and development or other resources 

intellectual property 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our core technology and intellectual property we rely on patent trademark and copyright laws trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with our employees end customers resellers systems integrators and others to protect our intellectual property rights as of december 31 2014 we had 39 patent applications pending in the us and two patents granted in the us which expire in 2025 and 2028 

we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of valuable breadth or applicability in addition any patents that may be issued may be contested circumvented found unenforceable or invalidated and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them we also license software from third parties for integration into our products including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms we also own a number of trademarks in the us and other jurisdictions including arista which mark is not registered in the us eos cloudvision health tracer mapreduce tracer path tracer mxp rail and spline 

we control access to and use of our software technology and other proprietary information through internal and external controls including contractual protections with employees contractors end customers and partners our software is protected by us and international copyright patent and trade secret laws despite our efforts to protect our software technology and other proprietary information unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software technology and other proprietary information in addition we intend to expand our international operations and effective patent copyright trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries 

our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights if we become more successful we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights it may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights in particular large and established companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation from time to time third parties including certain of these large companies and nonpracticing entities may assert patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property rights against us our channel partners or our end customers whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against such claims for example in december 2014 cisco systems filed two lawsuits against us in the northern district of california for alleged patent and copyright infringement additionally cisco systems filed to complaints against us in the international trade commission itc for patent infringement and the itc has initiated an investigation please see legal proceedings included in part i item 3 of this annual report on form 10k for a description of this litigation successful claims of infringement by a third party if any could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services require us to expend time and money to develop noninfringing solutions or force us to pay substantial damages royalties or other fees we cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe or that we will not in the future infringe upon any thirdparty patents or other proprietary rights 

employees

 item 1a risk factors 

you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information in this annual report on form 10k which could materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the risks described below are not the only risks facing us risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

risks related to our business and our industry 

our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and may increase the risk associated with your investment 

we were founded in 2004 and shipped our first products in 2008 the majority of our revenue growth has occurred since the beginning of 2010 our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects including our ability to plan for and model future growth we have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by rapidly growing companies in constantly evolving industries including the risks described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k if we do not address these risks successfully our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline further we have limited historical financial data and we operate in a rapidly evolving market as such any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market 

our business and operations have experienced rapid growth and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth or are unable to improve our systems and processes our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected 

we have experienced rapid growth and increased demand for our products over the last several years which has placed a strain on our management administrative operational and financial infrastructure our employee headcount and number of end customers have increased significantly to handle the increase in end customers we expect to continue to grow our headcount significantly over the next 12 months for example as of december 31 2010 and december 31 2014  our cumulative number of end customers increased from approximately 570 to over 3000 as we have grown we have had to manage an increasingly larger and more complex array of internal systems and processes to scale with all aspects of our business including our hardware and software development contract manufacturing and purchasing logistics and fulfillment and maintenance and support our success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our growth effectively to do so we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and continue to hire train and manage new employees as needed to manage domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational financial and management controls and our reporting processes and procedures and implement more extensive and integrated financial and business information systems we may not be able to successfully implement these or other improvements to our systems and processes in an efficient or timely manner and we may discover deficiencies in their capabilities or effectiveness we may experience difficulties in managing improvements to our systems and processes or in connection with thirdparty technology in addition our systems and processes may not prevent or detect all errors omissions or fraud our failure to improve our systems and processes or their failure to operate effectively and in the intended manner may result in disruption of our current operations and endcustomer relationships our inability to manage the growth of our business and our inability to accurately forecast our revenue expenses and earnings and prevent certain losses 

our results of operations are likely to vary significantly from period to period and be unpredictable and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors or our previously issued financial guidance or if any forwardlooking financial guidance does not meet the expectation of analysts or investors the market price of our common stock could decline substantially 

our results of operations have historically varied from period to period and we expect that this trend will continue as a result you should not rely upon our past financial results for any period as indicators of future performance our results of operations in any given period can be influenced by a number of factors many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict including 

 15 

 any one of the factors above or the cumulative effect of several of the factors described above may result in significant fluctuations in our financial and other results of operations this variability and unpredictability could result in our failure to meet our revenue gross margins results of operations or other expectations contained in any forward looking financial guidance we have issued or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for a particular period if we fail to meet or exceed such guidance or expectations for these or any other reasons the market price of our common stock could decline substantially and we could face costly lawsuits including securities class action suits 

we expect large purchases by a limited number of end customers to continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue and any loss or delay of expected purchases could result in material quartertoquarter fluctuations of our revenue or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for significant portion of our revenue many of these end customers make large purchases to complete or upgrade specific data center installations and are typically made on a purchaseorder basis rather than pursuant to longterm contracts revenue from sales to microsoft through our channel partner world wide technology inc accounted for 149 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  219 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 and 153 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 

as a consequence of the concentrated nature of our customer base and their purchasing behavior our quarterly revenue and results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to estimate for example any cancellation of orders or any acceleration or delay in anticipated product purchases or the acceptance of shipped products by our larger end customers could materially affect our revenue and results of operations in any quarterly period we may be unable to sustain or increase our revenue from our large end customers or offset the discontinuation of concentrated purchases by our larger end customers with purchases by new or existing end customers we expect that such concentrated purchases will continue to contribute materially to our revenue for the foreseeable future and that our results of operations may fluctuate materially as a result of such larger end customers’ buying patterns in addition we may see consolidation of our customer base such as among internet companies and cloud service providers which could result in loss of end customers the loss of such end customers or a significant delay or reduction in their purchases could materially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance 

our revenue growth rate in recent periods may not be indicative of our future performance we experienced annual revenue growth rates of 617  868 and 383 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we may not achieve similar revenue growth rates in future periods especially as we enter and expand into the cloud services and application services provider markets you should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual period as any indication of our future revenue or revenue growth if we are unable to maintain consistent revenue or revenue growth our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

we face intense competition especially from larger wellestablished companies and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position 

the market for data center networking including the market for cloud networking is intensely competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future from established competitors and new market entrants this competition could result in increased pricing pressure reduced profit margins increased sales and marketing expenses and our failure to increase or the loss of market share any of which would likely seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

the data center networking market has been historically dominated by cisco systems with competition also coming from other large network equipment and system vendors including juniper networks brocade communications systems hewlettpackard and dell we also face competition from other companies and new market entrants including “whitebox” switch vendors as well as current technology partners and end customers many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as 

 our competitors also may be able to provide end customers with capabilities or benefits different from or greater than those we can provide in areas such as technical qualifications or geographic presence or may be able to provide end customers a broader range of products services and prices in addition large competitors may have more extensive relationships with and within existing and potential end customers that provide them with an advantage in competing for business with those end customers for example certain large competitors encourage end customers of their other products and services to adopt their data networking solutions through discounted bundled product packages our ability to compete will depend upon our ability to provide a better solution than our competitors at a more competitive price we may be required to make substantial additional investments in research development marketing and sales in order to respond to competition and we cannot assure you that these investments will achieve any returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future 

we also expect increased competition if our market continues to expand conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or other factors current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties that have greater resources available than we do our current or potential competitors might take advantage of the greater resources of the larger organization resulting from these acquisitions to compete more vigorously or broadly with us in addition continued industry consolidation might adversely affect end customers’ perceptions of the viability of smaller and even mediumsized networking companies and consequently end customers’ willingness to purchase from those companies further certain large end customers may develop network switches and cloud service solutions for internal use andor to broaden their portfolio of products which could allow these end customers to become new competitors in the market 

if we do not successfully anticipate technological shifts market needs and opportunities and develop products and product enhancements that meet those technological shifts needs and opportunities or if those products are not made available in a timely manner or do not gain market acceptance we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

the cloud networking market can be characterized by rapid technological shifts and increasingly complex endcustomer requirements to achieve scalable and more programmable networks that facilitate virtualization big data publicprivate cloud and web scale computing we must continue to develop new technologies and products that address emerging technological trends and changing endcustomer needs the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain and new offerings requires significant upfront investment that may not result in material design improvements to existing products or result in marketable new products or costs savings or revenue for an extended period of time if at all the success of new products depends on several factors including appropriate new product definition component costs timely completion and introduction of these products differentiation of new products from those of our competitors and market acceptance of these products 

in addition new technologies could render our existing products obsolete or less attractive to end customers and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected if such technologies are widely adopted for example end customers may prefer to address their network switch requirements by licensing software operating systems separately 

and placing them on industrystandard servers or develop their own networking products rather than purchasing integrated hardware products as has occurred in the server industry 

we may not be able to successfully anticipate or adapt to changing technology or endcustomer requirements on a timely basis or at all if we fail to keep up with technology changes or to convince our end customers and potential end customers of the value of our solutions even in light of new technologies our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

we are currently involved in litigation with cisco systems inc 

on december 5 2014 cisco filed two complaints against us in district court for the northern district of california which are proceeding as case no 414cv0543 “’043 case” and case no 414cv0544 “’044 case” in the ’043 case cisco alleges that we infringe us patent nos 6377577 6741592 7023853 7061875 7162537 7200145 7224668 7290164 7340597 7460492 8051211 and 8356296 respectively “the ’577 patent” “the ’592 patent” “the ’853 patent” “the 875 patent” “the ’537 patent” “the ’145 patent” “the ’668 patent” “the ’164 patent” “the ’597 patent” “the ’492 patent” “the ’211 patent” and “the ’296 patent” cisco seeks as relief for our alleged infringement in the ’043 case lost profits andor reasonable royalty damages in an unspecified amount including treble damages attorney’s fees and associated costs cisco also seeks injunctive relief in the ’043 case on february 10 2015 the court granted our unopposed motion to stay the ’043 case until the proceedings before the united states international trade commission “usitc” pertaining to the same patents as discussed below become final in the ’044 case cisco’s complaint alleges that we infringe us patent nos 7047526 and 7953886 and further alleges that we infringe numerous copyrights pertaining to cisco’s “command line interface” or “cli” as relief for our alleged patent infringement in the ’044 case cisco seeks lost profits andor reasonable royalty damages in an unspecified amount including treble damages attorney’s fees and associated costs as well as injunctive relief as relief from our alleged copyright infringement cisco seeks damages in an unspecified amount in the form of alleged lost profits profits from our alleged infringement statutory damages attorney’s fees and associated costs cisco also seeks injunctive relief against our alleged copyright infringement on february 13 2015 we answered the complaint in the ’044 case denying the patent and copyright infringement allegations and also raising numerous affirmative defenses trial has not been scheduled in either the ’043 or ’044 cases 

on december 19 2014 cisco filed two complaints against us in the usitc alleging that arista has violated section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 as amended the complaints have been instituted as itc inv nos 337ta944 “’944 investigation” and 337ta945 “’945 investigation in the ’944 investigation cisco alleges that certain arista switching products infringe the ’592 ’537 ’145 ’164 ’597 and ’296 patents in the ’945 investigation cisco alleges that certain arista switching products infringe the ’577 ’853 ’875 ’668 ’492 and ’211 patents in both the ’944 and ’945 investigations cisco seeks among other things a limited exclusion order barring entry into the united states of accused switch products including 7000 series of switches and a cease and desist order against us regarding our accused switch products on january 28 2015 the administrative law judge assigned to the ’944 investigation set may 27 2016 as the target date for completion of the ’944 investigation on february 11 2015 we responded to the notices of investigation and complaints in the ’944 and ’945 investigations by among other things denying the patent infringement allegations and raising numerous affirmative defenses on february 19 2015 the administrative law judge assigned to the ’945 investigation issued a procedural schedule calling for among other events issuance of an order construing the claims of the ’577 ’853 ’875 ’668 ’492 and ’211 patents tentatively on july 17 2015 an evidentiary hearing on november 920 2015 an initial determination regarding our alleged violations due april 26 2016 and the target date for completion of the ’945 investigation on august 26 2016 

we intend to vigorously defend against cisco’s lawsuits as summarized in the preceding paragraphs however we cannot be certain that if litigated any claims by cisco would be resolved in our favor for example an adverse litigation ruling could result in a significant damages award against us could further result in the above described injunctive relief including among other things an order excluding our products from importation into the united states could result in a requirement that we make substantial royalty payments to cisco andor could require that we modify our products to the extent that we are found to infringe any valid claims asserted against us cisco any such adverse ruling could materially adversely affect our business prospects results of operation and financial condition to the extent that we reached a negotiated settlement with cisco the settlement could require payment of substantial royalties 

additionally the existence of this lawsuit could cause concern among our customers and potential customers and could adversely affect our business and results of operations an adverse litigation ruling could also result in a significant damages award against us and the injunctive relief described above many of our customers and channel partners require us to indemnify and defend them against third party infringement claims and pay damages in the case of adverse rulings these claims could harm our relationships with our customers or channel partners and might deter them from doing business with us in order to maintain our relationships with existing customers and secure business with new customers we may be required from time to time to provide additional assurances beyond our standard terms whether or not we prevail in the lawsuit we expect that the litigation will be expensive timeconsuming and a distraction to management in operating our business 

we are currently involved in a license dispute with optumsoft inc 

on april 4 2014 optumsoft filed a lawsuit against us in the superior court of california santa clara county titled optumsoft inc v arista networks inc in which it asserts i ownership of certain components of our eos network operating system pursuant to the terms of a 2004 agreement between the companies and ii breaches of certain confidentiality and use restrictions in that agreement under the terms of the 2004 agreement optumsoft provided us with a nonexclusive irrevocable royaltyfree license to software delivered by optumsoft comprising a software tool used to develop certain components of eos and a runtime library that is incorporated into eos the 2004 agreement places certain restrictions on our use and disclosure of the optumsoft software and gives optumsoft ownership of improvements modifications and corrections to and derivative works of the optumsoft software that we develop in its lawsuit optumsoft has asked the court to order us to i give optumsoft copies of certain components of our software for evaluation by optumsoft ii cease all conduct constituting the alleged confidentiality and use restriction breaches iii secure the return or deletion of optumsoft’s alleged intellectual property provided to third parties including our customers iv assign ownership to optumsoft of optumsoft’s alleged intellectual property currently owned by us and v pay optumsoft’s alleged damages attorney’s fees and costs of the lawsuit david cheriton one of our founders and a former member of our board of directors who resigned from our board of directors on march 1 2014 and has no continuing role with us is a founder and we believe the largest stockholder and director of optumsoft the 2010 david r cheriton irrevocable trust dtd july 27 2010 a trust for the benefit of the minor children of mr cheriton is one of our largest stockholders 

optumsoft has identified in confidential documents certain software components it claims to own which are generally applicable tools and utility subroutines and not networking specific code we cannot assure which software components optumsoft may ultimately claim to own in the litigation or whether such claimed components are material the court set a trial date for phase i of the proceedings relating to contract interpretation and application of the contract to certain claimed source code for september 14 2015 the remaining issues are currently scheduled to be tried in april 2016 

we intend to vigorously defend against optumsoft’s lawsuit however we cannot be certain that if litigated any claims by optumsoft would be resolved in our favor for example if it were determined that optumsoft owned components of our eos network operating system we would be required to transfer ownership of those components and any related intellectual property to optumsoft if optumsoft were the owner of those components it could make them available to our competitors such as through a sale or license in addition optumsoft could assert additional or different claims against us including claims that our license from optumsoft is invalid 

additionally the existence of this lawsuit could cause concern among our customers and potential customers and could adversely affect our business and results of operations an adverse litigation ruling could also result in a significant damages award against us and the injunctive relief described above in addition if our license was ruled to have been terminated and we were not able to negotiate a new license from optumsoft on reasonable terms we could be required to pay substantial royalties to optumsoft or be prohibited from selling products that incorporate optumsoft intellectual property any such adverse ruling could materially adversely affect our business prospects results of operation and financial condition whether or not we prevail in the lawsuit we expect that the litigation will be expensive timeconsuming and a distraction to management in operating our business 

product quality problems defects errors or vulnerabilities in our products or services could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we produce highly complex products that incorporate advanced technologies including both hardware and software technologies despite testing prior to their release our products may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in analyzing correcting or redesigning the products cause us to lose significant end customers subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

from time to time we have had to replace certain components of products that we had shipped and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs including failures in software protocols or defective component batches resulting in reliability issues in such products and we may be required to do so in the future we may also be required to provide full replacements or refunds for such defective products we cannot assure you that such remediation would not have a material effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects please see “—our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects” 

the cloud networking market is still in its early stages and is rapidly evolving if this market does not evolve as we anticipate or our target end customers do not adopt our cloud networking solutions we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenue will suffer 

the cloud networking market is still in its early stages the market demand for cloud networking solutions has increased in recent years as end customers have deployed larger networks and have increased the use of virtualization and cloud computing our success depends upon our ability to provide cloud networking solutions that address the needs of end customers more effectively and economically than those of other competitors or existing technologies 

if the cloud networking solutions market does not develop in the way we anticipate if our solutions do not offer benefits compared to competing network switching products or if end customers do not recognize the benefits that our solutions provide then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources divert management’s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 

as a public company we are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act the listing requirements of the new york stock exchange and other applicable securities rules and regulations including the sarbanesoxley act and the doddfrank act compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs make some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act among other things the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard significant resources and management oversight may be required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects although we have already hired additional employees to help comply with these requirements we may need to further expand our legal and finance departments in the future which will increase our costs and expenses 

in addition changing laws regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming these laws regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity and as a result their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices we intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws regulations and standards and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenuegenerating activities to compliance activities if our efforts to comply with new laws regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business and prospects may be harmed as a result of disclosure of information in the filings required of a public company our business and financial condition will become more visible which may result in threatened or actual litigation including by competitors and other third parties if such claims are successful our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be harmed and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor these claims and the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert the resources of our management and harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we also expect that being a public company and these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee 

in addition as a result of our disclosure obligations as a public company we will have reduced strategic flexibility and will be under pressure to focus on shortterm results which may adversely affect our ability to achieve longterm profitability 

we are an “emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors 

for so long as we remain an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our registration statements periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company we would cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest to occur of i the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering ii the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenue is 1 billion or more iii the date on which we have during the previous threeyear period issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt securities or iv as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by nonaffiliates exceeded 700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year and have been subject to the requirements of the exchange act for at least 12 months 

in addition section 107 of the jobs act also provides that an “emerging growth company” may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards however we have chosen to “opt out” of such extended transition period and as a result we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for nonemerging growth companies our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable 

we are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting we may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner or our internal control over financial reporting may not be determined to be effective which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and as a result the value of our common stock 

as a public company we will be required pursuant to the exchange act to furnish a report by management on among other things the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending december 31 2015 this assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting we will be required to disclose changes made in our internal control and procedures on a quarterly basis our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the sec or the date we are no longer an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act at such time our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event that such firm is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented designed or operating as a result we may need to undertake various actions such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring accounting or internal audit staff in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for 2010 to 2013 we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which was remediated in 2014 however we cannot be certain that any control remediation efforts undertaken during 2015 will enable us to avoid a material weakness in the future ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to help produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and timeconsuming effort that needs to be evaluated frequently 

we are currently evaluating our internal control over financial reporting identifying and remediating deficiencies in internal controls and documenting the results of our evaluation testing and remediation we may not be able to complete our evaluation testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion during the evaluation and testing process if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that we are unable to remediate before the end of the same fiscal year in which the material weakness is identified we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or determine we have a material weakness in our internal controls we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports which would cause the price of our common stock to decline 

in the event that our chief executive officer chief financial officer or independent registered public accounting firm determines in the future that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 we could be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs pay fines settlements or judgments and causing investor perceptions to be adversely affected and potentially resulting in a decline in the market price of our stock 

if we are unable to attract new large end customers or to sell additional products to our existing end customers our revenue growth will be adversely affected and our revenue could decrease 

to increase our revenue we must add new end customers and large end customers and sell additional products to existing end customers for example one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our solutions thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers we believe this opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing infrastructure and expected future spend if we fail to attract new large end customers or sell additional products to our existing end customers our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

some of our large end customers require more favorable terms and conditions from their vendors and may request price concessions as we seek to sell more products to these end customers we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that may have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenue 

our large end customers have significant purchasing power and as a result may receive more favorable terms and conditions than we typically provide to other end customers including lower prices bundled upgrades extended warranties acceptance terms indemnification terms and extended return policies and other contractual rights as we seek to sell more products to these large end customers an increased mix of our shipments may be subject to such terms and conditions which may reduce our margins or affect the timing of our revenue recognition and thus may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

reliance on shipments at the end of the quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels 

as a result of endcustomer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the second half of each quarter this places significant pressure on order review and processing supply chain management manufacturing inventory and quality control management shipping and trade compliance to ensure that we have properly forecasted supply purchasing manufacturing capacity inventory and quality compliance and logistics if there is any significant interruption in these critical functions it could result in delayed order fulfillment adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and result in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

we base our inventory requirements on our forecasts of future sales if these forecasts are materially inaccurate we may procure inventory that we may be unable to use in a timely manner or at all 

we and our contract manufacturers procure components and build our products based on our forecasts these forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for our products which are in turn based on historical trends and analyses from our sales and marketing organizations adjusted for overall market conditions to the extent our forecasts are materially inaccurate or if we otherwise do not need such inventory we may under or overprocure inventory and such inaccuracies in our forecasts could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

managing the supply of our products and product components is complex insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins 

managing the supply of our products and product components is complex and our inventory management systems and related supplychain visibility tools may not enable us to forecast accurately and manage effectively the supply of our products and product components insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue while excess inventory may harm our gross margins in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and plan for adequate component supply from time to time we may issue purchase orders for components and products that are noncancelable and nonreturnable we establish a liability for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments with our thirdparty contract manufacturers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or obsolete material charges 

supply management remains an increased area of focus as we balance the need to maintain sufficient supply levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of obsolescence or the end of life of certain products if we ultimately determine that we have excess supply we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margins we record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value 

alternatively insufficient supply levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential end customers turn to competitors’ products that are readily available additionally any increases in the time required to manufacture our products or ship products could result in supply shortfalls if we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

because some of the key components in our products come from sole limited sources of supply we are susceptible to supply shortages or supply changes which could disrupt or delay our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers and may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

our products rely on key components including integrated circuit components and power supplies that our contract manufacturers purchase on our behalf from a limited number of suppliers including certain sole source providers we do not have guaranteed supply contracts with any of our component suppliers and our suppliers could delay shipments or cease manufacturing such products or selling them to us at any time for example in the past we have experienced shortages in inventory for dynamic random access memory integrated circuits and delayed releases of the next generation of chipset which delayed our production andor the release of our new products the development of alternate sources for those components is timeconsuming difficult and costly if we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of these components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner sales of our products could be delayed or halted entirely or we may be required to redesign our products any of these events could result in lost sales and damage to our endcustomer relationships which would adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our reliance on component suppliers also yields the potential for their infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property rights with respect to components which may be incorporated into our products we may not be indemnified by such component suppliers for such infringement or misappropriation claims any litigation for which we do not receive indemnification could require us to incur significant legal expenses in defending against such claims or require us to pay substantial royalty payments or settlement amounts that would not be reimbursed by our component suppliers 

our product development efforts are also dependent upon our continued collaboration with our key merchant silicon vendors such as broadcom and intel as we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors it is critical that we work in tandem with our key merchant silicon vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features this enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions 

if our key merchant silicon vendors do not continue to collaborate in such a fashion if they do not continue to innovate or if there are delays in the release of their products our own product launches could be delayed which could have a material effect on revenue and business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in the event of a shortage or supply interruption from our component suppliers we may not be able to develop alternate or second sources in a timely manner further longterm supply and maintenance obligations to end customers increase the duration for which specific components are required which may increase the risk of component shortages or the cost of carrying inventory in addition our component suppliers change their selling prices frequently in response to market trends including industrywide increases in demand 

and because we do not have contracts with these suppliers we are susceptible to price fluctuations related to raw materials and components if we are unable to pass component price increases along to our end customers or maintain stable pricing our gross margins could be adversely affected and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

because we depend on thirdparty manufacturers to build our products we are susceptible to manufacturing delays and pricing fluctuations that could prevent us from shipping endcustomer orders on time if at all or on a costeffective basis which may result in the loss of sales and end customers 

we depend on thirdparty contract manufacturers primarily jabil circuit and foxconn as our sole source manufacturers for our product lines a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to these thirdparty contract manufacturers our reliance on these thirdparty contract manufacturers reduces our control over the manufacturing process quality assurance product costs and product supply and timing which exposes us to risk to the extent that our products are manufactured at facilities in foreign countries we may be subject to additional risks associated with complying with local rules and regulations in those jurisdictions if we fail to manage our relationships with our thirdparty manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers experience delays disruptions or quality control problems in their operations this could severely impair our ability to fulfill orders on time if at all or on a costeffective basis 

our reliance on contract manufacturers also yields the potential for their infringement of third party intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of our products or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights in the manufacturing of other customers’ products if we are unable to manage our relationships with our thirdparty contract manufacturers effectively or if these thirdparty manufacturers suffer delays or disruptions for any reason experience increased manufacturing lead times capacity constraints or quality control problems in their manufacturing operations or fail to meet our future requirements for timely delivery our ability to ship products to our end customers would be severely impaired and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be seriously harmed 

our contract manufacturers typically fulfill our supply requirements on the basis of individual orders we do not have longterm contracts with our thirdparty manufacturers that guarantee capacity the continuation of particular pricing terms or the extension of credit limits accordingly they are not obligated to continue to fulfill our supply requirements which could result in supply shortages and the prices we are charged for manufacturing services could be increased on short notice for example a competitor could place large orders with the thirdparty manufacturer thereby utilizing all or substantially all of such thirdparty manufacturer’s capacity and leaving the manufacturer little or no capacity to fulfill our individual orders without price increases or delays or at all our contract with one of our contract manufacturers permits it to terminate the agreement for convenience subject to prior notice requirements we may not be able to develop alternate or second contract manufacturers in a timely manner if we are required to change contract manufacturers our ability to meet our scheduled product deliveries to our end customers could be adversely affected which could cause the loss of sales to existing or potential end customers delayed revenue or an increase in our costs which could adversely affect our gross margins the addition of contract manufacturers or manufacturing locations also would increase the complexity of our supply chain management any production interruptions or disruptions for any reason such as a natural disaster epidemic capacity shortages adverse results from intellectual property litigation or quality problems at one of our manufacturing partners would adversely affect sales of our product lines manufactured by that manufacturing partner and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are unable to increase market awareness of our company and our products our revenue may not continue to grow or may decline 

we have not yet established broad market awareness of our products and services market awareness of our value proposition and products and services will be essential to our continued growth and our success particularly for the service provider and large enterprise markets if our marketing efforts are unsuccessful in creating market awareness of our company and our products and services then our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected and we will not be able to achieve sustained growth 

the sales prices of our products and services may decrease which may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our results of operations 

the sales prices for our products and services may decline for a variety of reasons including competitive pricing pressures discounts a change in our mix of products and services the introduction of new products and services by us or by our competitors promotional programs product and related warranty costs or broader macroeconomic factors in addition we have provided and may in the future provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers 

we have experienced declines in sales prices for our products including our 10 gigabit ethernet modular and fixed switches competition continues to increase in the market segments in which we participate and we expect competition to further increase in the future thereby leading to increased pricing pressures larger competitors with more diverse product and service offerings may reduce the price of products and services that compete with ours or may bundle them with other products and services additionally although we price our products worldwide in us dollars currency fluctuations in certain countries and regions may adversely affect actual prices that partners and end customers are willing to pay in those countries and regions furthermore we anticipate that the sales prices and 

gross profits for our products will decrease over product life cycles decreased sales prices for any reason may reduce our gross profits and adversely affect our result of operations 

seasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations 

we operate on a december 31 year end and believe that there are significant seasonal factors which may cause sequential product revenue growth to be greater for the second and fourth quarters of our year than our first and third quarters we believe that this seasonality results from a number of factors including the procurement budgeting and deployment cycles of many of our end customers our rapid historical growth may have reduced the impact of seasonal or cyclical factors that might have influenced our business to date as our increasing size causes our growth rate to slow seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced over time and may materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are unable to hire retain train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could suffer 

our future success depends in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel particularly software engineering and sales personnel competition for highly skilled personnel is often intense especially in the san francisco bay area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have to provide more attractive compensation packages and other amenities research and development personnel are aggressively recruited by startup and emerging growth companies which are especially active in many of the technical areas and geographic regions in which we conduct product development in addition in making employment decisions particularly in the hightechnology industry job candidates often consider the value of the stockbased compensation they are to receive in connection with their employment declines in the market price of our stock could adversely affect our ability to attract motivate or retain key employees if we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel or if there are delays in hiring required personnel our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be seriously harmed 

also to the extent we hire personnel from competitors we may be subject to allegations that such personnel has been improperly solicited that such personnel has divulged proprietary or other confidential information or that former employers own certain inventions or other work product such claims could result in litigation please see “—we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us” 

our future performance also depends on the continued services and continuing contributions of our senior management to execute our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations our employment arrangements with our employees do not require that they continue to work for us for any specified period and therefore they could terminate their employment with us at any time the loss of our key personnel including jayshree ullal our chief executive officer andy bechtolsheim our founder and chief development officer and kenneth duda our founder chief technology officer and svp software engineering or other members of our senior management team sales and marketing team or engineering team or any difficulty attracting or retaining other highly qualified personnel in the future could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are subject to a number of risks associated with the expansion of our international sales and operations 

our ability to grow our business and our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our operations and customer base worldwide we have a limited history of marketing selling and supporting our products and services internationally operating in a global marketplace we are subject to risks associated with having an international reach and requirements such as compliance with applicable anticorruption laws 

one such applicable anticorruption law is the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa which generally prohibits us companies and its employees and intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business securing an advantage and directing business to another and requires companies to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls under the fcpa us companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors officers employees agents or other strategic or local partners or representatives as such if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the fcpa or similar legislation governmental authorities in the us and elsewhere could seek to impose civil andor criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditions we are currently in the early stages of implementing an anticorruption compliance program failure to comply with anticorruption and antibribery laws such as the fcpa and the united kingdom bribery act of 2010 or the united kingdom bribery act and similar laws associated with our activities outside the us could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences we intend to increase our international sales and business and as such the risk of violating laws such as the fcpa and united kingdom bribery act increases 

additionally as a result of our international reach we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations to the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting training managing and retaining an international staff and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets we also enter into strategic distributor and reseller relationships with companies in certain international markets where we do not have a local presence if we are not able to maintain successful strategic distributor relationships internationally or to recruit additional companies to enter into strategic distributor relationships our future success in these international markets could be limited business practices in the 

international markets that we serve may differ from those in the us and may require us in the future to include terms other than our standard terms in endcustomer contracts although to date we generally have not done so to the extent that we may enter into endcustomer contracts in the future that include nonstandard terms related to payment warranties or performance obligations our results of operations may be adversely affected 

additionally our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks including the following 

 these and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenue and consequently materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects expanding our existing international operations and entering into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial commitments our failure to successfully manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit our future growth or materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings and our failure to offer highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

once our products are deployed within our end customers’ networks our end customers depend on our support organization and our channel partners to resolve any issues relating to our products highquality support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products if we or our channel partners do not assist our end customers in deploying our products effectively do not succeed in helping our end customers resolve postdeployment issues quickly or do not provide adequate ongoing support it could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing end customers and could harm our reputation with potential end customers in addition as we expand our operations internationally our support organization will face additional challenges including those associated with delivering support training and documentation in languages other than english our failure or the failure of our channel partners to maintain highquality support and services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 

from time to time we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business including patent copyright commercial product liability employment class action whistleblower and other litigation and claims and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings such matters can be timeconsuming divert management’s attention and resources cause us to incur significant expenses or liability andor require us to change our business practices because of the potential risks expenses and uncertainties of litigation we may from time to time settle disputes even where we have meritorious claims or defenses by agreeing to settlement agreements because litigation is inherently unpredictable we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

for more information regarding the litigation in which we are currently involved see part i item 3 of “legal proceedings” in this annual report on form 10k 

adverse economic conditions or reduced information technology and network infrastructure spending may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on the overall demand for information technology network connectivity and access to data and applications weak domestic or global economic conditions fear or anticipation of such conditions or a reduction in information technology and 

network infrastructure spending even if economic conditions improve could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in a number of ways including longer sales cycles lower prices for our products and services higher default rates among our distributors reduced unit sales and lower or no growth for example the ongoing debt concerns in many countries in europe have caused and are likely to continue to cause uncertainty and instability in local economies and in global financial markets particularly if any future sovereign debt defaults or significant bank failures or defaults occur market uncertainty and instability in europe could intensify or spread further particularly if ongoing stabilization efforts prove insufficient concerns have been raised as to the financial political and legal ineffectiveness of measures taken to date continuing or worsening economic instability in europe and elsewhere could adversely affect spending for it network infrastructure systems and tools continued turmoil in the geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may also affect the overall demand for our products although we do not believe that our business financial condition results of operations and prospects have been significantly adversely affected by economic and political uncertainty in europe and other countries deterioration of such conditions may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in the future a prolonged period of economic uncertainty or a downturn may also significantly affect financing markets the availability of capital and the terms and conditions of financing arrangements including the overall cost of financing as well as the financial health or creditworthiness of our end customers circumstances may arise in which we need or desire to raise additional capital and such capital may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights or other lawsuits asserted against us could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

patent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the network infrastructure industry and have resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies many companies in the network infrastructure industry including our competitors and other third parties as well as nonpracticing entities own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets which they may use to assert claims of patent infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us from time to time they have or may in the future also assert such claims against us our end customers or channel partners whom we typically indemnify against claims that our products infringe misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties 

as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur claims of infringement misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase any claim of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights by a third party even those without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim distract our management from our business and require us to cease use of such intellectual property in addition some claims for patent infringement may relate to subcomponents that we purchase from third parties if these third parties are unable or unwilling to indemnify us for these claims we could be substantially harmed 

the patent portfolios of most of our competitors are larger than ours this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent crosslicenses in addition future assertions of patent rights by third parties and any resulting litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection we cannot assure you that we are not infringing or otherwise violating any thirdparty intellectual property rights 

the thirdparty asserters of intellectual property claims may be unreasonable in their demands or may simply refuse to settle which could lead to expensive settlement payments prolonged periods of litigation and related expenses additional burdens on employees or other resources distraction from our business supply stoppages and lost sales 

an adverse outcome of a dispute including those lawsuits described in part i item 3 of “legal proceedings” may require us to pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party’s patents cease making licensing or using solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property of others expend additional development resources to attempt to redesign our products or services or otherwise to develop noninfringing technology which may not be successful enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or intellectual property rights and indemnify our partners and other third parties any damages or royalty obligations we may become subject to as a result of an adverse outcome and any thirdparty indemnity we may need to provide could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects royalty or licensing agreements if required or desirable may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all and may require significant royalty payments and other expenditures further there is little or no information publicly available concerning market or fair values for license fees which can lead to overpayment of license or settlement fees in addition some licenses may be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us suppliers subject to thirdparty intellectual property claims also may choose or be forced to discontinue or alter their arrangements with us with little or no advance notice to us any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

for more information regarding the intellectual property disputes in which we are currently involved see part i item 3 of “legal proceedings” in this annual report on form 10k 

our standard sales contracts contain indemnification provisions requiring us to defend our end customers against thirdparty claims including against infringement of certain intellectual property rights that could expose us to losses which could seriously harm our business financial conditions results of operations and prospects 

under the indemnification provisions of our standard sales contracts we agree to defend our end customers against thirdparty claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights which may include patents copyrights trademarks or trade secrets and to pay judgments entered on such claims our exposure under these indemnification provisions is frequently limited to the total amount paid by our end customer under the agreement however certain agreements include indemnification provisions that could potentially expose us to losses in excess of the amount received under the agreement any of these events including claims for indemnification could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights 

we depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology we rely on trade secret patent copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties all of which offer only limited protection 

the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner we may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions further we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims to the extent that additional patents are issued from our patent applications which is not certain they may be contested circumvented or invalidated in the future moreover the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages and as with any technology competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future in addition we rely on confidentiality or license agreements with third parties in connection with their use of our products and technology there is no guarantee that such parties will abide by the terms of such agreements or that we will be able to adequately enforce our rights in part because we rely on “shrinkwrap” licenses in some instances 

we have not registered our trademarks in all geographic markets failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our ability to enforce and defend our trademark rights and result in indemnification claims further any claim of infringement by a third party even those claims without merit could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against such claim could divert management attention from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property in certain geographic markets 

despite our efforts the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights and our ability to police such misappropriation or infringement is uncertain particularly in countries outside of the united states 

detecting and protecting against the unauthorized use of our products technology and proprietary rights is expensive difficult and in some cases impossible litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources either of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and there is no guarantee that we would be successful furthermore many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to protecting their technology or intellectual property rights than we do accordingly despite our efforts we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property which could result in a substantial loss of our market share 

we rely on the availability of licenses to thirdparty software and other intellectual property 

many of our products and services include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties and we otherwise use software and other intellectual property licensed from third parties in our business this exposes us to risks over which we may have little or no control for example a licensor may have difficulties keeping up with technological changes or may stop supporting the software or other intellectual property that it licenses to us also it will be necessary in the future to renew licenses expand the scope of existing licenses or seek new licenses relating to various aspects of these products and services or otherwise relating to our business which may result in increased license fees these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms if at all in addition a third party may assert that we or our end customers are in breach of the terms of a license which could among other things give such third party the right to terminate a license or seek damages from us or both the inability to obtain or maintain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain or maintain such licenses or rights on favorable terms or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters could result in delays in releases of products and services and could otherwise disrupt our business until equivalent technology can be identified licensed or developed if at all and integrated into our products and services or otherwise in the conduct of our business moreover the inclusion in our products and services of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis may limit our ability to differentiate our products from those of our competitors any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products contain thirdparty open source software components and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our products 

our products contain software modules licensed to us by thirdparty authors under “open source” licenses use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of thirdparty commercial software as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of open source software that we use if we combine our software with open source software in a certain manner we could under certain open source licenses be required to release portions of the source code of our software to the public this would allow our competitors to create similar products with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of product sales for us 

although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts and these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products moreover we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products will be effective if we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products on terms that are not economically feasible to reengineer our products to discontinue the sale of our products if reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis or to make generally available in source code form our proprietary code any of which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

sales of our 7000 series of switches generate most of our product revenue and if we are unable to continue to grow sales of these products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

historically we have derived substantially all of our product revenue from sales of our 7000 series of switches and we expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future a decline in the price of these products and related services or our inability to increase sales of these products would harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects more seriously than if we derived significant revenue from a larger variety of product lines and services our future financial performance will also depend upon successfully developing and selling nextgeneration versions of our 7000 series of switches if we fail to deliver new products new features or new releases that end customers want and that allow us to maintain leadership in what will continue to be a competitive market environment our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and to be adversely affected by numerous factors 

we expect our gross margins to vary over time and to be affected by numerous factors including 

 to remain competitive we must successfully manage product introductions and transitions 

the success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including but not limited to timely and successful product development market acceptance our ability to manage the risks associated with new product production rampup issues the availability of new merchant silicon chips the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory in line with anticipated product demand the availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or deficiencies in the early stages of introduction accordingly we cannot determine in advance the ultimate effect of new product introductions and transitions on our business and results of operations 

our sales cycles can be long and unpredictable and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense as a result our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly 

the timing of our sales and revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of our products’ sales cycles a sales cycle is the period between initial contact with a prospective end customer and any sale of our products endcustomer orders often involve the purchase of multiple products these orders are complex and difficult to complete because prospective end customers generally consider a number of factors over an extended period of time before committing to purchase the products and solutions we sell end customers especially in the case of our large end customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision and require considerable time to evaluate test and qualify our products prior to making a purchase decision and placing an order the length of time that end customers devote to their evaluation contract negotiation and budgeting processes varies significantly our products’ sales cycles can be lengthy in certain cases especially with respect to our prospective large end customers during the sales cycle we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities and make investments in evaluation equipment all of which lower our operating margins particularly if no sale occurs even if an end customer decides to purchase our products there are many factors affecting the timing of our recognition of revenue which makes our revenue difficult to forecast for example there may be unexpected delays in an end customer’s internal procurement processes particularly for some of our larger end customers for which our products represent a very small percentage of their total procurement activity there are many other factors specific to end customers that contribute to the timing of their purchases and the variability of our revenue recognition including the strategic importance of a particular project to an end customer budgetary constraints and changes in their personnel 

even after an end customer makes a purchase there may be circumstances or terms relating to the purchase that delay our ability to recognize revenue from that purchase for example the sale of our products may be subject to acceptance testing in addition the significance and timing of our product enhancements and the introduction of new products by our competitors may also affect end customers’ purchases for all of these reasons it is difficult to predict whether a sale will be completed the particular period in which a sale will be completed or the period in which revenue from a sale will be recognized if our sales cycles lengthen our revenue could be lower than expected which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business depends on end customers renewing their maintenance and support contracts any decline in maintenance renewals could harm our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we typically sell our products with maintenance and support as part of the initial purchase and a portion of our annual revenue comes from renewals of maintenance and support contracts our end customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance and support contracts after the expiration of the initial period and they may elect not to renew their maintenance and support contracts to renew their maintenance and support contracts at lower prices through alternative channel partners or to reduce the product quantity under their maintenance and support contracts thereby reducing our future revenue from maintenance and support contracts if our end customers especially our large end customers do not renew their maintenance and support contracts or if they renew them on terms that are less favorable to us our revenue may decline and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will suffer 

industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

most of our competitors have made acquisitions andor have entered into or extended partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer more comprehensive product lines including cloud networking solutions for example in the last few years alone dell acquired force10 ibm acquired blade network technology hewlett packard acquired 3com brocade acquired foundry networks juniper acquired contrail and vmware acquired nicira 

moreover large system vendors are increasingly seeking to deliver toptobottom cloud networking solutions to end customers that combine cloudfocused hardware and software solutions to provide an alternative to our products 

we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors thereby reducing their business with us industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete with us including any competitors that seek to become sole source vendors for end customers this could lead to more variability in our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business is subject to the risks of warranty claims product returns product liability and product defects 

our products are very complex and despite testing prior to their release they have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors especially when first introduced or when new versions are released product defects or errors could affect the performance of our products and could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products adversely affect our reputation and our end customers’ willingness to buy products from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our products could cause us to lose revenue or market share increase our service costs cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the products cause us to lose significant endcustomers subject us to liability for damages and 

divert our resources from other tasks any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

additionally real or perceived errors failures or bugs in our products could result in claims by end customers for losses that they sustain if end customers make these types of claims we may be required or may choose for endcustomer relations or other reasons to expend additional resources in order to address the problem we may also be required to repair or replace such products or provide a refund for the purchase price for such products liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale and those of our resellers and distributors may not be enforceable under some circumstances or may not fully or effectively protect us from endcustomer claims and related liabilities and costs including indemnification obligations under our agreements with end customers resellers and distributors the sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims we maintain insurance to protect against certain types of claims associated with the use of our products but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any such claims in addition even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in expenditures of funds in connection with litigation and divert management’s time and other resources 

in addition to our own direct sales force we rely on distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers to sell our products and our failure to effectively develop manage or prevent disruptions to our distribution channels and the processes and procedures that support them could cause a reduction in the number of end customers of our products 

our future success is highly dependent upon maintaining our relationships with distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers and establishing additional sales channel relationships we anticipate that sales of our products to a limited number of channel partners will continue to account for a material portion of our total product revenue for the foreseeable future we provide our channel partners with specific training and programs to assist them in selling our products but these steps may not be effective in addition our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing selling and supporting our products and services if we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive programs for our channel partners we may not be able to incentivize these partners to sell our products to end customers these partners may have incentives to promote our competitors’ products to the detriment of our own or may cease selling our products altogether one of our channel partners could elect to consolidate or enter into a strategic partnership with one of our competitors which could reduce or eliminate our future opportunities with that channel partner our agreements with our channel partners may generally be terminated for any reason by either party with advance notice we may be unable to retain these channel partners or secure additional or replacement channel partners the loss of one or more of our significant channel partners requires extensive training and any new or expanded relationship with a channel partner may take several months or more to achieve productivity 

where we rely on the channel partners for sales of our products we may have little or no contact with the ultimate users of our products that purchase through such channel partners thereby making it more difficult for us to establish brand awareness ensure proper delivery and installation of our products service ongoing endcustomer requirements estimate endcustomer demand and respond to evolving endcustomer needs in addition our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits potential liability and reputational harm if for example any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to end customers fail to comply with their contractual obligations or violate laws or our corporate policies if we fail to effectively manage our existing sales channels or if our channel partners are unsuccessful in fulfilling the orders for our products if we are unable to enter into arrangements with and retain a sufficient number of highquality channel partners in each of the regions in which we sell products and keep them motivated to sell our products our ability to sell our products and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be harmed 

a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 

we anticipate increasing our sales efforts to us and foreign federal state and local governmental end customers in the future sales to government entities are subject to a number of risks selling to government entities can be highly competitive expensive and time consuming often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale the substantial majority of our sales to date to government entities have been made indirectly through our channel partners government certification requirements for products like ours may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we have attained revised certifications government demand and payment for our products and services may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products and services government entities may have statutory contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default and any such termination may adversely impact our future business financial condition results of operations and prospects selling to government entities may also require us to comply with various regulations that are not applicable to sales to nongovernment entities including regulations that may relate to pricing classified material and other matters complying with such regulations may also require us to put in place controls and procedures to monitor compliance with the applicable regulations that may be costly or not possible we are not currently certified to perform work under classified contracts with government entities failure to comply with any such regulations could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition governments routinely investigate and audit government contractors’ administrative processes and any unfavorable audit could result in the government ceasing to buy our products and services a reduction of revenue fines or civil or criminal liability if the audit uncovers improper or illegal activities any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the us government may require certain products that it purchases to be manufactured in the us and other relatively highcost manufacturing locations and we may not manufacture all products in locations that meet these requirements any 

of these and other circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our products must interoperate with operating systems software applications and hardware that is developed by others and if we are unable to devote the necessary resources to ensure that our products interoperate with such software and hardware we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening demand for our products 

generally our products comprise only a part of the data center and must interoperate with our end customers’ existing infrastructure specifically their networks servers software and operating systems which may be manufactured by a wide variety of vendors and original equipment manufacturers or oems our products must comply with established industry standards in order to interoperate with the servers storage software and other networking equipment in the data center such that all systems function efficiently together we depend on the vendors of servers and systems in a data center to support prevailing industry standards often these vendors are significantly larger and more influential in driving industry standards than we are also some industry standards may not be widely adopted or implemented uniformly and competing standards may emerge that may be preferred by our end customers 

in addition when new or updated versions of these software operating systems or applications are introduced we must sometimes develop updated versions of our software so that our products will interoperate properly we may not accomplish these development efforts quickly costeffectively or at all these development efforts require capital investment and the devotion of engineering resources if we fail to maintain compatibility with these systems and applications our end customers may not be able to adequately utilize our products and we may lose or fail to increase market share and experience a weakening in demand for our products among other consequences which would adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate these controls 

our products may be subject to various export controls and because we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products certain of our products may be exported from various countries only with the required export license or through an export license exception if we were to fail to comply with the applicable export control laws customs regulations economic sanctions or other applicable laws we could be subject to monetary damages or the imposition of restrictions which could be material to our business operating results and prospects and could also harm our reputation further there could be criminal penalties for knowing or willful violations including incarceration for culpable employees and managers obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be timeconsuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities furthermore certain export control and economic sanctions laws prohibit the shipment of certain products technology software and services to embargoed countries and sanctioned governments entities and persons even though we take precautions to ensure that our channel partners comply with all relevant regulations any failure by our channel partners to comply with such regulations could have negative consequences including reputational harm government investigations and penalties 

as our company grows we also continue developing procedures and controls to comply with export control and other applicable laws historically we have had some instances where we inadvertently have not fully complied with certain export control laws but we have disclosed them to and implemented corrective actions with the appropriate government agencies 

in addition various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology including through import permit and license requirements and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our end customers’ ability to implement our products in those countries any change in export or import regulations economic sanctions or related legislation shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries governments persons or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our products by or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential end customers with international operations or create delays in the introduction of our products into international markets any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our business is subject to regulation by various federal state local and foreign governmental agencies including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws workplace safety product safety environmental laws consumer protection laws antibribery laws importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the united states from time to time we may receive inquiries from such governmental agencies or we may make voluntary disclosures regarding our compliance with applicable governmental regulations or requirements relating to importexport controls federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations which could lead to formal investigations noncompliance with applicable government regulations or requirements could subject us to sanctions mandatory product recalls enforcement actions disgorgement of profits fines damages civil and criminal penalties or injunctions if any governmental sanctions are imposed or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected in addition responding to any action will likely result in a significant 

diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we may invest in or acquire other businesses which could require significant management attention disrupt our business dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as part of our business strategy we have and may continue to make investments in complementary companies products or technologies which could involve licenses additional channels of distribution discount pricing or investments in or acquisitions of other companies however we do not have significant experience in making investments in other companies nor have we made any acquisitions to date and as a result our ability as an organization to evaluate andor complete investments or acquire and integrate other companies products or technologies in a successful manner is unproven we may not be able to find suitable investment or acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete such investments or acquisitions on favorable terms if at all if we do complete investments or acquisitions we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals and any investments or acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our end customers investors and securities analysts 

in addition investments and acquisitions may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures for example if we are unsuccessful at integrating any acquisitions or retaining key talent from those acquisitions or the technologies associated with such acquisitions into our company the business financial condition results of operations and prospects of the combined company could be adversely affected any integration process may require significant time and resources and we may not be able to manage the process successfully we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel or accurately forecast the financial effects of an acquisition transaction including accounting charges we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such investment or acquisition each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations moreover if the investment or acquisition becomes impaired we may be required to take an impairment charge which could adversely affect our financial condition or the market price of our common stock 

if we needed to raise additional capital to expand our operations and invest in new products our failure to do so on favorable terms could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future if we did need to raise additional funds to expand our operations and invest in new products we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms if at all if we raise additional equity financing our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the market price of our common stock could decline furthermore if we engage in debt financing the holders of such debt would have priority over the holders of common stock and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or impose other restrictions on our business we may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders including maintaining specified liquidity or other ratios any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms if at all we may not be able to among other things 

 our failure to do any of these things could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as described in part ii item 7 of “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities equity revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition stockbased compensation contract manufacturing liabilities and income taxes if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions our results of operations may be adversely affected and may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock 

we are exposed to the credit risk of our channel partners and some of our end customers which could result in material losses   

most of our sales are on an open credit basis with standard payment terms of 30 days in the united states and because of local customs or conditions longer in some markets outside the us we monitor individual endcustomer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the end customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts we are unable to recognize revenue from shipments until the collection of those amounts becomes reasonably assured any significant delay or default in the collection of significant accounts receivable could result in an increased need for us to obtain working capital from other sources possibly on worse terms than we could have negotiated if we had established such working capital resources prior to such delays or defaults any significant default could adversely affect our results of operations and delay our ability to recognize revenue 

a material portion of our sales is derived through our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers some of our distributors systems integrators and valueadded resellers may experience financial difficulties which could adversely affect our collection of accounts receivable distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other systems integrators valueadded resellers and end customers distributors represent potential sources of increased credit risk because they may be less likely to have the reserve resources required to meet payment obligations our exposure to credit risks of our channel partners may increase if our channel partners and their end customers are adversely affected by global or regional economic conditions one or more of these channel partners could delay payments or default on credit extended to them either of which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we or our partners fail to comply with environmental requirements our business financial condition results of operations prospects and reputation could be adversely affected 

we and our partners including our contract manufacturers are subject to various local state federal and international environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our products and laws relating to the collection recycling and disposal of electrical and electronic equipment examples of these laws and regulations include the european union or eu restrictions on the use of hazardous substances directive or rohs directive and the eu waste electrical and electronic equipment directive or weee directive as well as the implementing legislation of the eu member states similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in china south korea norway and japan and may be enacted in other regions including in the us and we or our partners including our contract manufacturers are or may in the future be subject to these laws and regulations 

the eu rohs directive and the similar laws of other jurisdictions limit the content of certain hazardous materials such as lead mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment including our products our products currently comply with the rohs directive however if there are future changes to this directive we may be required to reengineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations this reengineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics 

we are also subject to environmental laws and regulations governing the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes our failure or the failure of our partners including our contract manufacturers to comply with past present and future environmental laws could result in fines penalties thirdparty claims reduced sales of our products substantial product inventory writeoffs and reputational damage any of which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we also expect that our business will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis applicable to us and our partners including our contract manufacturers to date our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows although we cannot predict the future effect of such laws or regulations they will likely result in additional costs or require us to change the content or manufacturing of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our sales contracts are primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore substantially all of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk however a strengthening us dollar could increase the real cost of our products to our end customers outside of the us which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase our product and operating costs in foreign locations further an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the us is denominated in foreign currencies and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates if we are not able to successfully hedge against the risks associated with the currency fluctuations our business financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes fire power outages floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by manmade problems such as terrorism 

our corporate headquarters and the operations of our key manufacturing vendors logistics providers and partners as well as many of our customers are located in areas exposed to risks of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis including the san francisco bay area japan and taiwan a significant natural disaster such as an earthquake tsunami fire or a flood or other catastrophic event such as a disease outbreak could have a material adverse effect on our or their business which could in turn materially affect our 

financial condition results of operations and prospects for example in the event our service providers’ information technology systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above shipments could be delayed which could result in missed financial targets such as revenue and shipment targets for a particular quarter further if a natural disaster occurs in a region from which we derive a significant portion of our revenue end customers in that region may delay or forego purchases of our products which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our manufacturer logistics providers partners or end customers or the economy as a whole given our typical concentration of sales at each quarter end any disruption in the business of our manufacturer logistics providers partners or end customers that affects sales at the end of our quarter could have a particularly significant adverse effect on our quarterly results all of the aforementioned risks may be augmented if our disaster recovery plans and those of our manufacturers logistics providers or partners prove to be inadequate to the extent that any of the above results in delays or cancellations of endcustomer orders or delays in the manufacture deployment or shipment of our products our business financial condition results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected 

breaches of our cybersecurity systems could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services to our customers delay our ability to recognize revenue compromise the integrity of our software products result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property damage our reputation expose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data 

we increasingly depend upon our it systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or that of our website and misappropriate our proprietary information or cause interruptions of our service because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques in addition sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system we have also outsourced a number of our business functions to thirdparties including our manufacturers logistics providers and cloud service providers and our business operations also depend in part on the success of these third parties own cybersecurity measures similarly we rely upon distributors resellers and system integrators to sell our products and our sales operations depend in part on the reliability of their cybersecurity measures additionally we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our it resources in safe and secure fashion that does not expose our network systems to security breaches and the loss of data accordingly if our cybersecurity systems and those of our contractors fail to protect against unauthorized access sophisticated cyber attacks and the mishandling of data by our employees and contractors our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways including 

 should any of the above events occur we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our customers and regulatory actions from governmental agencies in addition our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised and our reputation and competitive position could be significantly harmed also the regulatory and contractual actions litigations investigations fines penalties and liabilities relating to data breaches that result in losses of personally identifiable or credit card information of users of our services can be significant in terms of fines and reputational impact and necessitate changes to our business operations that may be disruptive to us additionally we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and remediate damages consequently our financial performance and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we believe our longterm value as a company will be greater if we focus primarily on growth instead of profitability 

our business strategy is to focus primarily on our longterm growth as a result our profitability in any given period may be lower than it would be if our strategy was to maximize shortterm profitability expenditures on research and development sales and marketing infrastructure and other such investments may not ultimately grow our business prospects or cause long term profitability for example in order to support our strong growth we have accelerated our investment in infrastructure such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations as a result we expect our levels of operating profit could decline in the short to medium term if we are ultimately unable to achieve profitability at the level anticipated by analysts and our stockholders the market price of our common stock may decline 

we may not generate positive returns on our research and development investments 

developing our products is expensive and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle in 2014  2013  and 2012  our research and development expenses were 1489 million  or approximately 255  of our revenue 986 million  or approximately 273  of our revenue and 552 million  or approximately 285  of our revenue respectively we expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts by investing in research and development we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity we expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these investments these investments may take several years to generate positive returns if ever 

we provide access to our software and other selected source code to certain partners which creates additional risk that our competitors could develop products that are similar to or better than ours 

our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our internally developed technology which is incorporated in the source code for our products we seek to protect the source code design code documentation and other information relating to our software under trade secret patent and copyright laws however we have chosen to provide access to selected source code of our software to several of our partners for codevelopment as well as for open application programming interfaces or apis formats and protocols though we generally control access to our source code and other intellectual property and enter into confidentiality or license agreements with such partners as well as with our employees and consultants this combination of procedural and contractual safeguards may be insufficient to protect our trade secrets and other rights to our technology our protective measures may be inadequate especially because we may not be able to prevent our partners employees or consultants from violating any agreements or licenses we may have in place or abusing their access granted to our source code improper disclosure or use of our source code could help competitors develop products similar to or better than ours 

changes in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application of existing tax laws of various jurisdictions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results 

    our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several factors many of which are outside of our control including earnings that are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our ability to generate and use tax attributes changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities expiration of or lapses in the rd tax credit laws transfer pricing adjustments including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany rd cost sharing arrangement and legal structure tax effects of nondeductible compensation including certain stockbased compensation tax costs related to intercompany realignments changes in accounting principles adverse tax consequences including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries or customers a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings or changes in tax laws and regulations including possible us changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income or the foreign tax credit rules 

  significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions and determine our provision for income taxes the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all income tax positions including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paidin capital in addition tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied recent changes to us tax laws including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the us are repatriated to the us as well as changes to us tax laws that may be enacted in the future could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings as well as cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain outside of the us 

  further we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities audits by the internal revenue service or other tax authorities are subject to inherent uncertainties and could result in unfavorable outcomes including potential fines or penalties as we operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions the expense of defending and resolving such an audit may be significant the amount of time to resolve an audit is also unpredictable and may divert management’s attention from our business operations we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we cannot assure you that fluctuations in our provision for income taxes or our effective tax rate the enactment of new tax laws or changes in the application or interpretation of existing tax laws or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns by tax authorities will not have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we do not effectively expand and train our direct sales force we may be unable to add new end customers or increase sales to our existing end customers and our business will be adversely affected 

we depend on our direct sales force to obtain new end customers and increase sales with existing end customers as such we have invested and will continue to invest substantially in our sales organization in recent periods we have been adding personnel and other resources to our sales function as we focus on growing our business entering new markets and increasing our market share and we expect to incur significant additional expenses in expanding our sales personnel in order to achieve revenue growth there is significant 

competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in recruiting training retaining and integrating sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth particularly in international markets new hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect and we may be unable to hire retain or integrate into our corporate culture sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business in addition because we continue to grow rapidly a large percentage of our sales force is new to our company if we are unable to hire integrate and train a sufficient number of effective sales personnel or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new end customers or increasing sales to our existing endcustomer base our business financial condition results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected 

new regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products 

as a public company we will be subject to new requirements under the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 or the doddfrank act that will require us to perform diligence and disclose and report whether or not our products contain conflict minerals the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our products in addition we will incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements including costs related to conducting diligence procedures and if applicable potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities we may also face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflictfree or if we are unable to alter our products processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials 

risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock   

the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the value of your investment could decline 

technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in june 2014 at the price of 4300 per share our stock price has ranged from 4300 per share to 9484 per share through december 31 2014 the trading price of our common stock has historically been and is likely to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following 

 in addition if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the market price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the market price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company if the market price of our common stock is volatile we may become the target of securities litigation securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources from our business and prospects this could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets or the perception that such sales might occur could reduce the market price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate 

based on shares outstanding as of december 31 2014  holders of up to approximately 28428975 shares or 434 of our common stock have rights subject to some conditions to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders we have registered the offer and sale of all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans if holders by exercising their registration rights sell large numbers of shares it could adversely affect our market price 

in addition we may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible into our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing acquisition investments or otherwise any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 

insiders have substantial control over us which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions including a change of control 

our directors executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 5 of our outstanding common stock together with their affiliates in the aggregate beneficially own approximately 566 of the outstanding shares of our common stock based on shares outstanding as of december 31 2014  as a result these stockholders if acting together will be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders including the election of directors and the approval of mergers acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions they may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests this concentration of ownership may also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock or otherwise may have the effect of delaying preventing or deterring a change of control of our company could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock 

we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared nor paid any dividends on our common stock we intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and prospects and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases 

if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research reports about our business or prospects the market price of our common stock and trading volume could decline 

the trading market for our common stock to some extent depends on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business or prospects we do not have any control over these analysts if one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares the market price of our common stock would likely decline if one or more of these analysts should cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which could cause the market price of our common stock or trading volume to decline 

our charter documents and delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company these provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions including effecting changes in our management these provisions include 

 37 

 in addition as a delaware corporation we are subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law these provisions may prohibit large stockholders in particular those owning 15 or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time 

the issuance of additional stock in connection with financings acquisitions investments our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders

overview 

we are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of largescale internet companies cloud service providers and nextgeneration data centers for enterprises based on market share our cloud networking solutions consist of our extensible operating system or eos a set of network applications and our 1040100 gigabit ethernet switches our cloud networking solutions deliver industryleading performance scalability availability programmability automation and visibility at the core of our cloud networking platform is eos which was purposebuilt to be fully programmable and highly modular the programmability of eos has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking including workflow automation network visibility and analytics and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of thirdparty applications for virtualization management automation orchestration and network services 

we were founded in 2004 to address the limitations of legacy networking products and to create a cloud networking platform that is open and programmable from 2004 to 2008 our activities were focused on the development of our software which resulted in the commercial release of our first product the 7100 series switches based on our eos software in 2008 since then we have continued to introduce new products utilizing eos including our 7500 series switch and our 7050 series switch in 2010 the second generation of our 7500 series switch called the 7500e modular switch in may 2013 our 7300 series switch in november 2013 our 7280e in july 2014 and in december 2014 our eos software platform for networking programmability and automation as of december 31 2014  we have shipped more than three million switch ports we have experienced rapid revenue growth over the last several years increasing our revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 689 from 2010 to 2014 as we have grown the functionality of our eos software expanded the range of our switching portfolio and increased the size of our sales force our revenue has continued to grow rapidly to support revenue growth we have increased our international presence to include offices in 11 countries as of december 31 2014  including australia canada china india ireland japan malaysia singapore south korea taiwan and the united kingdom our revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  was 5841 million  an increase of 617  compared to 2013 we have been profitable and cash flow positive for each year since 2010 

we believe that our cloud networking platform addresses the large and growing cloud networking segment of data center switching which remains in the early stage of adoption we expect to continue rapidly growing our organization to meet the needs of new and existing customers as they increasingly realize the performance and cost benefits of our cloud networking solutions and as they expand their cloud networks we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our rapid development of new features and applications by investing in research and development we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity we also intend to continue expanding our sales and marketing teams and programs with a particular focus on expanding our network of international channel partners and carrying out associated marketing activities in key geographies in order to support our strong growth we have accelerated our investment in infrastructure such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations as a result our levels of operating profit as a percentage of revenue could decline in the short to medium term for a description of factors that may impact our future performance see the disclosure in the section titled factors affecting our performance below 

our business model 

we derive revenue from sales of products and services we generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our eos software we generate the majority of our services revenue from post contract support or pcs which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products 

since shipping our first products in 2008 our cumulative endcustomer base has grown rapidly between december 31 2010 and december 31 2014  our cumulative endcustomer base grew from approximately 570 to over 3000 our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies service providers financial services organizations government agencies media and entertainment companies and others 

to continue to grow our revenue it is important that we both obtain new customers and sell additional products to existing customers our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our eos software and enhancements to eos we engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture today we combine our eos software with merchant silicon into a family of switching products this enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve costeffective solutions we currently procure certain merchant silicon components from multiple vendors and we continue to expand our relationships with these and other vendors we work closely with third parties to manufacture and deliver our products our thirdparty silicon vendors deliver these components to one of three direct fulfillment facilities where our eos software is installed on our products and then delivered to us for labeling quality assurance testing final configuration and shipment to our customers 

we market and sell our products through our direct sales force and in partnership with channel partners including distributors valueadded resellers systems integrators original equipment manufacturer or oem partners and in conjunction with various technology partners depending on the application to facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity we have created a partner program the arista partner program to engage partners who provide valueadded services and extend our reach into the marketplace authorized training partners provide technical training to our channel partners our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for presales technical support and engineering for our end customers each sales team is responsible for a geographic territory has responsibility for a number of major direct endcustomer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market during years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  797  829  and 799  of our revenue was generated from the americas substantially all from the us 128  112  and 119  from europe the middle east and africa and 75  59  and 82  from the asiapacific region respectively 

factors affecting our performance 

we believe that our future success will depend on many factors including our ability to expand sales to our existing customers as well as to add new end customers while these areas present significant opportunity they also present risks that we must manage to ensure successful results see the section titled “risk factors” additionally we face intense competition especially from larger wellestablished companies and we must continue to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform to succeed in our market if we are unable to address these challenges our business could be adversely affected 

increasing adoption of cloud networks networks are subject to increasing performance requirements due to growing numbers of connected devices as well as new enterprise and consumer applications computing architectures are evolving to meet the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications we believe that cloud networks will continue to replace legacy network technologies our business and results of operations will be significantly affected by the speed with which organizations implement cloud networks 

expanding sales to existing customer base we expect that a substantial portion of our future sales will be followon sales to existing end customers as noted above one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our cloud networking solutions thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers we believe this opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing and expected infrastructure spend as of december 31 2014 our end customers that have been with us for at least 2 years on average made additional purchases that were approximately 119x more than the initial dollar amount of purchases made in the first two quarters of their purchasing history the first 2 quarters of purchasing are typically the beginning of switch procurement for a given deployment and typically do not include time spent during initial customer testing as most customer testing is done prior to initial purchase although the additional purchases for our top 10 end customers were significantly more than our overall average the remainder of the end customer base also showed a propensity to continue purchasing with average additional purchases of 67x the initial dollar purchases made in the first two quarters of their purchasing history this analysis is based on billings which represent amounts invoiced to customers for products shipped or for services rendered or to be rendered and that the vast majority of billings for any given period represent revenue and to a far lesser extent deferred revenue our business and results of operations will depend on our ability to sell additional products to our growing base of customers 

adding new end customers we believe that the cloud networking market is still in the early stages of adoption we intend to target new end customers by continuing to invest in our field sales force and extending our relationships with channel partners to date we have primarily targeted end customers with the largest cloud data centers a typical initial order involves the education of prospective customers about the technical merits and capabilities and potential cost savings of our products as compared to our competitors’ products our results of operations will depend on our ability to continue to add new customers we believe that customer references have been and will continue to be an important factor in winning new business 

selling more complex and higherperformance configurations  our results of operations have been and we believe will continue to be affected by our ability to sell more complex and higherperformance configurations of our products going forward we aim to grow our revenue by enabling end customers to transition from previously deployed 1 gigabit ethernet switches to 10 40 and eventually 100 gigabit ethernet switches our ability to sustain our revenue growth will depend in part upon our continued sales of more robust configurations of our products and quarterly results of operations can be significantly impacted by the mix of products and product configurations sold during the period 

leveraging channel partners we expect to continue to derive a growing portion of our sales through our channel partners as they develop new end customers and expand sales to our existing end customers we plan to continue to invest in our network of channel partners to empower them to reach new end customers more effectively increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support effectively we believe that increasing channel leverage will extend and improve our engagement with a broad set of customers our business and results of operations will be materially affected by our success in leveraging our channel partners 

investing in research and development for growth we believe that the market for cloud networking is still in the early stages of adoption and we intend to continue investing for longterm growth we expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products including new releases and upgrades to our eos software and new applications and build upon our technology leadership we believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts by investing in research and development we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity we expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these product development investments 

customer concentration and timing of large orders  historically large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for significant portion of our revenue during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 our largest end customer accounted for 149 219 and 153 of our revenue respectively we have also experienced and continue to experience customer concentration on a quarterly basis in addition we have experienced increases in the size of our orders including orders from existing customers which could result in future increased customer concentration depending on the timing of the fulfillment of those orders we have also experienced unpredictability in the timing of large orders especially with respect to our large end customers due to the complexity of orders the time it takes end customers to evaluate test qualify and accept our products and factors specific to our end customers due to these factors we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis in addition we have provided and may in the future provide pricing discounts to large end customers which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers 

basis of presentation 

revenue 

we generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our eos software we also derive a small but growing portion of our revenue from sales of pcs we generate pcs revenue from sales of technical support services contracts that are typically purchased in conjunction with our products and subsequent renewals of those contracts we offer pcs services under renewable feebased contracts which include 24hour technical support hardware repair and replacement parts bug fixes patches and unspecified upgrades on a whenandif available basis we expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on among other things the timing and size of orders the delivery and acceptance of products the impact of significant transactions with unique terms and conditions that may require deferral of revenue and cyclicality of orders being placed by our customers additionally we expect our pcs revenue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our installed base our ability to expand our installed base and increase our revenue is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties see the section titled “risk factors” we report revenue net of sales taxes 

cost of revenue 

cost of revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our thirdparty contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors overhead costs in our manufacturing operations department and other manufacturingrelated costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory we expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases cost of providing pcs services consists of personnel costs for our global customer support organization we expect our cost of service revenue to increase as our pcs revenue increases 

gross margin 

gross margin or gross profit as a percentage of revenue has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors including sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing the average sales price of our offerings manufacturing costs merchant silicon costs and the mix of products sold we expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time depending on the factors described above and others see part i item 1a of “risk factors” 

operating expenses 

our operating expenses consist of research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses the largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs personnel costs consist of wages benefits bonuses and with respect to sales and marketing expenses sales commissions personnel costs also include stockbased compensation and travel expenses we expect operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as we continue to invest in the growth of our business 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs with the remainder being prototype expenses thirdparty engineering and contractor support costs and an allocated portion of facility and it costs and depreciation our research and development efforts are focused on maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products and on new product development including new releases and upgrades to our eos software and applications we expense research and development costs as incurred we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership 

sales and marketing expenses 

sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and also include costs related to marketing and promotional activities with the remainder being an allocated portion of facility and it costs and depreciation we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide and expand our relationships with current and future channel partners and end customers 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs professional fees and an allocated portion of facility and it costs and depreciation general and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive finance it human resources and legal functions our professional fees consist primarily of accounting external legal and it and other consulting costs we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars to support our growing infrastructure needs and as we assume the reporting requirements and compliance obligations of a public company in addition we expect an increase in legal expenses to address current and potential litigation claims 

other income expense net 

interest expense 

interest expense consists of interest expense on our subordinated convertible promissory notes including our related party subordinated convertible promissory notes which were converted during fiscal 2014 and interest expense from our lease financing obligation 

other income expense 

other income expense consists of gains on investments writeoffs of debt discount on notes payable and foreign currency exchange gains and losses our foreign currency exchange gains and losses relate to transactions and asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar we expect our foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

provision for income taxes 

we operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business earnings from our nonus activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to us income tax generally the us taxes are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these earnings which avoids double taxation our tax expense to date consists of federal state and foreign current and deferred income taxes as we expand internationally our marginal tax rate may decrease however there can be no certainty that our marginal tax rate will decrease and we may experience changes in tax rates that are not reflective of actual changes in our business or operations 

we account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements but have not been reflected in our taxable income estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards we measure deferred income tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize 

we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

results of operations 

the following table summarizes historical results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of revenue for those periods we have derived the data for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  from our consolidated financial statements in thousands except for percentage of revenue

revenue cost of revenue and gross profit in thousands except percentages 

revenue revenue increased 2229 million  or 617  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013  the increase in revenue predominantly included an increase in sales of switch products and related accessories of 1960 million or 589 primarily to existing customers the increase in product revenue was largely driven by the number of switch ports shipped which increased by 824 during the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 partially offset by a reduction of 150 in the average selling price per port shipped the decrease in average selling price per port was primarily attributable to product mix and lower pricing terms for sales to large end customers our cumulative number of customers grew approximately 33 from december 31 2013 to december 31 2014 as we continued to broaden our market penetration 

cost of revenue cost of revenue increased 693 million  or 565  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013  the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to the corresponding increase in revenue as our shipment volume significantly increased during the year ended december 31 2014 resulting in an increase in product costs of 621 million during the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 

gross margin gross margin increased from 660  for the year ended december 31 2013  to 671  for 2014 the increase in gross margin was primarily the result of a reduction in warranty and excess and obsolete inventoryrelated charges of 103 million due to significant product quality issues and inventory obsolescence charges that did not recur during 2014 these charges were partially offset by an increase in manufacturing overhead charges of 74 million to support our revenue growth to a lesser extent gross margin was negatively impacted by a decrease in product margins due to product mix and an increase in the size of orders with volume discounts 

operating expenses in thousands except percentages 

research and development research and development expenses increased 503 million  or 510  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013 the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 390 million resulting from an increase of 156 employees a 341 increase from december 31 2013 to december 31 2014 and additional bonus expenses under our corporate bonus plan the increase was also due to an increase of 66 million in research and development related facilities and it infrastructure costs and increases in thirdparty engineering costs of 59 million and depreciation expense of 20 million as we continued to expand and support our research and development activities these expenses were partially offset by a 43 million reduction in prototype spending related to project timing 

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased 302 million  or 548  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013 the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 234 million resulting from an increase of 45 employees a 230 increase from december 31 2013 to december 31 2014 as well as an increase in sales commissions resulting from higher sales volume the increase was also due to an increase of 37 million in product demonstrations expenses incurred to expand our sales engineering labs to support our growing customer base consulting expenses and other marketing activities and an increase in it and infrastructure of 16 million 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased 136 million  or 730  for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013 the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 57 million resulting from an increase of 17 employees a 298 increase from december 31 2013 to december 31 2014 and additional expenses under our corporate bonus plan we also incurred higher professional service fees of 37 million related to outside legal accounting and consulting services to support increased business activity litigation and publiccompany activities the increase was also attributable to higher insurance expense and property taxes of 15 million associated with being a public company and a 10 million charitable donation through a fund established by the company in 2014 

other income expense net in thousands except percentages 

interest expense interest expense decreased during the year ended december 31 2014  compared to the same period in 2013 as a result of repayment and conversion of our notes payable upon our ipo during the second quarter of 2014 

other income expense net  other income expense net increased for the year ended december 31 2014  compared to 2013 due to the gain on our notes receivable of 40 million offset by a 07 million writeoff related to the debt discount on notes payable upon our ipo further offset by net transactional exchange rate losses

cost of revenue  cost of revenue increased 614 million or 1003 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 2012 the increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to the corresponding increase in revenue as our shipment volume significantly increased during the year ended december 31 2013 resulting in an increase in product costs of 465 million in 2013 compared to 2012 the increase was also due to an increase of 18 million in excess and obsolete material charges for noncancelable and nonreturnable purchase commitments by our thirdparty contract manufacturers as well as an increase in writedowns of excess and obsolete inventory of 21 million from the introduction of new products and product enhancements we also experienced an increase in manufacturing overhead costs of 43 million to support the growth in production during the year ended 2013 

gross margin  gross margin decreased approximately two percentage points from 683 for the year ended december 31 2012 to 660 for 2013 the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in excess and obsolete inventory and material charges noted above totaling 39 million and an increase in manufacturing overhead costs of 43 million the decrease was also due to a lesser extent to an increase in the size of contracts with large end customers with lower margins which was partially offset by cost reductions primarily due to more favorable component pricing from our contract manufacturers as we increased volume 

operating expenses in thousands except percentages 



research and development  research and development expenses increased 434 million or 787 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 2012 the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 218 million which was a result of an increase of 153 employees a 500 increase in research and development headcount the increase was also due to a 101 million increase in prototype expenses as a result of new product introductions and an increase in facilities expenses of 45 million 

sales and marketing  sales and marketing expenses increased 265 million or 927 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 2012 the increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of 198 million which was a result of an increase of 57 employees a 413 increase in sales and marketing headcount the increase was also due to an increase of 30 million in marketing consulting and promotional expense related to trade shows product demonstrations and other marketing activities and an increase in sales and marketingrelated it and system engineering expenses of 26 million 

general and administrative  general and administrative expenses increased 102 million or 1198 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 2012 the increase was primarily due to a 55 million increase in professional service fees related to outside legal accounting consulting and it services to support increased business activity and preparations for becoming a public company the increase was also due to a 34 million increase in personnel costs which was a result of an increase of 23 employees a 676 increase in general and administrative headcount

quarterly results of operations 

the following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the quarters in the years ended december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  as well as the percentage that each line item represents of total revenue the information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and in the opinion of management includes all adjustments which includes only normal recurring adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods in accordance with gaap this data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 





liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations as of december 31 2014  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were 4495 million  of which approximately 566 million was held outside the us in our foreign subsidiaries we have not repatriated nor do we currently have plans to repatriate these funds but if we were to repatriate cash held outside of the us for domestic cash operations we would be required to accrue and pay us income taxes to repatriate these funds less any previously paid foreign income taxes we consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of december 31 2014  to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no us income taxes have been provided thereon 

on june 6 2014 we completed our ipo in which we sold 6037500  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of 4300  per share which included 787500  shares of common stock issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment option by the underwriters the ipo resulted in proceeds of 2391 million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions of 156 million  and other issuance costs of 50 million  in connection with the closing of the ipo all of our outstanding convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 24000000  shares of common stock on a one toone basis 

upon the closing of our ipo   all noteholders with the exception of one noteholder converted the principal and accrued interest amount outstanding under their subordinated convertible promissory notes into shares of our common stock at the ipo price of 4300  per share the noteholder who did not elect to so convert was paid a total of 236 million  which included principal and accrued interest less applicable withholding taxes of 11 million  the remainder of the noteholders converted the remaining debt balance of approximately 965 million  including principal and accrued interest into 22 million  shares of our common stock 

our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes we plan to continue to invest for longterm growth one of the principal purposes of our ipo was to obtain additional capital to fund the growth of our business we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for the foreseeable future our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings our costs and access to outsourcing our manufacturing our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies as well as the continued market acceptance of our products if we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us if we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired our business operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

cash flows 





cash flows from operating activities 

our primary source of cash from operating activities has been from cash collections from our customers we expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increases in sales and timing of collections our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs and investment in sales and marketing and research and development we expect cash outflows from operating activities to increase as a result of further investment in sales and marketing and increases in personnel costs as we grow our business

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2014  we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 

contractual obligations and commitments   

our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity our contractual obligations represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations with terms in excess of one year we believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing cash balances 

the following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december 31 2014  in thousands 

 

1 includes interest and land lease 

the contractual obligation table above excludes tax liabilities of 186 million related to uncertain tax positions because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement if any of these future payments 

critical accounting policies and estimates   

we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods we base our estimates assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements which in turn could change the results from those reported we evaluate our estimates assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis the critical accounting estimates assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below 

revenue recognition 

we generate revenue from the sale of network switches which incorporate our eos software and accessories such as cables and optics to direct customers and channel partners together with pcs we typically sell products and pcs in a single transaction we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery or performance has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 

we define each of the four criteria above as follows 

• persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists evidence of an arrangement consists of standalone purchase orders or purchase orders issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a master sales agreement it is our practice to identify an end customer prior to shipment to a reseller or distributor 

• delivery or performance has occurred we use shipping documents or written evidence of customer acceptance when applicable to verify delivery or performance we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss which primarily is upon shipment to customers we generally do not have significant obligations for future performance rights of return pricing credits or customer acceptance provisions associated with our product sales in instances where substantive acceptance provisions are specified in the customer arrangement revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 

• the sales price is fixed or determinable we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 

• collectability is reasonably assured we assess probability of collectability on a customerbycustomer basis our customers and channel partners are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates their financial condition and ability to pay for products and services 

pcs is offered under renewable feebased contracts which include technical support hardware repair and replacement parts beyond standard warranty bug fixes patches and unspecified upgrades on a whenandifavailable basis we initially defer pcs revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the pcs contract with the related expenses recognized as incurred pcs contracts usually have a term of one to three years we include billed but unearned pcs revenue in deferred revenue 

we report revenue net of sales taxes we include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold 

multipleelement arrangements 

most of our arrangements other than renewals of pcs are multipleelement arrangements with a combination of products and pcs products and pcs generally qualify as separate units of accounting our hardware deliverables and included eos software together deliver the essential functionality of our products for multipleelement arrangements we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price the relative selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe if available thirdparty evidence or tpe if vsoe is not available and best estimate of selling price or besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available as we have not been able to establish vsoe or tpe for our products and most of our services we generally utilize besp for the purposes of allocating revenue to each unit of accounting 

   

 56 

 we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services future performance obligations or subject to customerspecific return acceptance or refund privileges 

we account for multiple agreements with a single partner as one  arrangement if the contractual terms andor substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are in effect parts of a single arrangement 

we may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is no contractual provision for such returns we estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied against currentperiod gross revenues specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate 

inventories 

inventories primarily consist of finished goods purchased from third party contract manufacturers and are stated at the lower of cost computed using the firstin firstout method or market value manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory in addition we also purchase certain strategic component inventory including integrated circuits which are consigned to our contract manufacturers we record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value 

we use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures these estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers product development plans and current sales levels if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control we may be required to increase our inventory writedowns and provisions for noncancelable nonreturnable purchase commitments which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 

warranty 

we offer a oneyear warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90day warranty against defects in any software embedded in the products we use judgment and estimates when determining warranty costs based on historical costs primarily to replace or repair product returns within the warranty period at the time we recognize revenue we accrue specifically identified reserves if and when we determine we have a systemic product failure historically we have identified specific products that failed in the field prematurely at higher than expected rates due to various component issues although we engage in extensive product quality programs if actual product failure rates or use of materials differ from estimates additional warranty costs may be incurred which could reduce our gross margin 

stockbased compensation 

compensation expense related to stockbased transactions including stock options restricted stock awards or rsas and stock purchase rights is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the awards granted the fair value of each stockbased award is estimated on the grant date using the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model the stockbased compensation expense net of forfeitures is recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service periods of the awards which is generally four years 

our use of the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the fair value of the underlying common stock the expected term of the option the expected volatility of the price of our common stock riskfree interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock the assumptions used in our optionpricing model represent management’s best estimates these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment if factors change and different assumptions are used our stockbased compensation expense could be materially different in the future 

these assumptions and estimates are as follows 

• fair value of common stock prior to our ipo we estimated the fair value of common stock based on numerous subjective and objective factors at each grant date 

• expected term the expected term represents the period that our option awards are expected to be outstanding we consider several factors in estimating the expected term of options granted including the expected lives used by a peer group of companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business and the historical option exercise behavior of our employees which we believe is representative of future behavior 

• expected volatility the volatility is derived from the average historical stock volatilities of a peer group of public companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stockbased grants we did not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers’ common stock because the volume of activity was low we intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies 

until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us in which case more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation 

• riskfree interest rate the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zerocoupon us treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the option’s expected term 

• dividend yield we have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future consequently we used an expected dividend yield of zero 

in addition to the assumptions used in the blackscholesmerton optionpricing model we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stockbased compensation expense for our awards our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover and other factors changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stockbased compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stockbased compensation on a prospective basis as we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock we may have refinements to our estimates which could materially impact our future stockbased compensation expense 

income taxes 

income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that we recognize for financial reporting and income tax purposes 

we account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements but have not been reflected in our taxable income estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards we measure deferred income tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize 

we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

loss contingencies 

we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability in determining loss contingencies we accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss we record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and investments in privately held companies 

foreign currency risk 

our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located which is primarily in the us and to a lesser extent in europe and asia our results of operations and cash flows are therefore subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates the effect of a 100 basis point hypothetical change in foreign currency exchanges rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements 

interest rate sensitivity 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents availableforsale marketable securities notes receivable and our indebtedness our cash and cash equivalents are held in cash deposits money market funds with maturities of less than 90 days from the date of purchase our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the us however because of the shortterm nature of the instruments in our portfolio a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 2094 million  invested in availableforsale marketable securities an immediate hypothetical change of 100 basis points to the interest rate would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows as of december 31 2013 we did not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 

investments in privately held companies 

we have invested in privately held companies in 2014 these investments are recorded in investments noncurrent in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using the cost method as of december 31 2014  the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was 336 million  some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these companies our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in including among other factors the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

management with the participation of our chief executive officer ceo and our chief financial officer cfo evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2014  the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2014  our ceo and cfo concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for 2013 we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to our inventory process that were not appropriately designed and implemented during the year specifically in conjunction with changes in our supply chain we did not appropriately capitalize the cost of freight incurred related to product shipped from our contract manufacturers to the distribution centers and we also did not appropriately capitalize the purchase price variance for inventory 

we have remediated the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting by implementing a number of measures designed to address the underlying causes of the material weakness these measures included hiring additional accounting and finance personnel with technical accounting and financial reporting experience enhancing and segregating duties within our accounting and finance department and enhancing our internal review procedures during the financial statement close process we believe that these additional resources and processes and procedures have enabled us to broaden the scope and quality of our controls relating to the oversight and review of financial statements and reconciliations and our application of relevant accounting policies 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

except for the remediation efforts described above there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by rule 13a15d and 15d15d of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended that occurred during the year ended december 31 2014  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  inherent limitations of internal controls 

our management including our ceo and cfo does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected
