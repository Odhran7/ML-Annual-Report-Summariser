marketing and customers 

we seek to build collaborative relationships with our customers to understand their unique opportunities and challenges by engaging with our customers early in the product lifecycle to identify and design features and performance characteristics into our products we are able to manufacture products that anticipate and address our customers’ changing needs collaborating with our customers on their design needs in changing end markets and meeting their timelines for qualifying new products allows us to differentiate our memory and storage solutions which provides greater value to our customers 

our semiconductor memory and storage products are offered under our micron and crucial brand names and through private labels we market our semiconductor memory and storage products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices to support our worldwide customer base our products are also offered through independent sales representatives distributors and retailers our independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and we then make shipments against these orders directly to customers or through our distributors our distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including our competitors’ products we sell our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products 

due to volatile industry conditions our customers are generally reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice purchase contracts we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that pricing quantity and other terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the time of shipment 

in each of the last three years approximately onehalf of our total revenue was from our top ten customers for other information regarding our concentrations and customers see “part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – certain concentrations” 

competitive conditions 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies including intel kioxia holdings corporation samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc and western digital corporation our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased manufacturing scale and a stronger product portfolio 

11  2022 10k 

in addition some governments may provide or have provided and may continue to provide significant assistance financial or otherwise to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries andor competitors in particular we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the chinese government and various stateowned or affiliated entities such as yangtze memory technologies co ltd “ymtc” and changxin memory technologies inc “cxmt” that is intended to advance china’s stated national policy objectives in addition the chinese government may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies 

we and our competitors generally seek to increase wafer output improve yields and reduce die size which could result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some of our competitors have plans to ramp or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have cost or performance advantages 

manufacturing 

we manufacture our products within our own facilities located in taiwan singapore japan the united states malaysia and china and also utilize subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day seven days per week semiconductor manufacturing is capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment our dram nand and nor products share a number of common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage our product and process technology and certain resources and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines 

our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex and involves numerous precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effectively deploying those techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth 3d nonvolatile layers nand cell levels process complexity including the number of mask layers and fabrication steps and manufacturing yield other factors include the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization cost of raw materials labor productivity package type cleanliness of our manufacturing environment and utilization of subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes as we continue to increase our production of high value products and solutions manufacturing costs are increasingly affected by the costs of applicationspecific integrated circuit asic controllers and other semiconductors advanced and complex packaging configurations and testing at progressively higher performance speeds and quality levels we continuously enhance our production processes increase bits per wafer transition to higher density products and utilize advanced testing and assembly processes 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highlycontrolled clean environment to minimize yield loss from contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may be scrapped due to equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects or contamination from airborne particles among other factors success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and improving process margin to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we continue to heighten quality control as our product offerings expand into higherend segments that require increasing performance targets 

our products are manufactured and sold in both packaged form and as unpackaged bare die our packaged products include packaged die memory modules and systemlevel solutions such as ssds managed nand and mcps we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases outsource assembly services for certain packaged die memory modules ssds and mcps we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow and perform high temperature burnin on finished products in addition we use our proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor die capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing and supply chain operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our costs can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume products and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 

resources 

supply chain materials and thirdparty service providers 

our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services we generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials components and services that meet our standards and in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single or sole source and we may be unable to qualify new suppliers on a timely basis the availability of materials or components such as chemicals silicon wafers gases photoresist controllers substrates lead frames printed circuit boards targets and reticle glass blanks is impacted by various factors these factors could include a shortage of raw materials or a disruption in the processing or purification of those raw materials into finished goods shortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components and may occur from time to time in the future constraints within our supply chain for certain materials and integrated circuit components could limit our bit shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with thirdparty manufacturers of controllers analog integrated circuits and other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor foundries assembly and test providers contract manufacturers logistics carriers and other service providers including providers of electricity and other utilities although we have certain longterm contracts with some of our suppliers many of these contracts do not provide for longterm capacity or pricing commitments to the extent we do not have firm commitments from our thirdparty suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity quantity andor pricing our suppliers may allocate capacity to their other customers and capacity andor materials may not be available when needed or at reasonable prices inflationary pressures and shortages have increased and may continue to increase costs for materials supplies and services regardless of contract structure large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply andor our suppliers’ capacity to meet those demand changes resulting in a shortage of parts materials or capacity needed to manufacture our products in addition if any of our suppliers was to cease operations or become insolvent this could impact their ability to provide us with necessary supplies and we may not be able to obtain the needed supply in a timely way or at all from other providers 

certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries including rare earth elements minerals and metals trade disputes geopolitical tensions economic circumstances political conditions or public health issues such as covid19 may limit our ability to obtain such materials although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers china is the predominant producer of certain of these materials if china were to restrict or stop exporting these materials our suppliers’ ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities or obtain supply in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost constrained supply of rare earth elements minerals and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from china 

13  2022 10k 

we andor our suppliers and service providers could be affected by regional conflicts sanctions tariffs embargoes or other trade restrictions as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change conflict minerals responsible sourcing practices public health crises contagious disease outbreaks or other matters which could limit the supply of our materials andor increase the cost environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials our ability to procure components to repair equipment essential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in supply chains among other items the disruption of our supply of materials components or services or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our inability to source materials supplies or thirdparty services could affect our overall production output and our ability to fulfill customer demand significant or prolonged shortages of our products could halt customer manufacturing and damage our relationships with these customers any damage to our customer relationships as a result of a shortage of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition similarly if our customers experience disruptions to their supplies materials components or services or the extension of their lead times they may reduce cancel or alter the timing of their purchases with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

risks related to our business operations and industry 

volatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products may adversely affect our business 

we have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices and may continue to experience such volatility in the future for dram annual percentage changes in average selling prices have ranged from plus or minus approximately 35 since 2017 for nand average selling prices have generally declined since 2017 with annual price declines ranging from approximately 10 to nearly 50 in some prior periods average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins 

our gross margins are dependent in part upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs factors that may limit our ability to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins include but are not limited to 

• strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix 

• increasing complexity of manufacturing processes 

• difficulties in transitioning to smaller linewidth process technologies or additional 3d memory layers or nand cell levels 

• process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps 

• manufacturing yield 

• technological barriers 

• changes in process technologies 

• new products that may require relatively larger die sizes 

• startup or other costs associated with capacity expansions and 

• higher costs of goods and services due to inflationary pressures or market conditions 

many factors may result in a reduction of our output or a delay in ramping production which could lead to underutilization of our production assets these factors may include among others a weak demand environment industry oversupply inventory surpluses difficulties in ramping emerging technologies supply chain disruptions and delays from equipment suppliers a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed and do not vary proportionally with changes in production output as a result lower utilization and corresponding increases in our per gigabit manufacturing costs may adversely affect our gross margins business results of operations or financial condition 

we have a broad portfolio of products to address our customers’ needs which span multiple market segments and are subject to rapid technological changes our manufacturing costs on a per gigabit basis vary across our portfolio as they are largely influenced by the technology node in which the solution was developed we strive to balance our demand and supply for each technology node but the dynamics of our markets and our customers can create periods of imbalance which can lead us to carry elevated inventory levels consequently we may incur charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventories or we may not fully recover our costs which would reduce our gross margins in addition due to the customized nature of certain of the products we manufacture we may be unable to sell certain finished goods inventories to alternative customers or manufacture inprocess inventory to different specifications which may result in excess and obsolescence charges in future periods 

in addition if we are unable to supply products that meet customer design and performance specifications we may be required to sell such products at lower average selling prices which may reduce our gross margins our gross margins may also be impacted by shifts in product mix driven by our strategy to optimize our portfolio to best respond to changing market dynamics 

our inability to maintain or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

the semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies including intel kioxia holdings corporation samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc and western digital corporation our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased manufacturing scale and a stronger product portfolio 

in addition some governments may provide or have provided and may continue to provide significant assistance financial or otherwise to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries andor competitors in particular we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the chinese government and various stateowned or affiliated entities such as ymtc and cxmt that is intended to advance china’s stated national policy objectives in addition the chinese government may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies 

we and our competitors generally seek to increase wafer output improve yields and reduce die size which could result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some of our competitors have plans to ramp or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have cost or performance advantages 

the competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business 

downturns in the worldwide economy due to inflation geopolitics major central bank policy actions including interest rate increases public health crises or other factors have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers smartphones automobiles and servers reduced demand for these or other products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales in addition to the extent our customers or distributors have elevated inventory levels we may experience a decrease in shortterm andor longterm demand resulting in industry oversupply and declines in pricing for our products 

a deterioration of conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit defaults as a result downturns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce new and competitive memory and storage technologies and products 

our key semiconductor memory and storage technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on stacking additional 3d memory layers increasing bits per cell ie cell levels meeting higher density requirements improving power consumption and reliability and delivering advanced features and higher performance we may face technological barriers to continue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate which has generally reduced per gigabit cost we have invested and expect to continue to invest in rd for new and existing products and process technologies such as euv lithography to continue to deliver advanced product requirements such new technologies can add complexity and risk to our schedule and may affect our costs and production output we may be unable to recover our investment in rd or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die size or increasing memory and storage densities our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance andor cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies 

we are developing new products including systemlevel memory and storage products and solutions which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have invested and expect to continue to invest in new semiconductor product and systemlevel solution development we are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands of our customers which increases our reliance on our customers’ ability to accurately forecast the needs and preferences of their customers as a result our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers in addition our ability to successfully introduce new products often requires us to make product specification decisions multiple years in advance of when new products enter the market 

it is important that we deliver products in a timely manner with increasingly advanced performance characteristics at the time our customers are designing and evaluating samples for their products if we do not meet their product design schedules our customers may exclude us from further consideration as a supplier for those products the process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality performance and reliability often well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers many factors may negatively impact our ability to meet anticipated timelines andor expected or required quality standards with respect to the development of certain of our products in addition some of our components have long leadtimes requiring us to place orders up to a year in advance of anticipated demand such long leadtimes increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand 

there can be no assurance of the following 

• we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies and products 

• we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products 

• we will be able to successfully market these technologies 

• margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 

• we will be able to establish or maintain key relationships with customers or that we will not be prohibited from working with certain customers for specific chip set or design requirements 

• we will accurately predict and design products that meet our customers specifications or 

• we will be able to introduce new products into the market and qualify them with our customers on a timely basis 

unsuccessful efforts to develop new memory and storage technologies and products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

25  2022 10k 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with a select number of customers 

in each of the last three years approximately onehalf of our total revenue was from our top ten customers a disruption in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our business we could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve our customers’ demand for our products may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control in addition any consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products may be sold our inability to meet our customers’ requirements or to qualify our products with them could adversely impact our revenue a meaningful change in the inventory strategy of our customers could impact our industry bit demand growth outlook the loss of or restrictions on our ability to sell to one or more of our major customers or any significant reduction in orders from or a shift in product mix by customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we face geopolitical and other risks associated with our international operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

in addition to our us operations a substantial portion of our operations are conducted in taiwan singapore japan malaysia china and india and many of our customers suppliers and vendors also operate internationally in 2022 nearly half of our revenue was from sales to customers who have headquarters located outside the united states while over 80 of our revenue in 2022 was from products shipped to customer locations outside the united states 

our international operations are subject to a number of risks including 

• export and import duties changes to import and export regulations customs regulations and processes and restrictions on the transfer of funds including currency controls in china which could negatively affect the amount and timing of payments from certain of our customers and as a result our cash flows 

• imposition of bans on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers 

• public health issues 

• compliance with us and international laws involving international operations including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended sanctions and anticorruption laws export and import laws and similar rules and regulations 

• theft of intellectual property 

• political and economic instability including the effects of disputes between china and taiwan and russia’s invasion of ukraine 

• government actions or civil unrest preventing the flow of products and materials including delays in shipping and obtaining products and materials cancellation of orders or loss or damage of products 

• problems with the transportation or delivery of products and materials 

• issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest 

• longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 

• compliance with trade technical standards and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions 

• contractual and regulatory limitations on the ability to maintain flexibility with staffing levels 

• disruptions to manufacturing or rd activities as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments 

• changes in economic policies of foreign governments and 

• difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 

if we or our customers suppliers or vendors are impacted by any of these risks it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition for example political economic or other actions may adversely affect our operations in taiwan a majority of our dram production output in 2022 was from our fabrication facilities in taiwan and any loss of output could have a material adverse effect on us any political economic or other actions may also adversely affect our customers and the technology industry supply chain for which taiwan is a central hub and as a result could have a material adverse impact on us 

in addition the us government has in the past restricted american firms from selling products and software to certain of our customers and may in the future impose similar restrictions on one or more of our significant customers these restrictions may not prohibit our competitors from selling similar products to our customers which may result in our loss of sales and market share even when such restrictions are lifted financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed with respect to our customers could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations and we may not be able to recover any customers or market share we lose or make such recoveries at acceptable average selling prices while complying with such restrictions 

our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by the limited availability and quality of materials supplies and capital equipment or dependency on thirdparty service providers 

our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services we generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials components and services that meet our standards and in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single or sole source and we may be unable to qualify new suppliers on a timely basis the availability of materials or components such as chemicals silicon wafers gases photoresist controllers substrates lead frames printed circuit boards targets and reticle glass blanks is impacted by various factors these factors could include a shortage of raw materials or a disruption in the processing or purification of those raw materials into finished goods shortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components and may occur from time to time in the future constraints within our supply chain for certain materials and integrated circuit components could limit our bit shipments which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with thirdparty manufacturers of controllers analog integrated circuits and other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor foundries assembly and test providers contract manufacturers logistics carriers and other service providers including providers of electricity and other utilities although we have certain longterm contracts with some of our suppliers many of these contracts do not provide for longterm capacity or pricing commitments to the extent we do not have firm commitments from our thirdparty suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity quantity andor pricing our suppliers may allocate capacity to their other customers and capacity andor materials may not be available when needed or at reasonable prices inflationary pressures and shortages have increased and may continue to increase costs for materials supplies and services regardless of contract structure large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply andor our suppliers’ capacity to meet those demand changes resulting in a shortage of parts materials or capacity needed to manufacture our products in addition if any of our suppliers was to cease operations or become insolvent this could impact their ability to provide us with necessary supplies and we may not be able to obtain the needed supply in a timely way or at all from other providers 

certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries including rare earth elements minerals and metals trade disputes geopolitical tensions economic circumstances political conditions or public health issues such as covid19 may limit our ability to obtain such materials although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers china is the predominant producer of certain of these materials if china were to restrict or stop exporting these materials our suppliers’ ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities or obtain supply in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost constrained supply of rare earth elements minerals and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from china 

we andor our suppliers and service providers could be affected by regional conflicts sanctions tariffs embargoes or other trade restrictions as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change conflict minerals responsible sourcing practices public health crises contagious disease outbreaks or other matters which could limit the supply of our materials andor increase the cost environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials our ability to procure components to repair equipment essential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in supply chains among other items the disruption of our supply of materials components or services or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

27  2022 10k 

our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers’ limited capacity our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production and could increase our overall costs of a ramp our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our construction projects to expand production and rd capacity are highly dependent on available sources of labor materials equipment and services increasing demand supply constraints inflation and other market conditions could result in increasing shortages and higher costs for these items difficulties in obtaining these resources could result in significant delays in completion of our construction projects and cost increases which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our inability to source materials supplies capital equipment or thirdparty services could affect our overall production output and our ability to fulfill customer demand significant or prolonged shortages of our products could halt customer manufacturing and damage our relationships with these customers any damage to our customer relationships as a result of a shortage of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

similarly if our customers experience disruptions to their supplies materials components or services or the extension of their lead times they may reduce cancel or alter the timing of their purchases with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the continued effects of the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the ongoing effects of the public health crisis caused by the covid19 pandemic and the measures being taken to limit covid19’s impact on our business results of operations and financial condition are uncertain and difficult to predict but may include and in some cases have included and may continue to include 

• disruptions to our supply chain and our operations or those of our suppliers especially as a result of public health measures including zerocovid policies in china or elsewhere 

• impacts to customer demand resulting in industry oversupply and declines in pricing for our products 

• adverse impacts to our business activities and increased costs from our efforts to mitigate the impact of covid19 

• increased costs for or unavailability of transportation raw materials components electricity andor other energy sources or other inputs necessary for the operation of our business 

• reductions in or cessation of operations at one or more of our sites or those of our subcontractors or suppliers resulting from government restrictions andor our own measures to prevent andor mitigate the spread of covid19 and 

• adverse impacts to our construction projects which could hamper our ability to introduce new technologies reduce costs or meet customer demand 

these effects and other impacts of the pandemic alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

increases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop qualify and manufacture our system solutions 

our development of systemlevel memory and storage products is dependent in part upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers’ specifications for those products developing and manufacturing systemlevel products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner even if our products meet customer specifications our sales of systemlevel solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices our competitors’ products may be less costly provide better performance or include additional features when compared to our products our longterm ability to sell systemlevel memory and storage products is reliant upon our customers’ ability to create market and sell their products containing our systemlevel solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner if we fail to successfully develop and market systemlevel products our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

manufacturing systemlevel solutions such as ssds and managed nand typically results in higher perunit manufacturing costs as compared to other products even if we are successful in selling systemlevel solutions to our customers in sufficient volume we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our perunit manufacturing costs are not offset by higher perunit selling prices manufacturing systemlevel solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle as compared to discrete products to design test and qualify which may increase our costs some of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications which increases our costs and time to market additionally we may need to update our controller and hardware design as well as our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications andor industry standards which increases our costs system complexities and extended warranties for systemlevel products could also increase our warranty costs our failure to costeffectively manufacture systemlevel solutions andor controller hardware design and firmware in a timely manner may result in reduced demand for our systemlevel products and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

products that fail to meet specifications are defective or are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application our products and solutions may be deemed fully or partially responsible for functionality in our customers’ products and may result in sharing or shifting of product or financial liability from our customers to us for costs incurred by the end user as a result of our customers’ products failing to perform as specified in addition if our products and solutions perform critical functions in our customers’ products or are used in highrisk consumer end products such as autonomous driver assistance programs home and enterprise security smoke and noxious gas detectors medical monitoring equipment or wearables for child and elderly safety our potential liability may increase we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

• we may be required or agree to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible products and to replace products 

• we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages and 

• we may encounter adverse publicity which could cause a decrease in sales of our products or harm our reputation or relationships with existing or potential customers 

any of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

if our manufacturing process is disrupted by operational issues natural disasters or other events our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we and our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the united states singapore taiwan japan malaysia and china as a result of the necessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities an operational disruption at one of our or a subcontractor’s facilities may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products 

from time to time there have been disruptions in our manufacturing operations as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment disruptions in supply of raw materials or components or equipment failures we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences and possible climate changes such as severe and variable weather and geological events resulting in increased costs or disruptions to our manufacturing operations or those of our suppliers or customers in addition climate change may pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities including increased extreme weather events that could result in supply delays or disruptions other events including political or public health crises such as an outbreak of contagious diseases like covid19 may also affect our production capabilities or that of our suppliers including as a result of quarantines closures of production facilities lack of supplies or delays caused by restrictions on travel or shipping events of the types noted above have occurred from time to time and may occur in the future as a result in addition to disruptions to operations our insurance premiums may increase or we may not be able to fully recover any sustained losses through insurance 

if production is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers’ requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs loss of revenue or damage to customer relationships any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

breaches of our security systems or products or those of our customers suppliers or business partners could expose us to losses 

we maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities we also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations in addition we process store and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees including sensitive personal information unauthorized persons employees former employees or other third parties may gain access to our facilities or technology infrastructure and systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information compromise confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns this risk is exacerbated as competitors for talent particularly engineering talent increasingly attempt to hire our employees through cyberattacks on technology infrastructure and systems unauthorized parties may obtain access to computer systems networks and data including cloudbased platforms the technology infrastructure and systems of our suppliers vendors service providers cloud solution providers and partners have in the past experienced and may in the future experience such attacks which could impact our operations cyberattacks can include ransomware computer denialofservice attacks worms supply chain attacks social engineering and other malicious software programs or other attacks including those using techniques that change frequently or may be disguised or difficult to detect or designed to remain dormant until a triggering event impersonation of authorized users and efforts to discover and exploit any design flaws “bugs” security vulnerabilities as well as intentional or unintentional acts by employees or other insiders with access privileges globally cyberattacks are increasing in number and the attackers are increasingly organized and wellfinanced or supported by state actors and are developing increasingly sophisticated systems to not only attack but also to evade detection in addition geopolitical tensions or conflicts may create a heightened risk of cyberattacks breaches of our physical security attacks on our technology infrastructure and systems or breaches or attacks on our customers suppliers or business partners who have confidential or sensitive information regarding us and our customers and suppliers could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers suppliers or employees is compromised 

our products are also targets for cyberattacks including those products utilized in cloudbased environments while some of our products contain encryption or security algorithms to protect thirdparty content or usergenerated data stored on our products these products could still be hacked or the encryption schemes could be compromised breached or circumvented by motivated and sophisticated attackers further our products contain sophisticated hardware and firmware and applications that may contain security vulnerabilities or defects in design or manufacture including “bugs” and other problems that could interfere with the intended operation of our products to the extent our products are hacked or the encryption schemes are compromised or breached this could harm our business by requiring us to employ additional resources to fix the errors or defects exposing us to litigation claims and harm to our reputation 

any of the foregoing security risks could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we must attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees 

to remain competitive we must attract retain and motivate executives and other highly skilled diverse employees as well as effectively manage succession for key employees competition for experienced employees in our industry is intense hiring and retaining qualified executives and other employees is critical to our business if our total compensation programs employment benefits and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive and inclusive our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be compromised 

at times we experience higher levels of attrition increasing compensation costs and more intense competition for talent across our industry to the extent we experience significant attrition and are unable to timely replace employees we could experience a loss of critical skills and reduced employee morale potentially resulting in business disruptions or increased expenses to address any disruptions additionally changes to immigration policies in the countries in which we operate as well as restrictions on travel due to public health crises or other causes may limit our ability to hire andor retain talent in or transfer talent to specific locations 

our inability to attract retain and motivate executives and other employees or effectively manage succession of key roles may inhibit our ability to maintain or expand our business operations 

we may not be able to achieve expected returns from capacity expansions 

we have announced our intent to expand our dram production capacity in the united states and we also make capital investments in projects outside the united states 

these expansions involve several risks including the following 

• capital expenditure requirements for capacity expansions during periods of relatively low free cash flow generation resulting from challenging memory and storage industry conditions 

• availability of necessary funding which may include external sources 

• ability to realize expected grants investment tax credits and other government incentives including through the us chips and science act of 2022 “chips act” and foreign state and local grants 

• potential changes in laws or provisions of grants investment tax credits and other government incentives 

• potential restrictions on expanding in certain geographies 

• availability of equipment and construction materials 

• ability to complete construction as scheduled and within budget 

• availability of the necessary workforce 

• ability to timely ramp production in a costeffective manner 

• increases to our cost structure until new production is ramped to adequate scale and 

• sufficient growth in customer demand to meet our increased output 

we invest our capital in areas that we believe best align with our business strategy and optimize future returns investments in capital expenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows significant judgment is required to determine which capital investments will result in optimal returns and we could invest in projects that are ultimately less profitable than those projects we do not select delays in completion and ramping of new production facilities or failure to optimize our investment choices could significantly impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital expenditures 

31  2022 10k 

any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our incentives from various governments are conditional upon achieving or maintaining certain performance obligations and are subject to reduction termination or clawback 

we have received and may in the future continue to receive benefits and incentives from national state and local governments in various regions of the world designed to encourage us to establish maintain or increase investment workforce or production in those regions these incentives may take various forms including grants loan subsidies and tax arrangements and typically require us to achieve or maintain certain levels of investment capital spending employment technology deployment or research and development activities to qualify for such incentives or could restrict us from undertaking certain activities we may be unable to obtain significant future incentives to continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and operating costs without which our cost structure would be adversely impacted we also cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve performance obligations required to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide such funding these incentive arrangements typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our compliance with their terms and obligations such audits could result in modifications to or termination of the applicable incentive program the incentives we receive could be subject to reduction termination or clawback and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

acquisitions andor alliances involve numerous risks 

acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 

• integrating the operations technologies and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations 

• increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities 

• increased debt levels 

• the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities 

• the use of cash to finance a transaction which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital capital expenditures rd expenditures and other business activities 

• diverting management’s attention from daily operations 

• managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas 

• hiring and retaining key employees 

• requirements imposed by government authorities in connection with the regulatory review of a transaction which may include among other things divestitures or restrictions on the conduct of our business or the acquired business 

• underestimating the costs or overestimating the benefits including product revenue cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize and we may not achieve those benefits 

• failure to maintain customer vendor and other relationships 

• inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls disclosure controls and procedures compliance programs andor environmental health and safety anticorruption human resource or other policies or practices and 

• impairment of acquired intangible assets goodwill or other assets as a result of changing business conditions or technological advancements 

the global memory and storage industry has experienced consolidation and may continue to consolidate we engage from time to time in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur restructure charges in future periods and may not realize expected savings or other benefits from restructure activities 

from time to time we have and may in the future enter into restructure initiatives in order to among other items streamline our operations respond to changes in business conditions our markets or product offerings or to centralize certain key functions we may not realize expected savings or other benefits from our restructure activities and may incur additional restructure charges or other losses in future periods associated with other initiatives in connection with any restructure initiatives we could incur restructure charges loss of production output loss of key personnel disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

compliance with responsible sourcing requirements and any related regulations could increase our operating costs or limit the supply and increase the cost of certain materials supplies and services and if we fail to comply customers may reduce purchases from us or disqualify us as a supplier 

we and many of our customers have adopted responsible sourcing programs that require us to meet certain esg criteria and to periodically report on our performance against these requirements including that we source the materials supplies and services we use and incorporate into the products we sell as prescribed by these programs many customer programs require us to remove a supplier within a prescribed period if such supplier ceases to comply with prescribed criteria and our supply chain may at any time contain suppliers at risk of being removed due to noncompliance with responsible sourcing requirements some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier resulting in a permanent or temporary loss of sales to such customer or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our performance or products including the underlying supply chain meet the specifications of our customers’ responsible sourcing programs on a continuous basis meeting responsible sourcing requirements may increase operating requirements and costs or limit the sourcing and availability of some of the materials supplies and services we use particularly when the availability of such materials supplies and services is concentrated to a limited number of suppliers from time to time we remove suppliers or require our suppliers to remove suppliers from their supply chains based on our responsible sourcing requirements or customer requirements and we or our suppliers may be unable to replace such removed suppliers in a timely or costeffective manner any inability to replace removed suppliers in a timely or cost effective manner may affect our ability andor the cost to obtain sufficient quantities of materials supplies and services necessary for the manufacture of our products our inability to replace suppliers we have removed in a timely or costeffective manner or comply with customers’ responsible sourcing requirements or with any related regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

failure to meet esg expectations or standards or achieve our esg goals could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition or stock price 

in recent years there has been an increased focus from stakeholders on esg matters including greenhouse gas emissions and climaterelated risks renewable energy water stewardship waste management diversity equality and inclusion responsible sourcing and supply chain human rights and social responsibility given our commitment to esg we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals commitments and targets which we may refine or even expand further in the future these goals commitments and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts to manage these issues report on them and accomplish our goals present numerous operational regulatory reputational financial legal and other risks any of which could have a material adverse impact including on our reputation and stock price 

such risks and uncertainties include 

• reputational harm including damage to our relationships with customers suppliers investors governments or other stakeholders 

• adverse impacts on our ability to sell and manufacture products 

• the success of our collaborations with third parties 

• increased risk of litigation investigations or regulatory enforcement action 

• unfavorable esg ratings or investor sentiment 

• diversion of resources and increased costs to control assess and report on esg metrics 

• our ability to achieve our goals commitments and targets within timeframes announced 

33  2022 10k 

• increased costs to achieve our goals commitments and targets 

• unforeseen operational and technological difficulties 

• access to and increased cost of capital and 

• adverse impacts on our stock price 

any failure or perceived failure to meet evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards or achieve our esg goals commitments and targets could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or stock price 

risks related to intellectual property and litigation 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property 

we maintain a system of controls over our intellectual property including us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets licensing arrangements confidentiality procedures nondisclosure agreements with employees consultants and vendors and a general system of internal controls despite our system of controls over our intellectual property it may be possible for our current or future competitors to obtain copy use or disclose illegally or otherwise our product and process technology or other proprietary information the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do us laws and our confidentiality nondisclosure and noncompete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce 

additionally our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract develop and retain highly skilled employees if our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees they may directly benefit from the knowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment and this may also negatively impact our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property 

our inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

legal proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

from time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business or otherwise both domestically and internationally such claims include but are not limited to allegations of anticompetitive conduct and infringement of intellectual property see “part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – contingencies” 

any claim with or without merit could result in significant legal fees that could negatively impact our financial results disrupt our operations and require significant attention from our management we may be associated with and subject to litigation claims or arbitration disputes arising from or as a result of 

• our relationships with vendors or customers supply agreements or contractual obligations with our subcontractors or business partners 

• the actions of our vendors subcontractors or business partners 

• our indemnification obligations including obligations to defend our customers against thirdparty claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights which may include patents trademarks copyrights or trade secrets and 

• the terms of our product warranties or from product liability claims 

as we continue to focus on developing system solutions with manufacturers of consumer products including autonomous driving augmented reality and others we may be exposed to greater potential for personal liability claims against us as a result of consumers’ use of those products we our officers or our directors could also be subject to claims of alleged violations of securities laws there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities and we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters exposures to various legal proceedings and claims could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend claims are required to pay damage awards or enter into settlement agreements any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

claims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon misappropriate misuse or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights we are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions made against us any of these types of claims regardless of the merits could subject us to significant costs to defend or resolve such claims and may consume a substantial portion of management’s time and attention as a result of these claims we may be required to 

• pay significant monetary damages fines royalties or penalties 

• enter into license or settlement agreements covering such intellectual property rights 

• make material changes to or redesign our products andor manufacturing processes andor 

• cease manufacturing having made selling offering for sale importing marketing or using products andor manufacturing processes in certain jurisdictions 

we may not be able to take any of the actions described above on commercially reasonable terms and any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see “part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – contingencies” 

we have a number of intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make onetime or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us the failure to obtain or renew licenses as necessary could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

risks related to laws and regulations 

government actions and regulations such as export restrictions tariffs and trade protection measures may limit our ability to sell our products to certain customers or markets or could otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations 

international trade disputes geopolitical tensions and military conflicts have led and continue to lead to new and increasing export restrictions trade barriers tariffs and other trade measures that can increase our manufacturing costs make our products less competitive reduce demand for our products limit our ability to sell to certain customers or markets limit our ability to procure or increase our costs for components or raw materials impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders impede our ability to perform rd activities or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations increasing protectionism economic nationalism and national security concerns may lead to further changes in trade policy domestic sourcing initiatives or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in or restrict our access to some markets andor customers 

35  2022 10k 

we cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to export regulations tariffs or other trade regulations between the united states and other countries what products or companies may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation further changes in trade policy tariffs restrictions on exports or other trade barriers or restrictions on supplies equipment and raw materials including rare earth minerals may limit our ability to produce products increase our selling andor manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies such changes may also result in reputational harm to us the development or adoption of technologies that compete with our products longterm changes in global trade and technology supply chains or negative impacts on our customers’ products which incorporate our solutions any of the effects described in this risk factor could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the technology industry is subject to intense media political and regulatory scrutiny which can increase our exposure to government investigations legal actions and penalties although we have policies controls and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors suppliers or agents will not violate such laws or our policies violations of trade laws restrictions or regulations can result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers directors or employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

taxrelated matters could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including changes in the geographic mix of our earnings among jurisdictions mandatory capitalization of rd expenses beginning in 2023 challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements expanding our operations in various countries fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates adverse resolution of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and changes in tax laws and regulations 

changes to income tax laws and regulations or the interpretation of such laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flows from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition beginning in 2024 the inflation reduction act of 2022 imposes a 15 book minimum tax on corporations with threeyear average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding 1 billion we are in the process of assessing whether the book minimum tax would impact our effective tax rate further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development if implemented by taxing authorities in countries where we do business such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we and others are subject to a variety of laws regulations or industry standards including with respect to esg considerations which may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the manufacture of our products requires the use of facilities equipment and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate additionally we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction maintenance and operations of our facilities any changes in laws regulations or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition any failure to comply with laws regulations or industry standards could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results additionally we engage various third parties as sales channel partners or to represent us or otherwise act on our behalf who are also subject to a broad array of laws regulations and industry standards our engagement with these third parties may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with laws and regulations 

new esg considerations including those related to climate change and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new laws regulations or industry standards that may affect us our suppliers and our customers such laws regulations or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

as a result of the items detailed in this risk factor we could experience the following 

• suspension of production or sales of our products 

• remediation costs 

• increased compliance costs 

• alteration of our manufacturing processes 

• regulatory penalties fines and legal liabilities and 

• reputational challenges 

compliance with or our failure or the failure of our thirdparty sales channel partners or agents to comply with laws regulations or industry standards could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

risks related to capitalization and financial markets 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments pay our dividend and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold average selling prices and manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technology support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rd and product and process technology we estimate capital expenditures in 2023 for property plant and equipment net of partner contributions will be around 8 billion 

in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our debt levels expected debt amortization and general capital market and other economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all we have experienced volatility in our cash flows and operating results and may continue to experience such volatility in the future which may negatively affect our credit rating our credit rating may also be affected by our liquidity financial results economic risk or other factors which may increase the cost of future borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows access capital or credit markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt payments pay our quarterly dividend and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition 

we have incurred in the past and expect to incur in the future debt to finance our capital investments business acquisitions and to realign our capital structure as of september 1 2022 we had debt with a carrying value of 691 billion and may incur additional debt including under our 250 billion revolving credit facility our debt obligations could adversely impact us as follows 

• require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund our business activities 

• adversely impact our credit rating which could increase future borrowing costs 

• limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures strategic acquisitions or business opportunities rd and other general corporate requirements 

37  2022 10k 

• restrict our ability to incur specified indebtedness create or incur certain liens and enter into saleleaseback financing transactions 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

• increase our exposure to rising interest rates from variable rate indebtedness and 

• result in certain of our debt instruments becoming immediately due and payable or being deemed to be in default if applicable cross default crossacceleration andor similar provisions are triggered 

our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows or obtain external financing in the future this to some extent is subject to market economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs additionally events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable drawdown conditions and utilize our revolving credit facility if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

across our global operations significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the euro malaysian ringgit singapore dollar new taiwan dollar and yen in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies exchange rates for some of these currencies against the us dollar have been volatile and may be volatile in future periods if these currencies strengthen against the us dollar our manufacturing costs could significantly increase exchange rates for the us dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to counterparty default risks 

we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash deposits investments and derivative instruments additionally we are subject to counterparty default risk from our customers for amounts receivable from them as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty will default on its performance obligations a counterparty may not comply with its contractual commitments which could then lead to its defaulting on its obligations with little or no notice to us which could limit our ability to mitigate our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings in the event of such default we could incur significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 

our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally we the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have on occasion experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to the specific operating performance of individual companies the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including but not limited to actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results changes in financial forecasts or estimates by us or financial or other market estimates and ratings by securities and other analysts changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public interest rate changes regulatory changes news regarding our products or products of our competitors and broad market and industry fluctuations 

for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future trading prices of our common stock financial condition results of operations or cash flows investors in our common stock may not realize any return on their investment in us and may lose some or all of their investment volatility in the trading price of our common stock could also result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

the amount and frequency of our share repurchases may fluctuate and we cannot guarantee that we will fully consummate our share repurchase authorization or that it will enhance longterm shareholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves 

the amount timing and execution of our share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase authorization may fluctuate based on our operating results cash flows and priorities for the use of cash for other purposes our expenditures for share repurchases were 243 billion in 2022 120 billion in 2021 176 million in 2020 and 266 billion in 2019 these other purposes include but are not limited to operational spending capital spending acquisitions and repayment of debt other factors including changes in tax laws could also impact our share repurchases although our board of directors has authorized share repurchases of up to 10 billion of our outstanding common stock the authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any common stock 

we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase authorization will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm shareholder value the repurchase authorization could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility and any announcement of a pause in or termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock in addition this program will diminish our cash reserves 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all 

our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common shares on a quarterly basis the declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our board of directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts or at all 

future dividends if any and their timing and amount may be affected by among other factors our financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions debt service obligations contractual restrictions industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock

results of operations 

consolidated results 



43  2022 10k 

total revenue total revenue for 2022 increased 11 as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in sales of both dram and nand products 

• sales of dram products increased 12 primarily due to increases in bit shipments of slightly over 10 

• sales of nand products increased 11 primarily due to a highsingledigit percent increase in bit shipments and a lowsingledigit percent increase in average selling prices 

in the fourth quarter of 2022 the memory and storage industry environment deteriorated sharply due to global and macroeconomic challenges combined with downward inventory adjustments by customers leading to significant reductions in bit shipments and average selling prices for both dram and nand resulting in a 23 decline in revenue as compared to the third quarter of 2022 for the first quarter of 2023 continuation of these challenging conditions and inventory adjustments by customers have resulted in further reductions in nearterm demand for both dram and nand and we expect bit shipments and pricing to decline as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 

total revenue for 2021 increased 29 as compared to 2020 primarily due to increases in sales of both dram and nand products 

• sales of dram products increased 38 primarily due to growth in bit shipments in the high20 range and a high singledigit percent increase in average selling prices 

• sales of nand products increased 14 primarily due to increases in bit shipments in the high20 range partially offset by a decline in average selling prices of slightly over 10 

consolidated gross margin  our consolidated gross margin percentage increased to 45 for 2022 from 38 for 2021 as a result of improvements in margins for both dram and nand products primarily due to reductions in manufacturing costs manufacturing cost reductions were driven by strong execution in ramping our 1α dram and 176layer nand technology nodes our consolidated gross margin percentage declined to 39 in the fourth quarter of 2022 from 47 in the third quarter of 2022 and we expect that in the first quarter of 2023 the percentage will decline further due to decreases in average selling prices as a result of the challenging industry environment for memory and storage products to address our elevated inventory levels and reduce supply growth in the first quarter of 2023 we are selectively reducing facility utilization in both dram and nand we also expect that inflationary pressure will continue to be a headwind to costs in the first quarter of 2023 

our consolidated gross margin percentage increased to 38 for 2021 from 31 for 2020 primarily due to the increases in dram average selling prices and cost reductions resulting from strong execution in delivering products featuring advanced technologies partially offset by declines in nand average selling prices our gross margins included the impact of underutilization costs at mtu of 335 million for 2021 and 557 million for 2020 underutilization costs at mtu declined in 2021 primarily due to the plan to sell mtu’s lehi facility and classification of assets as held for sale at the end of the second quarter of 2021 which resulted in the cessation of depreciation on those assets see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – lehi utah fab and 3d xpoint” 

effective as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2021 we changed our method of inventory costing from average cost to firstin firstout “fifo” concurrently as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2021 we modified our inventory cost absorption processes used to estimate inventory values which affects the timing of when costs are recognized these changes resulted in a onetime increase to cost of goods sold of approximately 293 million in 2021 

revenue by business unit 



percentages of total revenue may not total 100 due to rounding 

changes in revenue for each business unit for 2022 as compared to 2021 were as follows 

• cnbu revenue increased 12 primarily due to increases in bit shipments to cloud enterprise and networking markets 

• mbu revenue was relatively unchanged as both dram and nand revenue was relatively flat 

• ebu revenue increased 24 primarily due to strong demand growth in industrial and automotive markets 

• sbu revenue increased 15 primarily due to higher average selling prices and increases in shipments of ssd products 

changes in revenue for each business unit for 2021 as compared to 2020 were as follows 

• cnbu revenue increased 34 primarily due to broadbased increases in bit shipments across markets and higher average selling prices for dram 

• mbu revenue increased 26 primarily due to increases in bit shipments for highvalue mobile mcp products 

• ebu revenue increased 53 primarily due to increases in bit shipments driven by strong demand growth in automotive industrial and consumer markets and improved pricing in industrial and consumer markets 

• sbu revenue increased 6 as increases in bit shipments for nand products outpaced declines in average selling prices 

operating income loss by business unit 



percentages reflect operating income loss as a percentage of revenue for each business unit 

changes in operating income or loss for each business unit for 2022 as compared to 2021 were as follows 

• cnbu operating income increased primarily due to higher bit shipments and manufacturing cost reductions 

• mbu operating income was relatively unchanged as slight increases in gross margins were offset by higher operating expenses 

• ebu operating income increased primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions from an increasing mix of leadingedge bits higher bit shipments and improved dram pricing in industrial and consumer markets partially offset by higher rd expenses 

• sbu operating income increased primarily due to improved product mix driving increases in average selling prices increases in ssd shipments and manufacturing cost reductions partially offset by higher rd expenses 

45  2022 10k 

changes in operating income or loss for each business unit for 2021 as compared to 2020 were as follows 

• cnbu operating income increased primarily due to increases in bit shipments higher average selling prices manufacturing cost reductions and lower mtu underutilization costs 

• mbu operating income increased primarily due to increases in sales of highvalue mcp products manufacturing cost reductions for lowpower dram and increases in dram bit shipments 

• ebu operating income increased primarily due to improved pricing in industrial and consumer markets cost reductions from an increasing mix of leadingedge bits and higher bit shipments 

• sbu operating income increased primarily due to lower manufacturing costs and increases in bit shipments partially offset by decreases in selling prices and higher rd costs 

operating expenses and other 

research and development rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development and prequalification wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through internal reviews and tests for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 

rd expenses for 2022 increased 17 as compared to 2021 primarily due to higher employee compensation from increases in headcount higher volumes of development and prequalification wafers and higher depreciation expense rd expenses for 2021 increased 2 as compared to 2020 primarily due to increases in employee compensation and depreciation expense resulting from higher capital spending partially offset by lower volumes of development and prequalification wafers 

selling general and administrative sga expenses for 2022 were 19 higher as compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in employee compensation professional services and legal fees sga expenses for 2021 were relatively unchanged as compared to 2020 

restructure and asset impairments in the first quarter of 2022 we sold our lehi utah facility to ti in 2021 the lehi facility was classified as held for sale and we recognized a restructure charge of 435 million to write down the assets held for sale to the expected consideration to be received under our agreement with ti for further discussion see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – lehi utah fab and 3d xpoint” 

interest income expense  net interest expense for 2022 decreased by 53 million as compared to 2021 primarily due to an increase of 59 million in interest income as a result of increases in interest rates on our cash and investments net interest expense for 2021 increased by 66 million as compared to 2020 primarily due to a decrease of 77 million in interest income as a result of decreases in interest rates on our cash and investments 

income taxes our income tax provision benefit consisted of the following 

our effective tax rate increased in 2022 as compared to 2021 primarily due to the geographic mix of our earnings and a valuation allowance recorded against our idaho deferred tax assets of 189 million partially offset by tax impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates our effective tax rate decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily as a result of a 104 million tax benefit recorded for the discrete 435 million charge to write down the lehi assets held for sale 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the united states including singapore where we have tax incentive arrangements these incentives expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2034 and are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds the effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by 112 billion benefiting our diluted earnings per share by 100 for 2022 by 758 million 066 per diluted share for 2021 and by 215 million 019 per diluted share for 2020 

beginning in 2023 provisions in the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 will require us to capitalize and amortize rd expenditures rather than deducting the costs as incurred unless the effective date is deferred or the law is repealed we expect an increase to our effective tax rate for several years in addition the mix of our income together with us and foreign tax rules results in taxes becoming more fixed at lower profitability levels as a result of these factors we estimate tax expense of at least 300 million for 2023 beyond this level our actual tax expense will depend on the level of operating income through the year 

beginning in 2024 the inflation reduction act of 2022 imposes a 15 book minimum tax on corporations with threeyear average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding 1 billion we are in the process of assessing whether the book minimum tax would impact our effective tax rate 

various tax reforms are being considered in multiple jurisdictions that if enacted contain provisions that could increase our tax expense we continue to monitor the potential impact of these various tax reform proposals to our overall global effective tax rate and financial statements

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products which can vary significantly from period to period cash and marketable investments totaled 1098 billion as of september 1 2022 and 1040 billion as of september 2 2021 our cash and investments consist primarily of bank deposits money market funds and liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities which are diversified among industries and individual issuers to mitigate credit risk we invest through highcreditquality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor as of september 1 2022 379 billion of our cash and marketable investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries 

we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations we expect from time to time to engage in a variety of financing transactions for such purposes including the issuance of securities as of september 1 2022 250 billion was available to draw under our revolving credit facility funding of certain significant capital projects is also dependent on the receipt of government incentives which are subject to conditions and may not be obtained 

to develop new product and process technology support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and equipment and rd we estimate capital expenditures in 2023 for property plant and equipment net of partner contributions to be around 8 billion actual amounts for 2023 will vary depending on market conditions as of september 1 2022 we had purchase obligations of approximately 404 billion for the acquisition of property plant and equipment of which approximately 297 billion is expected to be paid within one year for a description of other contractual obligations such as debt leases and purchase obligations see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – debt” “ – leases” and “ – commitments”

to support expected memory demand in the second half of the decade we will need to add new dram wafer capacity following the enactment of the chips act in 2022 we announced plans to invest in two leadingedge memory manufacturing fabs in the united states contingent on chips act support through grants and investment tax credits as part of this plan in september 2022 we broke ground on a leadingedge memory manufacturing fab in boise idaho construction of the fab is expected to begin in calendar 2023 with dram production targeted to start in calendar 2025 in addition in october 2022 we announced plans to build a second leadingedge dram manufacturing fab in clay new york we plan to start site preparation work in calendar 2023 and expect construction to begin in calendar 2024 with production anticipated to ramp in the latter half of the decade we expect these new fabs to fulfill our requirements for additional wafer capacity starting in the second half of the decade and beyond in line with industry demand trends 

on november 1 2021 we issued 1 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured 2032 green bonds over time we plan to allocate an amount equal to the net proceeds to fund eligible sustainabilityfocused projects involving renewable energy green buildings energy efficiency water management waste abatement and a circular economy 

our board of directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to 10 billion of our outstanding common stock through openmarket purchases block trades privatelynegotiated transactions derivative transactions andor pursuant to rule 10b51 trading plans the repurchase authorization has no expiration date does not obligate us to acquire any common stock and is subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash through september 1 2022 we have repurchased an aggregate of 647 billion of the authorized amount see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – equity” 

on september 29 2022 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0115 per share payable in cash on october 26 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on october 11 2022 the declaration and payment of any future cash dividends are at the discretion and subject to the approval of our board of directors our board of directors decisions regarding the amount and payment of dividends will depend on many factors including but not limited to our financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions debt service obligations contractual restrictions industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 

we expect that our cash and investments cash flows from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

cash flows 



operating activities  cash provided by operating activities reflects net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation expense amortization of intangible assets asset impairments and stockbased compensation and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2022 as compared to 2021 was primarily due to higher net income adjusted for noncash items and the effect of lower receivables partially offset by an increase in inventories 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher net income adjusted for noncash items and the effect of lower inventories partially offset by an increase in receivables due to a higher level of sales

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions and involve a significant level of uncertainty we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

contingencies  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss if any from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in accounting for the resolution of contingencies significant judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods

goodwill  we test goodwill for impairment in our fourth quarter each year or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform the goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the reporting unit for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value goodwill is tested for impairment by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value we would record an impairment loss up to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value our qualitative assessment for the current year indicated that the fair value for all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value and that a quantitative assessment was unnecessary 

determining when to test for impairment the reporting units the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates forecasted manufacturing costs and other expenses and are developed as part of our longrange planning process the same estimates are used in business planning forecasting and capital budgeting as part of our longterm manufacturing capacity analysis we test the reasonableness of the output of our longrange planning process by calculating an implied value per share and comparing that to current stock prices analysts’ consensus pricing and management’s expectations these estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit which are discounted using a riskadjusted rate to estimate a fair value the discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

income taxes  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of the applicable year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income our income tax provision or benefit is dependent in part on our ability to forecast future taxable income in japan the united states malaysia and other jurisdictions such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve significant judgments including among others projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes manufacturing and overhead costs levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost being determined on a fifo basis effective as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2021 we changed our method of inventory costing from average cost to fifo cost includes depreciation labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining net realizable value of inventories involves significant judgments including projecting future average selling prices and future sales volumes to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information actual selling prices and volumes may vary significantly from projected prices and volumes due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory and storage markets when these analyses reflect estimated net realizable values below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when inventories are actually sold as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to costs of goods sold can vary significantly differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our inventory by approximately 337 million as of september 1 2022 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory and storage markets actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories we review the major characteristics of product type and markets in determining the unit of account for which we perform the lower of average cost or net realizable value analysis and categorize all inventories including dram nand and other memory as a single group 

property plant and equipment  we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment based on technology node transitions capital spending and equipment reuse rates we also review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimate of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require significant judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition significant judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

revenue recognition  revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods contracts with our customers are generally shortterm in duration at fixed negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery we estimate a liability for returns using the expected value method based on historical returns in addition we generally offer price protection to our distributors which is a form of variable consideration that decreases the transaction price we use the expected value method based on historical price adjustments and current pricing trends to estimate the amount of revenue recognized from sales to distributors differences between the estimated and actual amounts are recognized as adjustments to revenue

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio as of september 1 2022 and september 2 2021 we had fixedrate debt with an aggregate carrying value of 403 billion and 389 billion respectively and as a result the fair value of our debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates in 2022 we issued new debt and repaid other debt which significantly increased the average remaining maturity of our fixedrate debt resulting in increased variability of its fair value from interest rate changes we estimate that as of september 1 2022 and september 2 2021 a hypothetical 1 decrease in market interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 275 million and 200 million respectively 

interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio is managed by primarily investing in shorter term securities as of september 1 2022 a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our portfolio by approximately 30 million such impact would only be realized if investments were sold prior to maturity 

as of september 1 2022 and september 2 2021 we had floatingrate debt and fixedrate debt that is swapped to floatingrate debt with an aggregate principal amount of 209 billion a hypothetical 1 increase in the interest rates of this floatingrate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 21 million as of september 1 2022 and september 2 2021 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in “part i – item 1a risk factors” changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the functional currency for all of our operations is the us dollar the substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the us dollar however significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases and certain assets and liabilities are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro malaysian ringgit new taiwan dollar singapore dollar and yen we have established currency risk management programs for our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs which reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies we estimate that a hypothetical 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 186 million as of september 1 2022 and 122 million as of september 2 2021 we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within three months the effectiveness of our hedges is dependent among other factors upon our ability to accurately measure exposures on a timely basis to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs we may utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within two years see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – derivative instruments”

lehi utah fab and 3d xpoint 

in the second quarter of 2021 we updated our portfolio strategy to further strengthen our focus on memory and storage innovations for the data center market in connection therewith we determined that there was insufficient market validation to justify the ongoing investments required to commercialize 3d xpoint at scale accordingly we ceased development of 3d xpoint technology and engaged in discussions with potential buyers for the sale of our facility located in lehi that was dedicated to 3d xpoint production as a result we classified the property plant and equipment as held for sale and ceased depreciating the assets on june 30 2021 we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our lehi facility to ti for cash consideration of 900 million the sale is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2022 select tools and other equipment will be retained for redeployment to our other manufacturing sites or for resale to other buyers 

in the third quarter of 2021 we recognized a charge of 435 million included in restructure and asset impairments and a tax benefit of 104 million included in income tax provision benefit to write down the assets held for sale to

events surrounding the ongoing covid19 pandemic initially resulted in a reduction in economic activity across the globe and the timing and extent of the ongoing economic recovery remains uncertain as a result we have experienced volatility in the markets that our products are sold into driven by the move to a stayathome economy and fluctuations in consumer and business spending which has affected demand for certain of our products the ultimate extent to which covid19 will impact our business depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and very difficult to predict including the effectiveness and utilization of vaccines for covid19 and its variants the severity of covid19 and its variants and the effectiveness of the actions to contain or limit their spread 

from the start of the covid19 pandemic we proactively implemented preventative protocols which we continuously assess and update for changes in conditions and emerging trends these preventative protocols are intended to safeguard our team members contractors suppliers customers distributors and communities and to ensure business continuity government restrictions or severe outbreaks can impact our operations at certain sites while all our global manufacturing sites are currently operating with close to full staff and at normal capacity levels our facilities could be required to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates or our health and safety protocols we may be required or deem it to be in the best interest of our employees customers partners suppliers and stakeholders to alter our business operations in order to maintain a healthy and safe environment it is not clear what potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business including effects on our customers employees or on our financial results we are following government policies and recommendations designed to slow the spread of covid19 and remain committed to the health and safety of our team members contractors suppliers customers distributors and communities 

we continuously assess our efforts to respond to the covid19 pandemic which have included the following 

• in locations experiencing continued community covid19 infections we prohibit onsite visitors and are generally requiring team members to work from home where possible or practical where work from home is not possible all onsite team members must complete health questionnaires pass through thermal scanning equipment to ensure they do not have an elevated body temperature and adhere to physical distancing requirements mask protocols and team member separation protocols we have also enhanced our contact tracing significantly decreased business travel and where possible made ventilation and other health and safety enhancements at our facilities and provided covid19 testing and vaccinations for our team members 

• following the us food and drug administration’s recent approval of the pfizerbiontech covid19 vaccine we mandated that all us employees and in addition contractors that enter our us buildings and certain other locations be fully vaccinated against covid19 subject to disability and religious exemptions by november 15 2021 

• we continue to work closely with our customer base to best match our supply to changing market conditions 

• we evaluate our supply chain and communicate with our suppliers to identify supply gaps and have taken steps to provide continuity to the extent possible though we expect that constraints within our supply chain for certain ic components may somewhat limit our bit shipments in the near term in some cases we have added alternative suppliers and increased our onhand inventory of raw materials needed in our operations 

• we have added assembly and test capacity to provide redundant manufacturing capability through our network of captive operations and external partners 

• we have evaluated all our construction projects across our global manufacturing operations and enacted protocols to enhance the safety of our team members suppliers and contractors 

• we have developed strategies and implemented measures to respond to a variety of potential economic scenarios such as limitations on new hiring and business travel and reductions of discretionary spending 

• we are working with government authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate and continuing to monitor our operations in an effort to ensure we follow government requirements relevant regulations industry

8  2021 10k 

downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage we and our competitors generally seek to improve yields reduce die size in product designs or increase production capacity which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some of our competitors have plans to ramp or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have cost or performance advantages certain of our memory and storage products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors for these products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factor some of our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share or take business of our key customers 

some governments may provide or have provided and may continue to provide significant assistance financial or otherwise to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries andor competitors in particular we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the chinese government and various stateowned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance china’s stated national policy objectives in addition the chinese government may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies some of our competitors may benefit from policies and regulations that favor domestic companies or may not be subject to certain regulations or restrictions to which we are subject which may allow them access to certain sales opportunities from which we may be restricted in addition our customers may redirect their business to our competitors based on government policy national preference or other factors 

manufacturing 

we manufacture our products within our own facilities located in taiwan singapore japan the united states malaysia and china and also utilize subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day seven days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment our dram nand and nor products share a number of common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage our product and process technology and certain resources and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines 

our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex and involves numerous precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effectively deploying those techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth 3d nonvolatile layers nand cell levels process complexity including the number of mask layers and fabrication steps and manufacturing yield other factors include the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization cost of raw materials labor productivity package type cleanliness of our manufacturing environment and utilization of subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes as we continue to increase our production of high value products and solutions manufacturing costs are increasingly affected by the costs of applicationspecific integrated circuit asic controllers and other semiconductors advanced and complex packaging configurations and testing at progressively higher performance speeds and quality levels we continuously enhance our production processes increase bits per wafer transition to higher density products and utilize advanced testing and assembly processes 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highlycontrolled clean environment to minimize yield loss from contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may be scrapped due to equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects or contamination from airborne particles among other factors success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and improving process margin to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we continue 

to heighten quality control as our product offerings expand into higherend segments that require increasing performance targets 

our products are manufactured and sold in both packaged form and as unpackaged bare die our packaged products include packaged die memory modules and systemlevel solutions such as ssds managed nand and mcps we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases outsource assembly services for certain packaged die memory modules ssds and mcps we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow and perform high temperature burnin on finished products in addition we use our proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor die capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing and supply chain operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our costs can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume products and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 

resources 

supply chain materials and thirdparty service providers 

our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services we generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials and services that meet our standards and in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single or sole source various factors could impact the availability of materials or components such as chemicals silicon wafers gases photoresist controllers substrates lead frames printed circuit boards targets and reticle glass blanks shortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components and may occur from time to time in the future 

our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with thirdparty manufacturers of controllers analog integrated circuits and other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor foundries assembly and test providers contract manufacturers logistic carriers and other service providers although we have certain longterm contracts with some of our suppliers many of these contracts do not provide for longterm capacity commitments to the extent we do not have firm commitments from our thirdparty suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity andor quantity our suppliers may allocate capacity to their other customers and capacity andor materials may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices inflationary pressures and shortages may increase costs for materials supplies and services regardless of contract structure large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply andor our suppliers’ capacity to meet those demand changes in the required timeframe resulting in a shortage of parts materials or capacity needed to manufacture our products 

trade disputes or other political conditions economic conditions or public health issues such as covid19 may limit our ability to obtain materials necessary to produce micron products certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries including rare earth elements minerals and metals available primarily from china although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers china is the predominant producer of certain of these materials if china were to restrict or stop exporting these materials our suppliers’ ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities or obtain supply in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost constrained supply of rare earth elements minerals and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from china

risks related to our business operations and industry 

the effects of the covid19 pandemic could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the effects of the public health crisis caused by the covid19 pandemic and the measures being taken to limit covid19’s spread are uncertain and difficult to predict but may include and in some cases have included and may continue to include 

• a decrease in shortterm andor longterm demand andor pricing for our products and global economic volatility that could reduce demand andor pricing for our products resulting from the spread of covid19 andor the actions taken by governments businesses andor the general public in an effort to limit exposure to and the spread of covid19 such as travel restrictions quarantines and business shutdowns or slowdowns 

• negative impacts to our operations including 

◦ reductions in production levels rd activities product development technology transitions yield enhancement activities and qualification activities with our customers resulting from our efforts to mitigate the impact of covid19 through measures we have enacted at our locations around the world in an effort to protect our employees’ and contractors’ health and wellbeing including working from home limiting the number of meeting attendees reducing the number of people in certain of our sites at any one time quarantines of team members contractors or vendors who are at risk of contracting or have contracted covid19 and limiting employee travel 

◦ increased costs resulting from our efforts to mitigate the impact of covid19 through physicaldistancing measures working from home upgrades to our sites covid19 testing and vaccination enhanced cleaning measures and the increased use of personal protective equipment at our sites 

◦ increased costs business disruptions attrition andor reduced employee morale resulting from our mandate that all us employees and in addition contractors that enter our us buildings and certain other locations be fully vaccinated against covid19 subject to disability and religious exemptions by november 15 2021 as a condition of working for us 

◦ increased costs for or unavailability of transportation raw materials components electricity andor other energy sources or other inputs necessary for the operation of our business 

◦ reductions in or cessation of operations at any site or in any jurisdiction resulting from government restrictions on movement andor business operations or our measures to prevent andor mitigate the spread of covid19 at one or more of our sites such as we have experienced at some of our facilities from time to time since the start of the covid19 pandemic 

◦ our inability to continue or increased costs of construction projects due to delays in obtaining materials equipment labor engineering services government permits or any other essential aspect of projects which could impact our ability to introduce new technologies reduce costs or meet customer demand and 

◦ disruptions to our supply chain in connection with the sourcing and transportation of materials components equipment and engineering support and services from or in geographic areas that have been impacted by covid19 by efforts to contain the spread of covid19 or by followon effects on the worldwide supply chain 

18  2021 10k 

• deterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets that could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures result in losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties or result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit defaults 

while several covid19 vaccines have been approved and are available for use in the united states and certain other countries we are unable to predict how widely utilized the vaccines ultimately will be whether they will be effective in preventing the symptoms and spread of covid19 including its variant strains and when or if normal economic activity and business operations will resume 

these effects alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition the continuation of the pandemic or expanded or recurring outbreaks could exacerbate the adverse impact of such measures 

volatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products may adversely affect our business 

we have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices including dramatic declines as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such volatility in the future in some prior periods average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins 

our gross margins are dependent in part upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs including but not limited to process linewidth additional 3d memory layers additional bits per cell ie cell levels architecture number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and yield in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins factors that may limit our ability to maintain or reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes difficulties in transitioning to smaller linewidth process technologies or additional 3d memory layers or nand cell levels process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps manufacturing yield technological barriers changes in process technologies new products that may require relatively larger die sizes and startup or other costs associated with capacity expansion 

many factors may result in a reduction of our output or a delay in ramping production which could lead to underutilization of our production assets these factors may include among others a weak demand environment industry oversupply inventory surpluses difficulties in ramping emerging technologies declining selling prices and changes in supply agreements a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed and do not vary proportionally with changes in production output as a result lower utilization and corresponding increases in our per gigabit manufacturing costs may adversely affect our gross margins business results of operations or financial condition 

in addition per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by a broader product portfolio which may have smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles our business and the markets we serve are subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on enduser preferences as a result we may have work in process or finished goods inventories that could become obsolete or in amounts that are in excess of our customers’ demand consequently we may incur charges in connection with obsolete or excess 

inventories in addition due to the customized nature of certain of the products we manufacture we may be unable to sell certain finished goods inventories to alternative customers or manufacture inprocess inventory to different specifications which may result in excess and obsolescence charges in future periods our inability to maintain or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc kioxia holdings corporation and western digital corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage as our competitors may benefit from increased manufacturing scale and a stronger product portfolio in addition some governments may provide or have provided and may continue to provide significant assistance financial or otherwise to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries andor competitors in particular we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the chinese government and various stateowned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance china’s stated national policy objectives in addition the chinese government may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies some of our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share or take business of our key customers 

we and our competitors generally seek to increase wafer capacity improve yields and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some of our competitors have plans to ramp or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand could lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have cost or performance advantages 

the competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory and storage technologies 

our key semiconductor memory and storage products and technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on stacking additional 3d memory layers increasing bits per cell ie cell levels meeting higher density requirements and improving power consumption and reliability we may face technological barriers to continue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate which has generally reduced perunit cost we have invested and expect to continue to invest in rd for new and existing products and process technologies such as euv lithography to continue to deliver advanced product requirements such new technologies can add complexity and risk to our schedule and may affect our costs and production output we may be unable to recover our investment in rd or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die size or increasing memory and storage densities our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance andor cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies there can be no assurance of the following 

• that we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies 

• that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products 

• that we will be able to successfully market these technologies and 

• that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 

20  2021 10k 

we develop and produce advanced memory and storage technologies and there can be no assurance that our efforts to develop and market new product technologies will be successful unsuccessful efforts to develop new memory and storage technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with a select number of customers 

in each of the last three years approximately onehalf of our total revenue was from our top ten customers a disruption in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our business we could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve our customers’ demand for our products may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control in addition any consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products may be sold our inability to meet our customers’ requirements or to qualify our products with them could adversely impact our revenue a meaningful change in the inventory strategy of our customers particularly those in china could impact our industry bit demand growth outlook the loss of or restrictions on our ability to sell to one or more of our major customers such as occurred with our former customer huawei technologies co ltd “huawei” or any significant reduction in orders from or a shift in product mix by customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we face geopolitical and other risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

in 2021 56 of our revenue was from sales to customers who have headquarters located outside the united states we ship our products to the locations specified by our customers customers with global supply chains and operations may request we deliver products to countries where they own or operate production facilities or to countries where they utilize thirdparty subcontractors or warehouses as a result 89 of our revenue in 2021 was from products shipped to customer locations outside the united states 

a substantial portion of our operations are conducted in taiwan singapore japan malaysia china and india and many of our customers suppliers and vendors also operate internationally our operations and the global supply chain of the technology industry are subject to a number of risks including the effects of actions and policies of various governments across our global operations and supply chain for example political economic or other actions from china could impact taiwan and its economy and may adversely affect our operations in taiwan our customers and the technology industry supply chain in addition the us government has in the past restricted american firms from selling products and software to certain of our customers and may in the future impose similar bans or other restrictions on sales to one or more of our significant customers these restrictions may not prohibit our competitors from selling similar products to our customers which may result in our loss of sales and market share even when such restrictions are lifted financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed with respect to our customers could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations and we may not be able to recover any customers or market share we lose while complying with such restrictions 

our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

• export and import duties changes to import and export regulations customs regulations and processes and restrictions on the transfer of funds including currency controls in china which could negatively affect the amount and timing of payments from certain of our customers and as a result our cash flows 

• imposition of bans on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers 

• public health issues for example an outbreak of a contagious disease such as covid19 severe acute respiratory syndrome “sarscov” avian and swine influenza measles or ebola 

• compliance with us and international laws involving international operations including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended export and import laws and similar rules and regulations 

• theft of intellectual property 

• political and economic instability including the effects of disputes between china and taiwan 

• government actions or civil unrest preventing the flow of products including delays in shipping and obtaining products cancellation of orders or loss or damage of products 

• problems with the transportation or delivery of products 

• issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest 

• longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 

• compliance with trade technical standards and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions 

• contractual and regulatory limitations on the ability to maintain flexibility with staffing levels 

• disruptions to manufacturing or rd activities as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments 

• changes in economic policies of foreign governments and 

• difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 

if we or our customers suppliers or vendors are impacted by any of these risks it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by the limited availability and quality of materials supplies and capital equipment or dependency on thirdparty service providers 

our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services we generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials and services that meet our standards and in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single or sole source various factors could impact the availability of materials or components such as chemicals silicon wafers gases photoresist controllers substrates lead frames printed circuit boards targets and reticle glass blanks shortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components and may occur from time to time in the future as a result we expect that constraints within our supply chain for certain ic components may somewhat limit our bit shipments in the near term which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with thirdparty manufacturers of controllers analog integrated circuits and other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor foundries assembly and test providers contract manufacturers logistic carriers and other service providers although we have certain longterm contracts with some of our suppliers many of these contracts do not provide for longterm capacity commitments to the extent we do not have firm commitments from our thirdparty suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity andor quantity our suppliers may allocate capacity to their other customers and capacity andor materials may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices as mentioned in the preceding paragraph we are currently experiencing constraints within our supply chain for certain ic components inflationary pressures and shortages such as those the market is currently experiencing may increase costs for materials supplies and services regardless of contract structure large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply andor our suppliers’ capacity to meet those demand changes resulting in a shortage of parts materials or capacity needed to manufacture our products 

certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries including rare earth elements minerals and metals available primarily from china trade disputes or other political conditions economic conditions or public health issues such as covid19 may limit our ability to obtain such materials although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers china is the predominant producer of certain of these materials if china were to restrict or stop exporting these materials our suppliers’ ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities or obtain supply in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost constrained supply of rare earth elements minerals and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from china 

we andor our suppliers and service providers could be affected by tariffs embargoes or other trade restrictions as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change conflict minerals responsible sourcing practices public health crises contagious disease outbreaks or other matters which could limit the supply of our materials andor increase the cost environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials lead times for the supply of materials have been extended in the past our ability to procure components to repair equipment essential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in supply chains among other items the disruption of our supply of materials components or services or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition similarly if our customers experience disruptions 

22  2021 10k 

to their supplies materials components or services or the extension of their lead times they may reduce cancel or alter the timing of their purchases with us for example currently some pc customers are adjusting their memory and storage purchases due to shortages of nonmemory components that are needed to complete pc builds reduction cancellation or alteration of the timing of customer purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers’ limited capacity our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and could increase our overall costs of a ramp our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our construction projects to expand production and rd capacity are highly dependent on available sources of labor materials equipment and services increasing demand supply constraints inflation and other market conditions could result in increasing shortages and higher costs for these items difficulties in obtaining these resources could result in significant delays in completion of our construction projects and cost increases which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our inability to source materials supplies capital equipment or thirdparty services could affect our overall production output and our ability to fulfill customer demand significant or prolonged shortages of our products could halt customer manufacturing and damage our relationships with these customers for example recently several automotive manufacturers have experienced shortages of nonmemory semiconductorbased components from other suppliers forcing a curtailment of production lines any damage to our customer relationships as a result of a shortage of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

new product and market development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products including systemlevel memory and storage products and solutions which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technology and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product and systemlevel solution development over the next several years additionally we are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands of our customers which increases our reliance on our customers’ ability to accurately forecast the needs and preferences of their customers as a result our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers 

it is important that we deliver products in a timely manner with increasingly advanced performance characteristics at the time our customers are designing and evaluating samples for their products if we do not meet their product design schedules our customers may exclude us from further consideration as a supplier for those products the process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality performance and reliability often well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers the effects of the public health crisis caused by the covid19 pandemic and the measures being taken to limit covid19’s spread has negatively impacted and could in the future negatively impact our ability to meet anticipated timelines andor expected or required quality standards with respect to the development of certain of our products in addition some of our components have long leadtimes requiring us to place orders up to a year in advance of anticipated demand such long leadtimes increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand there can be no assurance that 

• our product development efforts will be successful 

• we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products 

• we will be able to successfully market these products 

• we will be able to establish or maintain key relationships with customers or that we will not be prohibited from working with certain customers for specific chip set or design requirements 

• we will be able to introduce new products into the market and qualify them with our customers on a timely basis or 

• margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 

our unsuccessful efforts to develop new products and solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

increases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop and qualify our system solutions 

our development of systemlevel memory and storage products is dependent in part upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers’ specifications for those products developing and manufacturing systemlevel products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner if we fail to identify or develop products on a timely basis or at all that comply with our customers’ specifications or achieve design wins with our customers we may experience a significant adverse impact on our revenue and margins even if our products meet customer specifications our sales of systemlevel solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices our competitors’ products may be less costly provide better performance or include additional features when compared to our products our longterm ability to sell systemlevel memory and storage products is reliant upon our customers’ ability to create market and sell their products containing our systemlevel solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner if we fail to successfully develop and market systemlevel products our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

even if we are successful in selling systemlevel solutions to our customers in sufficient volume we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our perunit manufacturing costs exceed our perunit selling prices manufacturing systemlevel solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle as compared to discrete products to design test and qualify which may increase our costs some of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications which increases our costs and time to market additionally we may need to update our controller and hardware design as well as our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications andor industry standards which increases our costs system complexities and extended warranties for systemlevel products could also increase our warranty costs our failure to costeffectively manufacture systemlevel solutions andor controller hardware design and firmware in a timely manner may result in reduced demand for our systemlevel products and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

products that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application our products and solutions may be deemed fully or partially responsible for functionality in our customers’ products and may result in sharing or shifting of product or financial liability from our customers to us for costs incurred by the end user as a result of our customers’ products failing to perform as specified in addition if our products and solutions perform critical functions in our customers’ products or are used in highrisk consumer end products such as autonomous driver assistance programs home and enterprise security smoke and noxious gas detectors medical monitoring equipment or wearables for child and elderly safety our potential liability may increase we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

• we may be required or agree to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible products and to replace products 

• we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages and 

24  2021 10k 

• we may encounter adverse publicity which could cause a decrease in sales of our products or harm our reputation or relationships with existing or potential customers 

any of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our manufacturing process is disrupted by operational issues natural disasters or other events our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we and our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the united states singapore taiwan japan malaysia and china as a result of the necessary interdependence within our network of manufacturing facilities an operational disruption at one of our or a subcontractor’s facilities may have a disproportionate impact on our ability to produce many of our products 

from time to time there have been disruptions in our manufacturing operations as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment disruptions in supply of raw materials or components or equipment failures we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences and possible climate changes such as severe and variable weather and geological events including droughts earthquakes tsunamis or other occurrences such as the recent taiwan drought that could disrupt operations resulting in increased costs or disruptions to our or our suppliers’ or customers’ manufacturing operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations other events including political or public health crises such as an outbreak of contagious diseases like covid19 sarscov avian and swine influenza measles or ebola may also affect our production capabilities or that of our suppliers including as a result of quarantines closures of production facilities lack of supplies or delays caused by restrictions on travel or shipping for example previously in response to increasing positive cases of covid19 in johor state malaysia we reduced our workforce onsite at our muar facility which reduced output levels from that facility though it is now operating at normal levels in addition climate change may pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities including increased extreme weather events that could result in supply delays or disruptions the events noted above have occurred from time to time and may occur in the future as a result in addition to disruptions to operations our insurance premiums may increase or we may not be able to fully recover any sustained losses through insurance 

if production is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers’ requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs loss of revenue or damage to customer relationships any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

breaches of our security systems or those of our customers suppliers or business partners could expose us to losses 

we maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities we also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations in addition we process store and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees including sensitive personal information unauthorized persons or employees may gain access to our facilities or network systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information compromise confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns including through cyberattacks these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities breaches of our physical security attacks on our network systems or breaches or attacks on our customers suppliers or business partners who have confidential or sensitive information regarding us and our customers and suppliers could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers suppliers or employees is compromised the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we must attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees 

to remain competitive we must attract retain and motivate executives and other highly skilled diverse employees as well as effectively manage or plan for succession for key employees competition for experienced employees in our industry continues to be intense hiring and retaining qualified executives engineers technical staff sales representatives and other employees is critical to our business if other employers are perceived as offering a greater degree of workplace flexibility or other employment benefits to employees than us we may experience difficulty in attracting retaining and motivating the employees needed for our business operations our inability to attract retain and motivate executives and other employees or effectively manage or plan for succession of key employees may inhibit our ability to maintain or expand our business operations in september 2021 we mandated that all us employees and in addition contractors that enter our us buildings and certain other locations be fully vaccinated against covid19 subject to disability and religious exemptions by november 15 2021 as a condition of working for us which could result in increased attrition loss of critical skills and reduced employee morale potentially resulting in business disruptions or increased expenses to address any disruptions additionally changes to immigration policies in the numerous countries in which we operate including the united states as well as restrictions on global travel as a result of local or global public health crises requiring quarantines or other precautions to limit exposure to infectious diseases may limit our ability to hire andor retain talent in or transfer talent to specific locations if our total compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive and inclusive our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our incentives from various governments are conditional upon achieving or maintaining certain performance obligations and are subject to reduction termination or clawback 

we have received and may in the future continue to receive benefits and incentives from national state and local governments in various regions of the world designed to encourage us to establish maintain or increase investment workforce or production in those regions these incentives may take various forms including grants loan subsidies and tax arrangements and typically require us to perform or maintain certain levels of investment capital spending employment technology deployment or research and development activities to qualify for such incentives we may be unable to obtain significant future incentives to continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and operating costs without which our cost structure would be adversely impacted we also cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve performance obligations required to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide such funding these incentive arrangements typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our compliance with their terms and obligations such audits could result in modifications to or termination of the applicable incentive program the incentives we receive could be subject to reduction termination or clawback and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may make future acquisitions andor alliances which involve numerous risks 

acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 

• integrating the operations technologies and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations 

• increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities 

• increased debt levels 

• the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities 

• the use of cash to finance a transaction which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital capital expenditures rd expenditures and other business activities 

• diverting management’s attention from daily operations 

• managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas 

• hiring and retaining key employees

risks related to laws and regulations 

increases in tariffs or other trade restrictions or taxes on our or our customers’ products or equipment and supplies could have an adverse impact on our operations 

in 2021 89 of our revenue was from products shipped to customer locations outside the united states we also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside the united states additionally a significant portion of our facilities are located outside the united states including in taiwan singapore japan malaysia and china 

the united states and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods general trade tensions between the united states and china have been escalating since 2018 with us tariffs on chinese goods and retaliatory chinese tariffs on us goods some of our products are included in these tariffs higher duties on existing tariffs and further rounds of tariffs have been announced or threatened by us and chinese leaders additionally the united states has threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from other countries which could also impact certain of our customers’ or our operations if the united states were to impose current or additional tariffs on components that we or our suppliers source our cost for such components would increase we may also incur increases in manufacturing costs and supply chain risks due to our efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and our operations additionally tariffs on our customers’ products could impact their sales of such end products resulting in lower demand for our products 

we cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the united states and other countries what products may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation further changes in trade policy tariffs additional taxes restrictions on exports or other trade barriers or restrictions on supplies equipment and raw materials including rare earth minerals may limit our ability to produce products increase our selling andor manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

trade regulations have restricted our ability to sell our products to several customers could restrict our ability to sell our products to other customers or in certain markets or could otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations 

international trade disputes have led and may continue to lead to new and increasing trade barriers and other protectionist measures that can increase our manufacturing costs make our products less competitive reduce demand for our products limit our ability to sell to certain customers or markets limit our ability to procure components or raw materials impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders impede our ability to perform rd activities or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations increasing protectionism economic nationalism and national security concerns may lead to further changes in trade policy domestic sourcing initiatives or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in or restrict our access to some markets andor customers 

escalating tensions between the united states and china have led to increased trade restrictions and have affected customer ordering patterns for example the us bureau of industry and security “bis” has enacted increasingly broad trade restrictions with respect to huawei which represented approximately 10 of our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 culminating with restrictions that took effect on september 15 2020 and that prevent us and many other companies from shipping products to huawei we cannot predict the duration these restrictions will remain in place whether the bis will grant us or others licenses to ship products to huawei or whether the bis or other us or foreign government entities will enact similar restrictions with respect to other customers markets or products we may not be able to replace the lost revenue opportunities associated with such restrictions 

the united states has also imposed other restrictions on the export of us regulated products and technology to certain chinese technology companies including certain of our customers these restrictions have reduced our sales and continuing or future restrictions could adversely affect our financial results result in reputational harm to us due to our relationship with such companies or lead such companies to develop or adopt technologies that compete with our products it is difficult to predict what further traderelated actions governments may take and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to such actions for example us legislation has expanded the power of the us department of commerce to restrict the export of “emerging and foundational technologies” yet to be identified which could impact our current or future products 

trade disputes and protectionist measures or continued uncertainty about such matters could result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession and could cause our customers to reduce cancel or alter the timing of their purchases with us sustained trade tensions could lead to longterm changes in global trade and technology supply chains which could adversely affect our business and growth prospects trade restrictions that may be imposed by the united states china or other countries may impact our business in ways we cannot reasonably quantify including that some of our customers’ products which incorporate our solutions may also be impacted in addition further increases in trade restrictions or barriers may negatively impact our revenue and any licenses we have received or could receive in the future could be rendered ineffective any such changes may have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the technology industry is subject to intense media political and regulatory scrutiny which can increase our exposure to government investigations legal actions and penalties although we have policies controls and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors suppliers or agents will not violate such laws or our policies violations of trade laws restrictions or regulations can result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers directors or employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

we operate in a number of locations outside the united states including singapore where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the geographic mix of our earnings among these jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements expanding our operations in various countries and changes in tax laws and regulations additionally we file income tax returns with the us federal government various us states and various other jurisdictions throughout the world and certain tax returns may remain open to examination for several years the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a change in tax laws in key jurisdictions could materially increase our tax expense 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions changes to income tax laws and regulations or the interpretation of such laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flows from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition for example our effective tax rate increased from 12 for 2018 to 98 for 2019 primarily as a result of tax reform by the united states additionally various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative actions to increase tax revenue the current administration has various proposals that if enacted would increase us federal income taxes on corporations further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development which represents a coalition of member countries and recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles if implemented by taxing authorities such changes as well as changes in us federal and state tax laws or in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

we and others are subject to a variety of laws regulations or industry standards including with respect to climate change that may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the manufacturing of our products requires the use of facilities equipment and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate additionally we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction maintenance and operations of our facilities any changes in laws regulations or industry standards could cause us to incur additional direct costs as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition any failure to comply with laws regulations or industry standards could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results additionally we engage various third parties as sales channel partners or to represent us or otherwise act on our behalf who are also subject to a broad array of laws regulations and industry standards our engagement with these third parties may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with laws and regulations 

climate change concerns and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new environmental health and safety laws and regulations that may affect us our suppliers and our customers such laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us these costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

as a result of the items detailed in this risk factor we could experience the following 

• suspension of production or sales of our products 

• remediation costs 

• alteration of our manufacturing processes 

• regulatory penalties fines and legal liabilities and 

• reputational challenges 

compliance with or our failure or the failure of our thirdparty sales channel partners or agents to comply with laws regulations or industry standards could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

risks related to capitalization and financial markets 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments pay our dividend and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold average selling prices and manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technology support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rd and product and process technology 

we estimate capital expenditures in 2022 for property plant and equipment net of partner contributions will be between approximately 11 billion and 12 billion investments in capital expenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows in addition we invest our capital in areas that we believe best align with our business strategy and will yield future profitability significant judgment is required to determine which capital investments will result in optimal returns and we could invest in projects that are ultimately less profitable than those projects we do not select delays in completion and ramping of new production facilities or failure to optimize our investment choices could significantly impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our debt levels expected debt amortization and general economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all we have experienced volatility in our cash flows and operating results and may continue to experience such volatility in the future which may negatively affect our credit rating our credit rating may also be affected by 

our liquidity financial results economic risk or other factors which may increase the cost of future borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or at all there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows access capital or credit markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt payments pay our quarterly dividend and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition 

we have incurred in the past and expect to incur in the future debt to finance our capital investments business acquisitions and restructure of our capital structure as of september 2 2021 we had debt with a carrying value of 678 billion and 250 billion of our revolving credit facility was available to us our debt obligations could adversely impact us as follows 

• require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions rd expenditures payment of dividends and other business activities 

• result in certain of our debt instruments being accelerated to be immediately due and payable or being deemed to be in default if certain terms of default are triggered such as applicable cross payment default andor crossacceleration provisions 

• adversely impact our credit rating which could increase future borrowing costs 

• limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures strategic acquisitions or business opportunities rd and other general corporate requirements 

• restrict our ability to incur specified indebtedness create or incur certain liens and enter into saleleaseback financing transactions 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory and storage industry conditions and 

• increase our exposure to interest rate risk from variable rate indebtedness 

our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows or obtain external financing in the future this to some extent is subject to market economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs additionally events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable drawdown conditions and utilize our revolving credit facility if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

across our global operations significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the euro malaysian ringgit singapore dollar new taiwan dollar and yen in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies exchange rates for some of these currencies against the us dollar have been volatile and may be volatile in future periods if these currencies strengthen against the us dollar our manufacturing costs could significantly increase exchange rates for the us dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to counterparty default risks 

we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash deposits investments and derivative instruments additionally we are subject to counterparty default risk from our customers for amounts receivable from them as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty will default on its performance obligations a counterparty may not comply with its contractual commitments which could 

34  2021 10k 

then lead to its defaulting on its obligations with little or no notice to us which could limit our ability to mitigate our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty’s default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings in the event of such default we could incur significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 

our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future additionally we the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have on occasion experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to the specific operating performance of individual companies the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including but not limited to actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results changes in financial estimates by us or financial or other market estimates and ratings by securities and other analysts changes in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public interest rate changes regulatory changes news regarding our products or products of our competitors and broad market and industry fluctuations 

our operating results have fluctuated in the past and will continue to do so sometimes materially many of the matters discussed in this risk factors section could impact our operating results in any fiscal quarter or year if our operating results fall below our forecasts and the expectations of public market analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock may decline 

for these reasons investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future trading prices of our common stock financial condition results of operations or cash flows investors in our common stock may not realize any return on their investment in us and may lose some or all of their investment volatility in the trading price of our common stock could also result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources 

the amount and frequency of our share repurchases may fluctuate and we cannot guarantee that we will fully consummate our share repurchase authorization or that it will enhance longterm shareholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves 

the amount timing and execution of our share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase authorization may fluctuate based on our operating results cash flows and priorities for the use of cash for other purposes for example we repurchased 664 million shares for 266 billion in 2019 36 million shares for 176 million in 2020 and 156 million shares for 120 billion in 2021these other purposes include but are not limited to operational spending capital spending acquisitions and repayment of debt other factors including changes in tax laws could also impact our share repurchases although our board of directors has authorized share repurchases of up to 10 billion of our outstanding common stock the authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any common stock 

we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase authorization will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm shareholder value the repurchase authorization could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility and any announcement of a pause in or termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock in addition this program will diminish our cash reserves 

there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all 

our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common shares on a quarterly basis the declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our board of directors and our dividend may be discontinued or reduced at any time there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends in the future in any particular amounts or at all 

future dividends if any and their timing and amount may be affected by among other factors our financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions debt service obligations contractual restrictions industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant a reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock

results of operations 

consolidated results 



total revenue  total revenue for 2021 increased 29 as compared to 2020 primarily due to increases in dram and nand sales sales of dram products for 2021 increased 38 as compared to 2020 primarily due to growth in 

bit shipments in the high20 range and a high singledigit percent increase in average selling prices sales of nand products for 2021 increased 14 as compared to 2020 primarily due to increases in bit shipments in the high20 range partially offset by a low10 range decline in average selling prices in the first quarter of 2022 we expect that our bit shipments may be adversely impacted as some customers are adjusting their memory and storage purchases due to shortages of nonmemory components and due to constraints within our supply chain for certain ic components 

total revenue for 2020 decreased 8 as compared to 2019 primarily due to a decline in dram sales partially offset by an increase in nand sales sales of dram products for 2020 decreased 14 as compared to 2019 as average selling prices declined in the mid30 range due to challenging market conditions partially offset by growth in bit shipments in the low30 range driven by cloud server enterprise server and mobile markets sales of nand products for 2020 increased 14 as compared to 2019 primarily due to increases in bit shipments in the mid20 range driven by sales of ssds to data center customers and sales of managed nand products partially offset by a highsingledigit percent decline in average selling prices 

overall gross margin  our overall gross margin percentage increased to 38 for 2021 from 31 for 2020 primarily due to the increases in dram average selling prices and cost reductions resulting from strong execution in delivering products featuring advanced technologies partially offset by the declines in nand average selling prices our gross margins included the impact of underutilization costs at mtu of 335 million for 2021 557 million for 2020 and 384 million for 2019 underutilization costs at mtu declined in 2021 primarily due to the plan to sell mtu’s lehi facility and classification of assets as held for sale at the end of the second quarter of 2021 which resulted in the cessation of depreciation on those assets see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – lehi utah fab and 3d xpoint” effective as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2021 we changed our method of inventory costing from average cost to firstin firstout “fifo” concurrently as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2021 we modified our inventory cost absorption processes used to estimate inventory values which affects the timing of when costs are recognized these changes resulted in a onetime increase to cost of goods sold of approximately 293 million in 2021 

our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 31 for 2020 from 46 for 2019 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by the effect of decreases in noncash depreciation expense from the revision in estimated useful lives of equipment in our nand wafer fabrication facilities cost reductions resulting from strong execution in delivering products featuring advanced technologies and continuous improvement initiatives to reduce production costs based on our assessment of planned technology node transitions capital spending and reuse rates we revised the estimated useful lives of the existing equipment in our nand wafer fabrication facilities and our research and development facilities from five years to seven years as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2020 the revision in estimated useful lives reduced nand manufacturing depreciation expense and benefited cost of goods sold by approximately 400 million for 2020 

revenue by business unit 



percentages of total revenue may not total 100 due to rounding 

changes in revenue for each business unit for 2021 as compared to 2020 were as follows 

• cnbu revenue increased 34 primarily due to broadbased increases in bit shipments across markets and higher average selling prices for dram 

• mbu revenue increased 26 primarily due to increases in bit shipments for highvalue mobile mcp products 

40  2021 10k 

• sbu revenue increased 6 as increases in bit shipments for nand products outpaced declines in average selling prices 

• ebu revenue increased 53 primarily due to increases in bit shipments driven by strong demand growth in automotive industrial and consumer markets and improved pricing in industrial and consumer markets 

changes in revenue for each business unit for 2020 as compared to 2019 were as follows 

• cnbu revenue decreased 8 primarily due to dram price declines driven by imbalances in supply and demand partially offset by bit sales growth across key markets particularly in the cloud server and graphics markets in addition in the second quarter of 2020 we determined that the 3d xpoint technology and product roadmap were more closely aligned with our cnbu strategy than our sbu strategy and 3d xpoint became an integral part of cnbu accordingly we began to report all 3d xpoint activities within cnbu from that date 

• mbu revenue decreased 11 primarily due to price declines partially offset by bit sales growth for highvalue mobile mcp products 

• sbu revenue decreased 2 primarily due to the decline in 3d xpoint revenue in sbu after the first quarter of 2020 as noted above and nand selling price declines partially offset by bit sales growth for ssds sbu revenue included products manufactured and sold to intel under a longterm supply agreement at prices approximating cost which included 3d xpoint memory and nand aggregating 124 million for 2020 and 682 million for 2019 

• ebu revenue decreased 12 primarily due to price declines resulting from the impact of the global covid19 pandemic on automotive industrial and consumer segments partially offset by bit sales growth from transitions to an increasing mix of highdensity dram and nand products 

operating income loss by business unit 



percentages reflect operating income loss as a percentage of revenue for each business unit 

changes in operating income or loss for each business unit for 2021 as compared to 2020 were as follows 

• cnbu operating income increased primarily due to increases in bit shipments higher average selling prices manufacturing cost reductions and lower mtu underutilization costs 

• mbu operating income increased primarily due to increases in sales of highvalue mcp products manufacturing cost reductions for lowpower dram and increases in dram bit shipments 

• sbu operating income increased primarily due to lower manufacturing costs and increases in bit shipments partially offset by decreases in selling prices and higher rd costs 

• ebu operating income increased primarily due to improved pricing in industrial and consumer markets cost reductions from an increasing mix of leading edge bits and higher bit shipments 

changes in operating income or loss for each business unit for 2020 as compared to 2019 were as follows 

• cnbu operating income decreased primarily due to declines in dram pricing and mtu underutilization costs in 2020 related to 3d xpoint 

• mbu operating income decreased primarily due to declines in lowpower dram and nand pricing partially offset by increases in sales of highvalue mcp products and manufacturing cost reductions 

• sbu operating margin improved primarily due to lower 3d xpoint underutilization costs manufacturing cost reductions increases in sales volumes and improved product mix partially offset by declines in selling prices 

• ebu operating income decreased as a result of declines in pricing partially offset by increases in sales volumes to the automotive and industrial markets 

operating expenses and other 

research and development  rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development and prequalification wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through internal reviews and tests for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 

rd expenses for 2021 increased 2 as compared to 2020 primarily due to increases in employee compensation and depreciation expense resulting from higher capital spending partially offset by lower volumes of development and prequalification wafers rd expenses for 2020 were 7 higher as compared to 2019 primarily due to increases in volumes of development and prequalification wafers a reduction of rd reimbursements from our partners increases in employee compensation and increases in subcontractor expense partially offset by lower depreciation expense from the revision of the estimated useful lives of equipment 

selling general and administrative  sga expenses for 2021 were relatively unchanged as compared to 2020 sga expenses for 2020 were 5 higher as compared to 2019 due to increases in employee compensation and legal costs partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees 

restructure and asset impairments  in 2021 we ceased development of 3d xpoint technology and classified our lehi facility assets as held for sale we recognized a restructure charge of 435 million to write down the assets held for sale to the expected consideration to be received under our agreement with ti for further discussion see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – lehi utah fab and 3d xpoint” 

other operating and nonoperating income expense  see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – other operating income expense net” and “ – other nonoperating income expense net” 

interest income expense  net interest expense for 2021 increased by 66 million as compared to 2020 primarily due a decrease of 77 million in interest income as a result of decreases in interest rates on our cash and investments net interest expense for 2020 was 80 million as compared to 77 million of net interest income for 2019 a change of 157 million primarily due to 1 a 91 million decrease in interest income as a result of decreases in interest rates partially offset by higher average levels of cash and investment balances and 2 a 66 million increase in interest expense primarily due to an increase in our average debt outstanding and a reduction in the amount of interest expense capitalized in 2020 

income taxes  our income tax provision benefit consisted of the following 

our effective tax rate decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily as a result of a 104 million tax benefit recorded for the discrete 435 million charge to write down the lehi assets held for sale to the estimated consideration to be realized from the sale of these assets less expected selling costs other changes to our effective tax rate in the periods presented were primarily due to the geographic mix of our earnings our income tax provision decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of reductions in our profit before tax 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the united states including singapore where we have tax incentive arrangements these incentives expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2034 and are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds the effect of tax incentive 

42  2021 10k 

arrangements reduced our tax provision by 758 million benefiting our diluted earnings per share by 066 for 2021 by 215 million 019 per diluted share for 2020 and by 756 million 066 per diluted share for 2019 

see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – income taxes” 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products which can vary significantly from period to period we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations we expect from time to time to engage in a variety of financing transactions for such purposes including the issuance of securities as of september 2 2021 250 billion was available to draw under our revolving credit facility we expect to receive 900 million of proceeds from the sale of our lehi facility to ti in the first quarter of 2022 

cash and marketable investments totaled 1040 billion as of september 2 2021 and 919 billion as of september 3 2020 our investments consist primarily of bank deposits money market funds and liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities which are diversified among industries and individual issuers to mitigate credit risk we invest through highcreditquality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor as of september 2 2021 369 billion of our cash and marketable investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries 

to develop new product and process technology support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and equipment and rd we estimate capital expenditures in 2022 for property plant and equipment net of partner contributions to be between 11 billion and 12 billion and we expect the timing of our capital expenditures to be weighted more toward the first half of 2022 capital expenditures for 2022 are driven by our continued 176layer nand transition pilot line enablement for next generation nand and dram and continued infrastructure and prepayments to support the introduction of euv lithography actual amounts for 2022 will vary depending on market conditions as of september 2 2021 we had purchase obligations of approximately 287 billion for the acquisition of property plant and equipment of which approximately 256 billion is expected to be paid within one year 

for a description of contractual obligations such as debt leases and purchase obligations see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – debt” “ – leases” and “ – commitments” 

our board of directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to 10 billion of our outstanding common stock through openmarket purchases block trades privatelynegotiated transactions derivative transactions andor pursuant to a rule 10b51 trading plan the repurchase authorization has no expiration date does not obligate us to acquire any common stock and is subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash through september 2 2021 we have repurchased an aggregate of 404 billion of the authorized amount see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – equity” 

on august 2 2021 we announced that our board of directors had declared a quarterly dividend of 010 per share payable in cash on october 18 2021 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on october 1 2021 the declaration and payment of any future cash dividends are at the discretion and subject to the approval of our board of directors our board of directors decisions regarding the amount and payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as our financial condition results of operations capital requirements business conditions debt service obligations contractual restrictions industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 

we expect that our cash and investments cash flows from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

cash flows  

operating activities  cash provided by operating activities reflects net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation expense amortization of intangible assets asset impairments and stockbased compensation and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities the increase in cash provided by operating activities for 2021 as compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher net income adjusted for noncash items compared with the prior period and the effect of lower inventories partially offset by an increase in receivables due to a higher level of sales the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily due to lower net income and changes in working capital 

investing activities  for 2021 net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of 1003 billion of expenditures for property plant and equipment partially offset by inflows of 502 million of partner contributions for capital expenditures and 106 billion of net outflows from purchases sales and maturities of availableforsale securities

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

contingencies  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss if any from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in accounting for the resolution of contingencies significant judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods 

goodwill  we test goodwill for impairment in our fourth quarter each year or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform the goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the reporting unit for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value goodwill is tested for impairment by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value we would record an impairment loss up to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value for 2021 our qualitative assessment indicated that the fair value for all of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value and that a quantitative assessment was unnecessary 

determining when to test for impairment the reporting units the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates forecasted manufacturing costs and other expenses and are developed as part of our longrange planning process the same estimates are used in business planning forecasting and capital budgeting as part of our longterm manufacturing capacity analysis we test the reasonableness of the output of our longrange planning process by calculating an implied value per share and comparing that to current stock prices analysts’ consensus pricing and management’s expectations these estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit which are discounted using a riskadjusted rate to estimate a fair value the discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

income taxes  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of the applicable year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income our income tax provision or benefit is dependent in part on our ability to forecast future taxable income in japan the united states and other jurisdictions such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve significant judgments including among others projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes manufacturing and overhead costs levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost being determined on a fifo basis effective as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2021 we changed our method of inventory 

costing from average cost to fifo cost includes depreciation labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining net realizable value of inventories involves significant judgments including projecting future average selling prices and future sales volumes to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information actual selling prices and volumes may vary significantly from projected prices and volumes due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory and storage markets when these analyses reflect estimated net realizable values below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when inventories are actually sold as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to costs of goods sold can vary significantly differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our inventory by approximately 301 million as of september 2 2021 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory and storage markets actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories we review the major characteristics of product type and markets in determining the unit of account for which we perform the lower of average cost or net realizable value analysis and categorize all inventories including dram nand and other memory as a single group 

property plant and equipment  we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment based on technology node transitions capital spending and equipment reuse rates we also review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimate of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require significant judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition significant judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

revenue recognition  revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods contracts with our customers are generally shortterm in duration at fixed negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery we estimate a liability for returns using the expected value method based on historical returns in addition we generally offer price protection to our distributors which is a form of variable consideration that decreases the transaction price we use the expected value method based on historical price adjustments and current pricing trends to estimate the amount of revenue recognized from sales to distributors differences between the estimated and actual amounts are recognized as adjustments to revenue

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio as of september 2 2021 and september 3 2020 we had fixedrate debt of 39 billion and 49 billion respectively and as a result the fair value of our debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates we estimate that as of september 2 2021 and september 3 2020 a decrease in market interest rates of 1 would increase the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 200 million and 300 million respectively as of september 2 2021 we had variablerate debt of 209 billion and therefore a 1 increase in the interest rates of our variablerate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 21 million as of september 3 2020 we had variablerate debt of 125 billion and therefore a 1 increase in the interest rates of our variablerate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 13 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in “part i – item 1a risk factors” changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the functional currency for all of our operations is the us dollar the substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the us dollar however significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases and certain assets and liabilities are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro malaysian ringgit new taiwan dollar singapore dollar and yen we have established currency risk management programs for our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs which reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 122 million as of september 2 2021 and 98 million as of september 3 2020 we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within three months the effectiveness of our hedges is dependent among other factors upon our ability to accurately measure exposures on a timely basis to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs we may utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within two years see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – derivative instruments”

perform certain manufacturing processes as we continue to increase our production of high value products and solutions manufacturing costs are increasingly affected by the costs of asic controllers advanced and complex packaging configurations and testing at progressively higher performance speeds and quality levels we continuously enhance our production processes increase bits per wafer transition to higher density products and utilize advanced testing and assembly processes 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highlycontrolled clean environment to minimize yield loss from contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may be scrapped due to equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and contamination from airborne particles success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and improving process margin to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we continue to heighten quality control as our product offerings expand into higherend segments that require increasing performance targets 

our products are manufactured and sold in both packaged form and as unpackaged bare die our packaged products include packaged die memory modules and systemlevel solutions such as ssds managed nand and mcps we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases outsource assembly services for certain packaged die memory modules ssds and mcps we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow and perform high temperature burnin on finished products in addition we use our proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor die capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing and supply chain operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our costs can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume products and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 

arrangements with intel 

since 2006 we and intel owned and operated imft a joint venture that manufactured semiconductor products exclusively for its members under longterm supply agreements at prices approximating cost through 2018 imft manufactured nand memory and subsequent to that time manufactured 3d xpoint memory in the first quarter of 2020 we acquired intel’s interest in imft see “part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – equity” “– debt” and “– research and development” 

supply chain materials and thirdparty service providers 

our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services we generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials and services that meet our standards and in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of materials or components such as chemicals silicon wafers gases photoresist controllers substrates lead frames printed circuit boards targets and reticle glass blanks shortages or increases in lead times may occur from time to time in the future our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with thirdparty manufacturers of controllers used in a number of our products and with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers contract manufacturers logistic carriers and other service providers we monitor and manage supplychain activities to mitigate risks associated with raw materials and service providers certain materials are primarily available in certain countries including rare earth elements minerals and metals available primarily from china trade disputes or other political conditions economic conditions or public health issues such as covid19 may limit our ability to obtain such materials although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers china is the 

predominant producer of certain of these materials in addition we andor our suppliers and service providers could be affected by tariffs embargoes or other trade restrictions as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change conflict minerals responsible sourcing practices public health crises or contagious disease outbreaks which can limit the supply of our materials andor increase the cost 

marketing and customers 

we continue to transform how we interact with our customers from transactional opportunistic sales of standardized memory components to collaborative relationships where we work with our customers to understand their unique opportunities and challenges many of our customers require thorough review or qualification of our products by engaging with our customers early in the product lifecycle to identify and design features and performance characteristics into our products we are able to manufacture products that anticipate and address our customers’ changing needs collaborating with our customers on their design needs in changing end markets allows us to differentiate our memory and storage solutions which provides greater value to our customers 

our semiconductor memory and storage products are offered under our micron and crucial brand names and through private labels we market our semiconductor memory and storage products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world we sell our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives distributors and retailers our independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and we then make shipments against these orders directly to customers or through our distributors our distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors’ products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products 

in each of the last three years approximately onehalf of our total net sales were to our top ten customers for other information regarding our concentrations and customers see “part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – certain concentrations” 

sales of our memory and storage products and the transfer of related technical information and knowhow including support are subject to laws and regulations governing international trade including but not limited to export control customs and sanctions regulations administered by us government agencies such as the bureau of industry and security “bis” of the us department of commerce and the office of foreign asset control of the us department of the treasury other jurisdictions such as the european union or china also maintain or may implement similar laws and regulations with which we must comply any such laws or regulations may require that we either obtain licenses or other authorizations to export certain of our products or sell them to certain countries companies or individuals or in the absence of such licenses or authorizations not export or sell the applicable products or transfer the related technical information and knowhow to the affected countries companies or individuals in addition increased tariffs imposed by the countries in which our products are sold can increase the cost of our product to our customers the laws and regulations that govern international trade change frequently sometimes without advance notice see “item 1a risk factors – trade regulations have restricted our ability to sell our products to several customers could restrict our ability to sell our products to other customers or in certain markets or could otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations” and “ – we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition” 

backlog 

because of volatile industry conditions our customers are generally reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our memory and storage products may fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the time of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period

• deterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets that could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures result in losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties and result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults 

the resumption of normal business operations after such interruptions may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of covid19 on our team members contractors suppliers thirdparty service providers customers or distributors 

these effects alone or taken together could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations legal exposure or financial condition a sustained prolonged or recurring outbreak could exacerbate the adverse impact of such measures 

volatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products may adversely affect our business 

we have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices including dramatic declines as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such volatility in the future in some prior periods average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 



beginning in 2020 revenue and units for mcps and ssds which contain both dram and nand are disaggregated based on the relative values of each component prior periods presented in the table above have been conformed to current period presentation 

we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins 

our gross margins are dependent in part upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs including but not limited to process linewidth additional 3d memory layers additional bits per cell ie cell levels architecture number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and yield in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins factors that may limit our ability to maintain or reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes difficulties in transitioning to smaller linewidth process technologies 3d memory layers nand cell levels transitioning to replacement gate technology for nand process 

15  2020 10k 

complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps manufacturing yield technological barriers changes in process technologies and new products that may require relatively larger die sizes 

many factors may result in a reduction of our output or a delay in ramping production which could lead to underutilization of our production assets these factors may include among others a weak demand environment industry oversupply inventory surpluses our ramp of emerging technologies declining selling prices and changes in supply agreements a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed and do not vary proportionally with changes in production output as a result lower utilization and increases in our per gigabit manufacturing costs may adversely affect our gross margins business results of operations or financial condition 

in addition per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by a broader product portfolio which may have smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles our business and the markets we serve are subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on enduser preferences as a result we may have work in process or finished goods inventories that could become obsolete or in amounts that are in excess of our customers’ demand as a result we may incur charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventories which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition due to the customized nature of certain of the products we manufacture we may be unable to sell certain finished goods inventories to alternative customers or manufacture inprocess inventory to different specifications which may result in excess and obsolescence charges in future periods our inability to maintain or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc kioxia holdings corporation formerly toshiba memory corporation and western digital corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments may provide or have provided and may continue to provide significant assistance financial or otherwise to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries andor competitors in particular we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the chinese government and various stateowned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance china’s stated national policy objectives in addition the chinese government may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies some of our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share or take business of our key customers 

our competitors generally seek to increase wafer capacity improve yields and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some of our competitors have plans to ramp or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand could lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have cost or performance advantages 

the competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold average selling prices and manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technology support 

future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rd and product and process technology 

we estimate capital expenditures in 2021 for property plant and equipment net of partner contributions will be approximately 9 billion focused on technology transitions and product enablement investments in capital expenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows delays in completion and ramping of new production facilities could significantly impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our debt levels expected debt amortization and general economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us we have experienced volatility in our cash flows and operating results and may continue to experience such volatility in the future which may negatively affect our credit rating our credit rating may also be affected by our liquidity financial results economic risk or other factors which may increase the cost of future borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us in addition if our credit rating declines below a certain level our credit facility will be required to become secured by certain of our assets which may limit the amount or increase the cost of future financings there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows access capital or credit markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business 

the health crisis caused by covid19 has adversely affected economic conditions and caused a downturn in the worldwide economy downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and the current downturn has adversely affected our business as a result demand for certain of our products used in smartphones consumer electronics and automotive has declined reduced demand for these or other products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales if these adverse conditions persist or worsen we could experience additional reduction in demand for our products andor devices that incorporate our products future downturns could also adversely affect our business in addition to the extent our customers or distributors have elevated inventory levels we may experience a decrease in shortterm andor longterm demand andor pricing for our products 

a deterioration of conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable due to credit defaults as a result downturns in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

increases in tariffs or other trade restrictions or taxes on our or our customers’ products or equipment and supplies could have an adverse impact on our operations 

in 2020 88 of our revenue was from products shipped to customer locations outside the united states we also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside the united states additionally a significant portion of our facilities are located outside the united states including in taiwan singapore japan and china 

the united states and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods general trade tensions between the united states and china have been escalating since 2018 with us tariffs on chinese goods and retaliatory chinese tariffs on us goods some of our products are included in these tariffs higher duties on existing tariffs and further rounds of tariffs have been announced or threatened by us and chinese leaders additionally the united states has threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from other countries which could also impact certain of our customers’ or our operations if the united states were to impose current or additional tariffs on components that we or our suppliers source our cost for such components would increase we may also incur increases in manufacturing costs and supply chain risks due to our efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and our operations additionally tariffs on our customers’ products could impact their sales of such end products resulting in lower demand for our products 

17  2020 10k 

we cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the united states and other countries what products may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation further changes in trade policy tariffs additional taxes restrictions on exports or other trade barriers or restrictions on supplies equipment and raw materials including rare earth minerals may limit our ability to produce products increase our selling andor manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

trade regulations have restricted our ability to sell our products to several customers could restrict our ability to sell our products to other customers or in certain markets or could otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations 

international trade disputes have led and may continue to lead to new and increasing trade barriers and other protectionist measures that can increase our manufacturing costs make our products less competitive reduce demand for our products limit our ability to sell to certain customers or markets limit our ability to procure components or raw materials impede or slow the movement of our goods across borders impede our ability to perform rd activities or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further changes in trade policy domestic sourcing initiatives or other formal and informal measures that could make it more difficult to sell our products in or restrict our access to some markets andor customers 

escalating trade tensions between the united states and china have led to increased trade restrictions and have affected customer ordering patterns for example over the last 18 months the bis has enacted increasingly broad trade restrictions with respect to huawei which represented approximately 10 of our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 12 in 2019 culminating with restrictions that took effect on september 15 2020 and that currently prevent us and many other companies from shipping products to huawei we cannot predict the duration these restrictions will remain in place whether the bis will grant us or others licenses to ship products to huawei or whether the bis or other us or foreign government entities will enact similar restrictions with respect to other customers markets or products we may not be able to replace the lost revenue opportunities associated with such restrictions 

the united states has also imposed other restrictions on the export of us regulated products and technology to certain chinese technology companies including certain of our customers these restrictions have reduced our sales and continuing or future restrictions could adversely affect our financial results result in reputational harm to us due to our relationship with such companies or lead such companies to develop or adopt technologies that compete with our products it is difficult to predict what further traderelated actions governments may take and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to such actions for example us legislation has expanded the power of the us department of commerce to restrict the export of “emerging and foundational technologies” yet to be identified which could impact our current or future products 

trade disputes and protectionist measures or continued uncertainty about such matters could result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession and could cause our customers to reduce cancel or alter the timing of their purchases with us sustained trade tensions could lead to longterm changes in global trade and technology supply chains which could adversely affect our business and growth prospects trade restrictions that may be imposed by the united states china or other countries may impact our business in ways we cannot reasonably quantify including that some of our customers’ products which incorporate our solutions may also be impacted restrictions on our ability to sell and ship our products to huawei have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition in addition further increases in trade restrictions or barriers may negatively impact our revenue with huawei or other customers and any licenses we have received or could receive in the future could be rendered ineffective any such changes may have a further adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

although we have policies controls and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors suppliers or agents will not violate such laws or our policies violations of trade laws restrictions or regulations can result in fines criminal sanctions against us or our officers directors or employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation the technology industry is subject to intense media political and regulatory scrutiny which can increase our exposure to government investigations legal actions and penalties 

our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory and storage technologies 

our key semiconductor memory and storage products and technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on stacking additional 3d memory layers increasing bits per cell ie cell levels meeting higher density requirements and improving power consumption and reliability we may face technological barriers to continue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate which has generally reduced perunit cost we have invested and expect to continue to invest in rd for new and existing products which involves significant risk and uncertainties we may be unable to recover our investment in rd or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die size or increasing memory and storage densities our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance andor cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies there can be no assurance of the following 

• that we will be successful in developing competitive new semiconductor memory and storage technologies 

• that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products 

• that we will be able to successfully market these technologies and 

• that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 

we develop and produce advanced memory technologies including 3d xpoint memory a new class of nonvolatile technology there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market new product technologies will be successful unsuccessful efforts to develop new memory and storage technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with a select number of customers 

in each of the last three years approximately onehalf of our total revenue was from our top ten customers a disruption in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our business we could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve in addition any consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products may be sold our inability to meet our customers’ requirements or to qualify our products with them could adversely impact our revenue meaningful change in the inventory strategy of our customers particularly those in china could impact our industry bit demand growth outlook the loss of or restrictions on our ability to sell to one or more of our major customers such as those relating to huawei described above or any significant reduction in orders from or a shift in product mix by customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

in 2020 52 of our revenue was from sales to customers who have headquarters located outside the united states we ship our products to the locations specified by our customers customers with global supply chains and operations may request we deliver products to countries where they own or operate production facilities or to countries where they utilize thirdparty subcontractors or warehouses as a result 88 of our revenue in 2020 was from products shipped to customer locations outside the united states 

a substantial portion of our operations are conducted in taiwan singapore japan and china and many of our customers suppliers and vendors also operate internationally our operations and the global supply chain of the technology industry are subject to a number of risks including the effects of actions and policies of various governments across our global operations and supply chain for example political economic or other actions from china could impact taiwan and its economy and may adversely affect our operations in taiwan our customers and the technology industry supply chain in addition the us government has in the past restricted american firms from selling products and software to certain of our customers and may in the future impose similar bans or other restrictions on sales to one or more of our significant customers these restrictions may not prohibit our competitors from selling similar products to our customers which may result in our loss of sales and market share even when such restrictions are lifted financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed with respect to our 

19  2020 10k 

customers could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations and we may not be able to recover any customers or market share we lose while complying with such restrictions 

our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

• export and import duties changes to import and export regulations customs regulations and processes and restrictions on the transfer of funds 

• imposition of bans on sales of goods or services to one or more of our significant foreign customers 

• public health issues for example an outbreak of a contagious disease such as covid19 severe acute respiratory syndrome “sarscov” avian and swine influenza measles or ebola 

• compliance with us and international laws involving international operations including the foreign corrupt practices act of 1977 as amended export and import laws and similar rules and regulations 

• theft of intellectual property 

• political and economic instability including the effects of disputes between china and taiwan 

• government actions or civil unrest preventing the flow of products including delays in shipping and obtaining products cancellation of orders or loss or damage of products 

• problems with the transportation or delivery of products 

• issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest 

• longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 

• compliance with trade technical standards and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions 

• contractual and regulatory limitations on the ability to maintain flexibility with staffing levels 

• disruptions to manufacturing or rd activities as a result of actions imposed by foreign governments 

• changes in economic policies of foreign governments and 

• difficulties in staffing and managing international operations 

if we or our customers suppliers or vendors are impacted by these risks it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have been served with complaints in chinese courts alleging patent infringement 

we have been served with complaints in chinese courts alleging that we infringe certain chinese patents by manufacturing and selling certain products in china the complaints seek orders requiring us to destroy inventory of the accused products and equipment for manufacturing the accused products in china to stop manufacturing using selling and offering for sale the accused products in china and to pay damages plus court fees 

we are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions of infringement made against us and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our operations in china products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see “part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – contingencies” 

we are subject to allegations of anticompetitive conduct 

on april 27 2018 a complaint was filed against micron and other dram suppliers in the us district court for the northern district of california subsequently two substantially identical cases were filed in the same court the lawsuits purported to be on behalf of a nationwide class of indirect purchasers of dram products on september 3 2019 the district court granted micron’s motion to dismiss and allowed plaintiffs the opportunity to file a consolidated amended complaint on october 28 2019 the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint that purports to be on behalf of a nationwide class of indirect purchasers of dram products the amended complaint asserts claims based on alleged pricefixing of dram products under federal and state law during the period from june 1 2016 to at least february 1 2018 and seeks treble monetary damages costs interest attorneys’ fees and other injunctive and equitable relief 

on june 26 2018 a complaint was filed against micron and other dram suppliers in the us district court for the northern district of california subsequently four substantially identical cases were filed in the same court on october 28 2019 the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint the consolidated complaint purports to be on behalf of a nationwide class of direct purchasers of dram products the consolidated complaint asserts claims 

based on alleged pricefixing of dram products under federal and state law during the period from june 1 2016 through at least february 1 2018 and seeks treble monetary damages costs interest attorneys’ fees and other injunctive and equitable relief 

additionally six cases have been filed in the following canadian courts superior court of quebec the federal court of canada the ontario superior court of justice and the supreme court of british columbia the substantive allegations in these cases are similar to those asserted in the cases filed in the united states 

on may 15 2018 the chinese state administration for market regulation “samr” notified micron that it was investigating potential collusion and other anticompetitive conduct by dram suppliers in china on may 31 2018 samr made unannounced visits to our sales offices in beijing shanghai and shenzhen to seek certain information as part of its investigation we are cooperating with samr in its investigation 

we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of these matters could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by the limited availability and quality of materials supplies and capital equipment or the dependency on thirdparty service providers 

our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services we generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials and services that meet our standards and in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of materials or components such as chemicals silicon wafers gases photoresist controllers substrates lead frames printed circuit boards targets and reticle glass blanks shortages or increases in lead times may occur from time to time in the future our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with thirdparty manufacturers of controllers used in a number of our products and with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers contract manufacturers logistic carriers and other service providers 

certain materials are primarily available in certain countries including rare earth elements minerals and metals available primarily from china trade disputes or other political conditions economic conditions or public health issues such as covid19 may limit our ability to obtain such materials although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers china is the predominant producer of certain of these materials if china were to restrict or stop exporting these materials our suppliers’ ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities or obtain supply in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost constrained supply of rare earth elements minerals and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from china 

we andor our suppliers and service providers could be affected by tariffs embargoes or other trade restrictions as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change conflict minerals responsible sourcing practices public health crises contagious disease outbreaks or other matters which could limit the supply of our materials andor increase the cost environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials lead times for the supply of materials have been extended in the past our ability to procure components to repair equipment essential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in supply chains among other items the disruption of our supply of materials components services or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers’ limited capacity our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at 

21  2020 10k 

new facilities and could increase our overall costs of a ramp our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

new product and market development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products including systemlevel memory and storage products and solutions which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technology and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product and systemlevel solution development over the next several years additionally we are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands of our customers which increases our reliance on our customers’ ability to accurately forecast the needs and preferences of their customers as a result our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers 

for certain of our markets it is important that we deliver products in a timely manner with increasingly advanced performance characteristics at the time our customers are designing and evaluating samples for their products if we do not meet their product design schedules our customers may exclude us from further consideration as a supplier for those products the process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance often well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers the effects of the public health crisis caused by the covid19 outbreak and the measures being taken to limit covid19’s spread could negatively impact our ability to meet anticipated timelines andor expected or required quality standards with respect to the development of certain of our products in addition some of our components have long leadtimes requiring us to place orders several months in advance of anticipated demand such long leadtimes increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand there can be no assurance that 

• our product development efforts will be successful 

• we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products 

• we will be able to successfully market these products 

• we will be able to establish or maintain key relationships with customers or that we will not be prohibited from working with certain customers for specific chip set or design requirements 

• we will be able to introduce new products into the market and qualify them with our customers on a timely basis or 

• margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 

our unsuccessful efforts to develop new products and solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

increases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop and qualify our system solutions 

our development of systemlevel memory and storage products is dependent in part upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers’ specifications for those products developing and manufacturing systemlevel products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner if we fail to identify or develop products on a timely basis or at all that comply with our customers’ specifications or achieve design wins with our customers we may experience a significant adverse impact on our revenue and margins even if our products meet customer specifications our sales of systemlevel solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices our competitors’ products may be less costly provide better performance or include additional features when compared to our products our longterm ability to sell systemlevel memory and storage products is reliant upon our customers’ ability to create market and sell their products containing our systemlevel solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner if we fail to successfully develop and market systemlevel products our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

even if we are successful in selling systemlevel solutions to our customers in sufficient volume we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our perunit manufacturing costs exceed our perunit selling prices manufacturing systemlevel solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle as compared to discrete products to design test and qualify which may increase our costs additionally some of our system solutions are 

increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications which increases our costs and time to market additionally we may need to update our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications andor industry standards which increases our costs system complexities and extended warranties for systemlevel products could also increase our warranty costs our failure to costeffectively manufacture systemlevel solutions andor firmware in a timely manner may result in reduced demand for our systemlevel products and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

products that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application our products and solutions may be deemed fully or partially responsible for functionality in our customers’ products and may result in sharing or shifting of product or financial liability from our customers to us for costs incurred by the end user as a result of our customers’ products failing to perform as specified in addition if our products and solutions perform critical functions in our customers’ products or are used in highrisk consumer end products such as autonomous driver assistance programs home and enterprise security smoke and noxious gas detectors medical monitoring equipment or wearables for child and elderly safety our potential liability may increase we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

• we may be required or agree to compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible products and to replace products 

• we could incur a decrease in revenue or adjustment to pricing commensurate with the reimbursement of such costs or alleged damages and 

• we may encounter adverse publicity which could cause a decrease in sales of our products or harm our reputation or relationships with existing or potential customers 

any of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property 

we maintain a system of controls over our intellectual property including us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets licensing arrangements confidentiality procedures nondisclosure agreements with employees consultants and vendors and a general system of internal controls despite our system of controls over our intellectual property it may be possible for our current or future competitors to obtain copy use or disclose illegally or otherwise our product and process technology or other proprietary information the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do us laws and our confidentiality nondisclosure and noncompete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce 

additionally our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract develop and retain highly skilled employees global competition for such skilled employees in our industry is intense due to the volatile nature of our industry and our operating results a decline in our operating results andor stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees whose compensation is dependent in part upon the market price of our common stock achieving certain performance metrics levels of company profitability or other financial or companywide performance if our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees they may directly benefit from the knowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment 

our inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

claims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon misappropriate misuse or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights we are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions made against us any of these types of claims regardless of the merits could subject us to significant costs to defend or resolve such claims and may consume a substantial portion of management’s time and attention as a result of these claims we may be required to 

• pay significant monetary damages fines royalties or penalties 

• enter into license or settlement agreements covering such intellectual property rights 

• make material changes to or redesign our products andor manufacturing processes andor 

• cease manufacturing having made selling offering for sale importing marketing or using products andor manufacturing processes in certain jurisdictions 

we may not be able to take any of the actions described above on commercially reasonable terms and any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see “part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – contingencies” 

we have a number of intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make onetime or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us the failure to obtain or renew licenses as necessary could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

legal proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

from time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business or otherwise both domestically and internationally see “item 3 legal proceedings” any claim with or without merit could result in significant legal fees that could negatively impact our financial results disrupt our operations and require significant attention from our management we could be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising from our relationships with vendors or customers supply agreements or contractual obligations with our subcontractors or business partners we may also be associated with and subject to litigation arising from the actions of our vendors subcontractors or business partners we may also be subject to litigation or claims as a result of our indemnification obligations including obligations to defend our customers against thirdparty claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights which may include patents trademarks copyrights or trade secrets we may also be subject to claims or litigation arising from the terms of our product warranties or from product liability claims as we continue to focus on developing system solutions with manufacturers of consumer products including autonomous driving augmented reality and others we may be exposed to greater potential for personal liability claims against us as a result of consumers’ use of those products we our officers or our directors could also be subject to claims of alleged violations of securities laws there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities and we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters exposures to various legal proceedings and claims could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend claims are required to pay damage awards or enter into settlement agreements any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our manufacturing process is disrupted by operational issues natural disasters or other events our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we and our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously 

implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the united states singapore taiwan japan malaysia and china 

from time to time there have been disruptions in the manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment disruptions in supply of raw materials or components or equipment failures we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations additionally other events including political or public health crises such as an outbreak of contagious diseases like covid19 sarscov avian and swine influenza measles or ebola may affect our production capabilities or that of our suppliers including as a result of quarantines closures of production facilities lack of supplies or delays caused by restrictions on travel or shipping for example in march 2020 the government of malaysia announced measures to restrict movement in that country in an effort to suppress the number of covid19 cases those restrictions temporarily limited our ability to fully operate our manufacturing facilities in that country the events noted above have occurred from time to time in the past and may occur in the future as a result in addition to disruptions to operations our insurance premiums may increase or we may not be able to fully recover any sustained losses through insurance 

if production is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers’ requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs loss of revenue or damage to customer relationships any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

breaches of our security systems or those of our customers suppliers or business partners could expose us to losses 

we maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities we also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations in addition we process store and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees including sensitive personal information unauthorized persons or employees may gain access to our facilities or network systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information compromise confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities breaches of our physical security and attacks on our network systems or breaches or attacks on our customers suppliers or business partners who have confidential or sensitive information regarding us and our customers and suppliers could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers suppliers or employees is compromised the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we face risks associated with our former imft joint venture with intel 

on october 31 2019 we purchased intel’s noncontrolling interest in the imft joint venture now known as mtu our acquisition involves risks including but not limited to continued underutilization of the mtu facility we also face risks from our arbitration proceeding with intel in which we and intel have made claims against each other for damages relating to the joint venture for information regarding the arbitration proceeding see “part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – contingencies” the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition 

we have incurred in the past and expect to incur in the future debt to finance our capital investments business acquisitions and restructure of our capital structure as of september 3 2020 we had debt with a carrying value of 664 billion as of september 3 2020 250 billion of our revolving credit facility was available to us as of september 3 2020 the conversion value in excess of principal of our convertible notes was 486 million based on the trading price of our common stock of 4633 per share on such date 

25  2020 10k 

our debt obligations could adversely impact us for example these obligations could 

• require us to use a large portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on debt which will reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions rd expenditures and other business activities 

• require us to use cash andor issue shares of our common stock to settle any conversion obligations of our convertible notes 

• result in certain of our debt instruments being accelerated to be immediately due and payable or being deemed to be in default if certain terms of default are triggered such as applicable cross payment default andor crossacceleration provisions 

• adversely impact our credit rating which could increase future borrowing costs 

• limit our future ability to raise funds for capital expenditures strategic acquisitions or business opportunities rd and other general corporate requirements 

• restrict our ability to incur specified indebtedness create or incur certain liens and enter into saleleaseback financing transactions 

• increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and semiconductor memory and storage industry conditions 

• increase our exposure to interest rate risk from variable rate indebtedness 

• continue to dilute our earnings per share as a result of the conversion provisions in our convertible notes and 

• require us to continue to pay cash amounts substantially in excess of the principal amounts upon settlement of our convertible notes to minimize dilution of our earnings per share 

our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows or obtain external financing in the future this to some extent is subject to market economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs additionally events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable drawdown conditions and utilize our revolving credit facility in 2019 we suspended the security interest in the collateral under our credit facility upon achieving a specified credit rating and prepaying our senior secured term loan b due in 2022 however if our corporate credit rating were to decline below a certain level the security interest would be automatically reinstated which may limit the amount or increase the cost of future financings if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we must attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees 

to remain competitive we must attract retain and motivate executives and other highly skilled employees as well as effectively manage or plan for succession for key employees competition for experienced employees in our industry can be intense hiring and retaining qualified executives engineers technical staff and sales representatives is critical to our business our inability to attract retain or effectively manage or plan for succession of key employees may inhibit our ability to maintain or expand our business operations additionally changes to immigration policies in the numerous countries in which we operate including the united states as well as restrictions on global travel as a result of local or global public health crises requiring quarantines or other precautions to limit exposure to infectious diseases may limit our ability to hire andor retain talent in or transfer talent to specific locations if our total compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda 

in january 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimonda’s insolvency proceedings filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor bv “micron bv” in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void a share purchase agreement between micron bv and qimonda signed in 2008 pursuant to which micron bv purchased substantially all of qimonda’s shares of inotera representing approximately 18 of inotera’s outstanding shares at that time and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate 

the complaint also seeks among other things to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate a patent crosslicense between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement see “part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – contingencies” for further information regarding the matter 

we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron bv from the ownership of the inotera shares andor the termination of the patent crosslicense which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

we operate in a number of locations outside the united states including singapore where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the geographic mix of our earnings among these jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements expanding our operations in various countries and changes in tax laws and regulations additionally we file income tax returns with the us federal government various us states and various other jurisdictions throughout the world and certain tax returns may remain open to examination for several years the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a change in tax laws in key jurisdictions could materially increase our tax expense 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and many foreign jurisdictions changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flows from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition for example our effective tax rate increased from 12 for 2018 to 98 for 2019 primarily as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act enacted in december 2017 by the united states additionally various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative actions to increase tax revenue further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organisation for economic cooperation and development which represents a coalition of member countries and recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles if implemented by taxing authorities such changes as well as changes in us federal and state tax laws or in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our incentives from various governments are conditional upon achieving or maintaining certain performance obligations and are subject to reduction termination or clawback 

we have received and may in the future continue to receive benefits and incentives from national state and local governments in various regions of the world designed to encourage us to establish maintain or increase investment workforce or production in those regions these incentives may take various forms including grants loan subsidies and tax arrangements and typically require us to perform or maintain certain levels of investment capital spending employment technology deployment or research and development activities to qualify for such incentives we cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve performance obligations required to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide such funding these incentive arrangements typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our performance with their terms and obligations such audits could result in modifications to or termination of the applicable incentive program the incentives we receive could be subject to reduction termination or clawback and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 

• integrating the operations technologies and products of acquired or newly formed entities into our operations 

• increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities 

• increased debt levels 

• the assumption of unknown or underestimated liabilities 

• the use of cash to finance a transaction which may reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital capital expenditures rd expenditures and other business activities 

• diverting management’s attention from daily operations 

• managing larger or more complex operations and facilities and employees in separate and diverse geographic areas 

• hiring and retaining key employees

the global memory and storage industry has experienced consolidation and may continue to consolidate we engage from time to time in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

across our global operations significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the euro singapore dollar new taiwan dollar and yen in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies exchange rates for some of these currencies against the us dollar have been volatile and may be volatile in future periods if these currencies strengthen against the us dollar our manufacturing costs could significantly increase exchange rates for the us dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur restructuring charges in future periods 

from time to time we have and may in the future enter into restructure initiatives in order to among other items streamline our operations respond to changes in business conditions our markets or product offerings or to centralize certain key functions we may not realize expected savings or other benefits from our restructure activities and may incur additional restructure charges or other losses in future periods associated with other initiatives in connection with any restructure initiatives we could incur restructure charges loss of production output loss of key personnel disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

compliance with customer and responsible sourcing requirements and related regulations could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain materials supplies and services used in manufacturing our products 

many of our customers have adopted responsible sourcing programs that require us to periodically report on our supply chain and responsible sourcing efforts to ensure we source the materials supplies and services we use and incorporate into the products we sell in a manner that is consistent with their programs some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products meet the specifications of their responsible sourcing programs meeting customer requirements may limit the sourcing and availability of some of the materials supplies and services we use particularly when the availability of such materials supplies and services is concentrated to a limited number of suppliers this in turn may affect our ability andor the cost to obtain in sufficient quantities materials supplies and services necessary for the manufacture of our products 

this increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 and its implementing sec regulations the act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo and finance or benefit local armed groups these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors

the amount and frequency of our share repurchases may fluctuate and we cannot guarantee that we will fully consummate our share repurchase authorization or that it will enhance longterm shareholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves 

the amount timing and execution of our share repurchases pursuant to our share repurchase authorization may fluctuate based on our operating results cash flows and priorities for the use of cash for other purposes these purposes include but are not limited to operational spending capital spending acquisitions and repayment of debt other factors including changes in tax laws could also impact our share repurchases although our board of directors has authorized share repurchases of up to 10 billion of our outstanding common stock the authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any common stock

 item 3 legal proceedings 

reorganization proceedings of the mmj companies 

in 2013 we completed the acquisition of elpida memory inc now known as mmj pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement on support for reorganization companies the “sponsor agreement” that we entered into in 2012 with the trustees of the mmj companies’ pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan under the sponsor agreement we agreed to provide certain support for the reorganization of the mmj companies and the trustees agreed to seek approval for such support from the tokyo district court and the mmj companies’ reorganization creditors 

31  2020 10k 

the reorganization provided for payments by the mmj companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen less certain expenses the plan of reorganization also provided for our cash payment at closing of 60 billion yen into mmj to fund the initial installment payment to the creditors of 60 billion yen in exchange for 100 ownership of mmj’s equity 

under mmj’s plan of reorganization secured creditors recovered 100 of the amount of their fixed claims on or before the sixth annual installment payment and unsecured creditors recovered at least 174 of the amount of their fixed claims in seven annual installments in connection with our sale of mai in 2017 the remaining mai creditor obligation was paid in full and mai’s reorganization proceedings were closed at that time 

because mmj’s plan of reorganization provided for ongoing payments to creditors the reorganization proceedings continued following the closing of the mmj acquisition and mmj remained subject to the oversight of the tokyo district court and two trustees the final creditor payment under mmj’s plan of reorganization occurred in december 2019 and on july 22 2020 the tokyo district court issued a termination order formally closing the reorganization proceedings and ending the oversight of mmj’s operations by the tokyo district court and trustees

impact of covid19 on our business 

events surrounding the ongoing covid19 outbreak have resulted in a reduction in economic activity across the globe which has affected demand for certain of our products while we have observed demand increases in some areas of our business that support a stayathome economy such as products used in data center infrastructure notebook computers and similar applications we have also observed demand decreases in other categories such as smartphones consumer electronics automotive desktop pcs and enterprise markets the ultimate extent to which covid19 will impact demand for our products depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and very difficult to predict including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and actions to contain and treat its impacts 

while all our global sites are currently operating with close to full staff and at normal capacity levels our facilities could be required to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates we may be required to or deem it to be in the best interest of our employees customers partners suppliers and stakeholders to alter our business operations in order to maintain a healthy and safe environment it is not clear what potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business including effects on our customers employees and prospects or on our financial results we are following government policies and recommendations designed to slow the spread of covid19 and remain committed to the health and safety of our team members contractors suppliers customers distributors and communities 

our efforts to respond to the covid19 outbreak include the following 

• we have put health screenings in place required physical distancing established team separation protocols and made equipment upgrades at our facilities we are also prohibiting visitors have significantly decreased business travel and are generally requiring team members to work from home where possible where work from home is not possible all onsite team members must pass thermal scanning equipment to ensure they do not have an elevated body temperature and must wear a mask at all times 

• to respond to changing market conditions we have shifted some supply from markets which have experienced declines in demand such as smartphones consumer electronics desktop pcs automotive and enterprise to markets that have experienced demand increases such as data center cloud server notebooks and gaming 

• we have evaluated our supply chain and communicated with our suppliers to identify supply gaps and taken steps to ensure continuity in some cases we have added alternative suppliers and increased our onhand inventory of raw materials needed in our operations 

• we have added assembly and test capacity to provide redundant manufacturing capability through our network of captive operations and external partners 

• we are evaluating all our construction projects across our global manufacturing operations and enacting protocols to enhance the safety of our team members suppliers and contractors 

• we have developed strategies and are implementing measures to respond to a variety of potential economic scenarios such as limitations on new hiring and business travel and reductions of discretionary spending 

• we are working with government authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate and continuing to monitor our operations in an effort to ensure we follow government requirements relevant regulations industry standards and best practices to help safeguard our team members while safely continuing operations at our sites across the globe 

we believe these actions are appropriate and prudent to safeguard our team members contractors suppliers customers and communities while allowing us to safely continue operations but we cannot predict how the steps we our team members government entities suppliers or customers take in response to the covid19 outbreak will ultimately impact our business outlook or results of operations

results of operations 

consolidated results 



total revenue  total revenue for 2020 decreased 8 as compared to 2019 primarily due to a decline in dram sales partially offset by an increase in nand sales sales of dram products for 2020 decreased 14 as compared to 2019 as average selling prices declined in the mid30 range due to challenging market conditions partially offset by growth in bit shipments in the low30 range driven by cloud server enterprise server and mobile markets sales of nand products for 2020 increased 14 as compared to 2019 primarily due to increases in bit shipments in the mid20 range driven by sales of ssds to data center customers and sales of managed nand products partially offset by a highsingle digit percent decline in average selling prices 

the us bureau of industry and security “bis” enacted broad trade restrictions with respect to huawei which represented approximately 10 of our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 12 in 2019 that took effect on september 15 2020 and currently prevent us from shipping products to huawei we cannot predict the duration these restrictions will remain in place and whether the bis will grant us licenses to ship products to huawei we may not be able to replace the lost revenue opportunities associated with such restrictions 

total revenue for 2019 decreased 23 as compared to 2018 primarily due to pricing declines resulting from the challenging memory market environment in 2019 sales of dram products for 2019 decreased 28 as compared to 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices of approximately 30 resulting from supply and demand imbalances customer inventory corrections and cpu shortages sales of nand products for 2019 decreased 12 as compared to 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices in the mid40 range resulting from supply and demand imbalances which were partially offset by significant increases in sales volumes in addition demand for our nand products was adversely affected by the transition from sata ssds to nvme ssds the higher nand sales volumes in 2019 were driven by increases in sales of highvalue mobile managed nand products as well as discrete nand products enabled by our execution in ramping 64 and 96layer tlc 3d nand 

overall gross margin  our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 31 for 2020 from 46 for 2019 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by the effect of decreases in noncash depreciation expense from the revision in estimated useful lives of equipment in our nand wafer fabrication facilities described below cost reductions resulting from strong execution in delivering products featuring advanced technologies and continuous improvement initiatives to reduce production costs our gross margins included the impact of underutilization costs at mtu of 557 million for 2020 384 million for 2019 and 262 million for 2018 we expect underutilization costs at mtu to gradually decline through 2021 as we redeploy equipment and continue to rightsize our capacity 

our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 46 for 2019 from 59 for 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by cost reductions resulting from strong execution in delivering products featuring advanced technologies and from continuous improvement initiatives to reduce production costs 

we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment based on our assessment of planned technology node transitions capital spending and reuse rates we revised the estimated useful lives of the existing equipment in our nand wafer fabrication facilities and our research and development facilities from five years to seven years as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2020 the revision in estimated useful lives reduced nand manufacturing depreciation expense by approximately 565 million in 2020 of which approximately 165 million remained capitalized in inventory as of the end of 2020 adjusting for the effect of the reduced amount of depreciation expense remaining in inventory the revision in estimated useful lives benefited cost of goods sold by approximately 400 million for 2020 

revenue by business unit 



percentages of total revenue may not total 100 due to rounding 

changes in revenue for each business unit for 2020 as compared to 2019 were as follows 

• cnbu revenue decreased 8 primarily due to dram price declines driven by imbalances in supply and demand partially offset by bit sales growth across key markets particularly in cloud server and graphics markets in addition in the second quarter of 2020 we determined that the 3d xpoint technology and product roadmap are more closely aligned with our cnbu strategy than our sbu strategy and 3d xpoint became an integral part of cnbu accordingly we began to report all 3d xpoint activities within cnbu from that date 

• mbu revenue decreased 11 primarily due to price declines partially offset by bit sales growth for highvalue mobile mcp products 

• sbu revenue decreased 2 primarily due to the decline in 3d xpoint revenue in sbu after the first quarter of 2020 as noted above and nand selling price declines partially offset by bit sales growth for ssds sbu revenue included products manufactured and sold to intel under a longterm supply agreement at prices approximating cost which included 3d xpoint memory and nand aggregating 124 million 682 million and 541 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

• ebu revenue decreased 12 primarily due to price declines resulting from the impact of the global covid19 pandemic on automotive industrial and consumer segments partially offset by bit sales growth from transitions to an increasing mix of highdensity dram and nand products 

changes in revenue for each business unit for 2019 as compared to 2018 were as follows 

• cnbu revenue decreased 35 due to challenging market conditions in 2019 which led to price declines 

• mbu revenue decreased 3 primarily due to price declines offset by strong execution in developing and qualifying mobile managed nand products and continued content growth in smartphones which combined to drive a significant increase in shipment volumes 

• sbu revenue decreased 24 primarily due to price declines partially offset by significant growth in shipment volumes as a result of strong execution in ramping 64layer and 96layer tlc nand products 

• ebu revenue decreased 10 primarily due to lower sales to consumer markets as a result of weak demand and pricing partially offset by increases in sales to automotive and industrial markets

operating income loss by business unit 



percentages reflect operating income loss as a percentage of revenue for each business unit 

changes in operating income or loss for each business unit for 2020 as compared to 2019 were as follows 

• cnbu operating income decreased primarily due to declines in dram pricing and mtu underutilization costs in 2020 related to 3d xpoint 

• mbu operating income decreased primarily due to declines in lowpower dram and nand pricing partially offset by increases in sales of highvalue mcp products and manufacturing cost reductions 

• sbu operating margin improved primarily due to lower 3d xpoint underutilization costs manufacturing cost reductions increases in sales volumes and improved product mix partially offset by declines in selling prices 

• ebu operating income decreased as a result of declines in pricing partially offset by increases in sales volumes to the automotive and industrial markets 

changes in operating income or loss for each business unit for 2019 as compared to 2018 were as follows 

• cnbu operating income decreased primarily due to declines in pricing and higher rd costs partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions 

• mbu operating income decreased primarily due to declines in pricing partially offset by increases in sales of highvalue managed nand products and manufacturing cost reductions 

• sbu operating margin declined primarily due to declines in pricing which were partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions and increases in sales volumes sbu operating results for 2019 and 2018 were adversely impacted by the underutilization costs at imft 

• ebu operating income decreased as a result of declines in pricing and higher rd costs partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions and increases in sales volumes 

operating expenses and other 

research and development  rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development and prequalification wafers processed amounts reimbursed under rd costsharing agreements the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 

rd expenses for 2020 were 7 higher as compared to 2019 primarily due to increases in volumes of development and prequalification wafers a reduction of rd reimbursements from our partners increases in employee compensation and increases in subcontractor expense partially offset by lower depreciation expense from the revision of the estimated useful lives of equipment rd expenses were reduced by 110 million in 2020 due to the revision of the estimated useful lives of equipment rd expenses for 2019 were 14 higher as compared to 2018 primarily due to decreases in reimbursements from our rd costsharing arrangements increases in depreciation expense as a result of increases in capital spending and increases in employee compensation 

we shared the cost of certain product and process development activities with development partners including agreements to jointly develop nand and 3d xpoint technologies with intel we substantially completed our costsharing agreements with intel to develop 3d nand and 3d xpoint technology in 2019 and 2020 respectively our rd expenses were reduced by 60 million for 2019 and 201 million for 2018 from reimbursements under these arrangements reimbursements were not significant in 2020 

selling general and administrative  sga expenses for 2020 were 5 higher as compared to 2019 due to increases in employee compensation and legal costs partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees sga expenses for 2019 were 3 higher as compared to 2018 primarily due to increases in legal costs and consulting fees partially offset by a reduction in employee compensation and sales commissions 

income taxes  our income tax provision benefit consisted of the following 



our income tax provision decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily as a result of reductions in our profit before tax our effective tax rate increased in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily as a result of the foreign minimum tax in december 2017 the united states enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which imposed a onetime transition tax in 2018 the “repatriation tax” and beginning in 2019 created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings the “foreign minimum tax” we recognize the foreign minimum tax in the period the tax is incurred 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the united states including singapore where we have tax incentive arrangements these incentives expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2034 and are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds the effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by 215 million benefiting our diluted earnings per share by 019 for 2020 by 756 million 066 per diluted share for 2019 and by 196 billion 159 per diluted share for 2018 

see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – income taxes” 

other  interest expense for 2020 increased 52 as compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in the average level of outstanding debt obligations in 2020 as compared to 2019 and to a reduction in the amount of interest expense capitalized in 2020 as compared to 2019 resulting from lower levels of capital projects in process interest income for 2020 decreased 44 as compared to 2019 as a result of decreases in interest rates partially offset by higher average levels of cash and investment balances 

interest expense for 2019 decreased 63 as compared to 2018 primarily due to prepayments repurchases and conversions of debt and to an increase in the amount of interest expense capitalized from higher levels of capital spending partially offset by increases in debt obligations interest income for 2019 increased 71 as compared to 2018 primarily due to increases in interest rates

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products which can vary significantly from period to period we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations we expect from time to time to engage in a variety of financing transactions for such purposes including the issuance of securities as of september 3 2020 250 billion was available to draw under our revolving credit facility we expect that our cash and investments cash flows from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months 

to develop new product and process technology support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and equipment and rd we estimate capital expenditures in 2021 for property plant and equipment net of partner contributions to be approximately 9 billion focused on technology transitions and product enablement and expect the timing of our capital expenditures to be more heavily weighted toward the first half of 2021 actual amounts for 2021 will vary depending on market conditions as of september 3 2020 we had purchase obligations of approximately 295 billion for the acquisition of property plant and equipment of which approximately 276 billion is expected to be paid within one year 

our board of directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to 10 billion of our outstanding common stock through openmarket purchases block trades privatelynegotiated transactions derivative transactions andor pursuant to a rule 10b51 trading plan the repurchase authorization has no expiration date does not obligate us to acquire any common stock and is subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash through september 3 2020 we had repurchased an aggregate of 284 billion of the authorized amount see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – equity” 

cash and marketable investments totaled 919 billion as of september 3 2020 and 912 billion as of august 29 2019 our investments consist primarily of bank deposits money market funds and liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities which are diversified among industries and individual issuers to mitigate credit risk we invest through highcreditquality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor as of september 3 2020 330 billion of our cash and marketable investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries 

cash flows  



operating activities  cash provided by operating activities reflects net income adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation expense amortization of intangible assets and stockbased compensation and the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities the decrease in cash provided by operating activities for 2020 and 2019 was primarily due to lower net income compared with the prior period and changes in working capital 

investing activities  for 2020 net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of 791 billion of expenditures for property plant and equipment net of partner contributions partially offset by 415 million of net inflows from sales maturities and purchases of availableforsale securities 

for 2019 net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of 903 billion of expenditures for property plant and equipment net of partner contributions and 117 billion of net outflows from sales maturities and purchases of availableforsale securities 

for 2018 net cash used for investing activities consisted primarily of 799 billion of expenditures for property plant and equipment net of partner contributions partially offset by 164 million of net inflows from sales maturities and purchases of availableforsale securities 

financing activities  for 2020 net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of 437 billion of cash payments to reduce our debt including 250 billion to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility 621 million for imft member debt repayments 534 million to prepay our 2025 notes 266 million to settle conversions of notes and 248 million for scheduled repayment of finance leases 744 million for the acquisition of intel’s noncontrolling interest in imft and 176 million for the acquisition of 36 million shares of our common stock under our 10 billion share repurchase authorization cash used for financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of 250 billion from our revolving credit facility 125 billion from the 2023 notes and 125 billion from the 2024 term loan a 

for 2019 net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of 266 billion for the acquisition of 67 million shares of treasury stock under our 10 billion share repurchase authorization and cash payments to reduce our debt including 165 billion to settle conversions of notes 728 million to prepay the 2022 term loan b 316 million for imft member debt repayments and 643 million for scheduled repayment of other notes and capital leases cash used for financing activities was partially offset by net proceeds of 353 billion from the aggregate issuance of the 2024 notes 2026 notes 2027 notes 2029 notes and 2030 notes 

for 2018 net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of cash payments to reduce our debt including 942 billion to prepay or repurchase debt and settle conversions of notes and 774 million for scheduled repayment of other notes and capital leases cash used for financing activities was partially offset by net proceeds of 136 billion from the issuance of 34 million shares of our common stock for 4100 per share in a public offering and 101 billion of proceeds from imft member debt

contractual obligations  



1 amounts include principal and interest 

2 amounts include contractually obligated minimum lease payments for operating leases having an initial noncancelable term in excess of one year 

3 purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria 1 they are noncancelable 2 we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled or 3 we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable the entire value of the contract was included in the above table if the obligation is cancelable but we would incur a penalty if canceled only the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation contracted minimum amounts specified in any takeorpay contracts were included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment purchase obligations also included 838 million for leases that have been executed but have not yet commenced such amounts will be reclassified as lease obligations in the table above at the time such assets become available for our use 

4 amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other longterm liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet including 168 million for the current portion of these longterm liabilities we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future certain payments related to uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities therefore the amount has been excluded from the preceding table however other noncurrent liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet included these uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

business acquisitions  accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized in subsequent periods accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred we typically obtain independent thirdparty valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows discount rates and comparable market values items involving significant assumptions estimates and judgments include the following 

• debt including discount rate and timing of payments 

• deferred tax assets including projections of future taxable income and tax rates 

• fair value of consideration paid or transferred 

• intangible assets including valuation methodology estimations of future revenue and costs profit allocation rates attributable to the acquired technology and discount rates 

• inventory including estimated future selling prices timing of product sales and completion costs for work in process and 

• property plant and equipment including determination of values in a continueduse model 

consolidation  we have interests in entities that are variable interest entities “vies” determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing whether an entity is a vie and if we are the entity’s primary beneficiary if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we are required to consolidate it to determine if we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies require significant assumptions and judgments 

contingencies  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss if any from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated in accounting for the resolution of contingencies significant judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods 

goodwill and intangible assets  we test goodwill for impairment in our fourth quarter each year or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform the goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the reporting unit for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value goodwill is tested for impairment by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value we would record an impairment loss up to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value 

determining when to test for impairment the reporting units the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates forecasted manufacturing costs and other expenses and are developed as part of our longrange planning process the same estimates are used in business planning forecasting and capital budgeting as part of our longterm manufacturing capacity analysis we test the reasonableness of the output of our longrange planning process by calculating an implied value per share and comparing that to current stock prices analysts’ consensus pricing and management’s expectations these estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit which are discounted using a riskadjusted rate to estimate a fair value the discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

we test other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows estimating fair values involves significant assumptions including future sales prices sales volumes costs and discount rates 

income taxes  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of the applicable year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which 

43  2020 10k 

requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in recent periods our results of operations have benefited from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and the united states our income tax provision or benefit is dependent in part on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve significant judgments including among others projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes manufacturing and overhead costs levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value cost includes depreciation labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining net realizable value of inventories involves significant judgments including projecting future average selling prices and future sales volumes to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated net realizable values below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when inventories are actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our inventory by approximately 525 million as of september 3 2020 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory and storage markets actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories we review the major characteristics of product type and markets in determining the unit of account for which we perform the lower of average cost or net realizable value analysis and categorize all inventories including dram nand and other memory as a single group 

property plant and equipment  we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment based on technology node transitions capital spending and equipment reuse rates based on our assessment of planned technology node transitions capital spending and reuse rates we revised the estimated useful lives of the existing equipment in our nand wafer fabrication facilities and our research and development “rd” facilities from five years to seven years as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2020 see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – property plant and equipment” 

we also review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimate of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require significant judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition significant judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

research and development  costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires significant judgment we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are included in cost of goods sold 

revenue recognition  revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods contracts with our customers are generally shortterm in duration at fixed negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery we estimate a liability for returns using the expected value method 

based on historical rates of return in addition we generally offer price protection to our distributors which is a form of variable consideration that decreases the transaction price we use the expected value method based on historical price adjustments and current pricing trends to estimate the amount of revenue recognized from sales to distributors differences between the estimated and actual amounts are recognized as adjustments to revenue 

stockbased compensation  stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on our assessment of the likelihood of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires significant judgment 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires significant judgment including estimating stock price volatility and expected option life we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock options and awards granted under our employee stock purchase plan we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio as of september 3 2020 and august 29 2019 we had fixedrate debt of 49 billion and 53 billion respectively and as a result the fair value of our debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates we estimate that as of september 3 2020 and august 29 2019 a decrease in market interest rates of 1 would increase the fair value of our fixedrate debt by nearly 300 million as of september 3 2020 we had variablerate debt of 125 billion and therefore a 1 increase in the interest rates of our variablerate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 13 million as of august 29 2019 we had no variable rate debt 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in “part i – item 1a risk factors” changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the functional currency for all of our operations is the us dollar the substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the us dollar however significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases and certain assets and liabilities are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro new taiwan dollar singapore dollar and yen we have established currency risk management programs for our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these 

45  2020 10k 

hedging programs which reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 98 million as of september 3 2020 and 149 million as of august 29 2019 we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within three months the effectiveness of our hedges is dependent among other factors upon our ability to accurately measure exposures on a timely basis to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures and manufacturing costs we may utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within two years see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – derivative instruments”

 item 9a controls and procedures 

an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act are recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure 

during the fourth quarter of 2020 there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control – integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of september 3 2020 the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of september 3 2020 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

manufacturing 

in recent years we have centralized certain key functions of our operations these centers of excellence enable us to maximize yield and reduce cycle times by combining front and backend manufacturing product engineering and specific technology development to most effectively transfer and ramp technology while driving efficient manufacturing in 2019 we completed construction and began operating our new singapore leadingedge 3d nand clean room expansion our singapore center of excellence enables us to transition to leadingedge technology nodes which require substantially more clean room space than prior nodes and maintain existing wafer capacity to meet market demand in our expanding storage business in 2019 we also completed construction and opened our new taiwan backend assembly and test facility which together with our existing taiwan facilities constitute our taiwan dram center of excellence the new facility enables us to integrate backend processes into our manufacturing environment while benefitting from economies of scale 

we manufacture our products at our whollyowned and joint venture facilities located in taiwan singapore japan the united states china and malaysia and also utilize subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes nearly all our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day seven days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment our dram nand 3d xpoint memory and nor products share a number of common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage much of our product and process technology and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines 

our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex and involves a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effectively deploying those techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth 3d nonvolatile layers nand cell levels process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps and manufacturing yield other factors include the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type cleanliness of our manufacturing environment and utilization of subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes we continuously enhance our production processes increasing bits per wafer and transitioning to higher density products as semiconductor memory technology has matured the rate of increases in bits per wafer and product density has slowed in 2019 we achieved bit shipment crossover to the 1xnm process node for dram significantly increased our production of the 1ynm process node and commenced volume production of 16gb ddr4 products with 1znm technology in 2019 we also continued to ramp our 96layer 3d nand technology and make progress on our 128layer 3d nand which uses replacement gate technology that we expect to ramp in 2020 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highlycontrolled clean environment to minimize yieldlimiting and quality contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may be scrapped due to equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and airborne particle defects success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

our products are manufactured and sold in both packaged and unpackaged bare die forms our packaged products include memory modules ssds and managed nand including mcps and emmcs we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases outsource assembly services for certain memory modules ssds and mcps we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow and perform high temperature burnin on finished products in addition we use our proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing and supply chain operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our costs can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume products and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 

arrangements with intel 

imft 

since 2006 we have owned 51  of imft a joint venture between us and intel imft is governed by a board of managers for which the number of managers appointed by each member varies based on the members respective ownership interests imft manufactures semiconductor products exclusively for its members under a longterm supply agreement at prices approximating cost in 2018 imft discontinued production of nand and subsequent to that time manufactured 3d xpoint memory members pay their proportionate share of fixed costs associated with imfts capacity 

in january 2019 we exercised our option to acquire intels interest in imft intel has set the closing date to occur on october 31 2019 in connection with our acquisition in the first quarter of 2020 we expect to pay intel approximately 14 billion  for intels interest in imft as well as imft member debt owed to intel 

until we complete our acquisition of intels noncontrolling interest in imft the members have rights and obligations to the capacity of imft in proportion to their investment including member debt financing any capital contribution or member debt financing results in a proportionate adjustment to the sharing of output on an eight month lag intel provided member debt financing of 101 billion  to imft in 2018 and imft repaid 316 million  to intel in 2019 as a result as of august 29 2019  current debt included 693 million  of imft member debt 

rd arrangements 

we have had agreements to jointly develop nand and 3d xpoint technologies with intel in 2018 we and intel agreed to independently develop subsequent generations of 3d nand we substantially completed our nand development costsharing arrangement with intel in the third quarter of 2019 in 2018 we also announced that we and intel would no longer jointly develop 3d xpoint technology beyond the second generation we substantially completed this costsharing arrangement in the first quarter of 2020 

supply chain materials and use of thirdparty service providers 

our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and also on the use of third parties to provide us with components and services we generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials and services that meet our standards in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of materials or components such as chemicals silicon wafers gases photoresist controllers substrates lead frames printed circuit boards targets and reticle glass blanks shortages or increases in lead times may occur from time to time in the future our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with thirdparty manufacturers of controllers used in a number of our products and with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers contract manufacturers logistic carriers and other service providers we monitor and manage supplychain activities to mitigate risks associated with raw materials and service providers certain materials are primarily available in certain countries including rare earth elements minerals and metals available primarily from china trade disputes or other political or economic conditions may limit our availability to obtain such materials although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers china is the predominant producer of certain of these materials in addition we andor our suppliers and service providers are and may continue to be affected by tariffs embargoes or other trade restrictions as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change conflict minerals and responsible sourcing practices which can limit the supply of our materials andor increase the cost 

marketing and customers 

we continue to transform how we interact with our customers from transactional opportunistic sales of standardized memory components to collaborative relationships where we work with our customers to understand their unique opportunities and challenges many of our customers require thorough review or qualification of our products by engaging with our customers early in the product lifecycle to identify and design features and performance characteristics into our products we are able to manufacture products that anticipate and address their changing needs collaborating with our customers on their design needs in a changing end market allows us to differentiate our memory and storage solutions which provides greater value to our customers 

our semiconductor memory and storage products are offered under our micron crucial and ballistix brand names and through private labels we market our semiconductor memory and storage products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world we sell our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives distributors and retailers our independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and we make shipments against the orders directly to our customers our distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products 

in each of the last three years approximately onehalf of our total net sales were to our top ten customers for other information regarding our concentrations and customers see part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – certain concentrations 

backlog 

because of volatile industry conditions customers are generally reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our memory and storage products may fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the time of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

product warranty 

because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with applicable specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products comply with applicable specifications existing at the time of delivery and will operate to those specifications during a stated warranty period under our standard terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions 

competition 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc toshiba memory corporation and western digital corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage our competitors generally seek to increase wafer capacity improve yields and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some of our competitors have plans to ramp or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have cost or performance advantages certain of our memory and storage products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors for these products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factors 

some governments have provided and may continue to provide significant assistance financial or otherwise to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries andor competitors in particular we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the chinese government and various stateowned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance chinas stated national policy objectives in addition the chinese government may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies some of our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share or take business of our key customers 

research and development 

our rd efforts are focused primarily on development of product and process technology that enables continuous improvement to cost structures and performance enhancements for our future products we are also focused on developing new fundamentally different memory structures materials and packages designed to facilitate our transition to next generation products additional rd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing storage and mobile memory architectures and the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise product design and development efforts include highdensity ddr4 ddr5 lpddr4 lpddr5 and advanced graphics dram 3d nand including 96layer and 128layer tlc and qlc technologies 3d xpoint technology hbm technology ssds including firmware and controllers managed nand specialty memory and other memory technologies and systems 

to compete in the semiconductor memory and storage markets we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes the continued evolution of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for memory and storage products and solutions our process design and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world our largest rd center is located in boise idaho and other product and process development centers are located in japan china germany italy india singapore taiwan and other sites in the united states 

rd expenses vary with the number of development wafers processed and endproduct solutions developed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance and reliability as a result rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 

we have had agreements to share the cost of certain product and process development activities under development agreements with partners including agreements with intel to jointly develop nand and 3d xpoint technologies amounts received from our development partners for reimbursements under our costsharing arrangements are reflected as reductions of rd expenses we substantially completed our nand technology costsharing arrangement with intel in the third quarter of 2019 and our 3d xpoint arrangement in the first quarter of 2020

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors the order of which is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each poses to us which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or stock price our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant 

volatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products may adversely affect our business 

we have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices including dramatic declines as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such volatility in the future in some prior periods average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 



we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins 

our gross margins are dependent in part upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs including but not limited to process linewidth additional 3d memory layers additional bits per cell ie cell levels architecture number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and yield in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins factors that may limit our ability to maintain or reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes difficulties in transitioning to smaller linewidth process technologies 3d memory layers nand cell levels transitioning to replacement gate technology for nand process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps manufacturing yield technological barriers changes in process technologies and new products that may require relatively larger die sizes 

many factors may result in a reduction of our output or a delay in ramping production which could lead to underutilization of our production assets these factors may include among others a weak demand environment industry oversupply inventory surpluses declining selling prices and changes in supply agreements a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are fixed and do not vary proportionally with changes in production output as a result lower utilization and increases in our per gigabit manufacturing costs may adversely affect our gross margins business results of operations or financial condition 

in addition per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by a broader product portfolio which may have smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles our business and the markets we serve are subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on enduser preferences as a result we may have work in process or finished goods inventories that could become obsolete or in amounts that are in excess of our customers demand as a result we may incur charges in connection with obsolete or excess inventories which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition our inability to maintain or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc toshiba memory corporation and western digital corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry 

competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments have provided and may continue to provide significant assistance financial or otherwise to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries andor competitors in particular we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the chinese government and various stateowned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance chinas stated national policy objectives in addition the chinese government may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies some of our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share or take business of our key customers 

our competitors generally seek to increase wafer capacity improve yields and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some of our competitors have plans to ramp or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand could lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have cost or performance advantages 

the competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold average selling prices and manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technology support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rd and product and process technology 

we estimate that capital expenditures in 2020 for property plant and equipment net of partner contributions will be approximately 7 billion to 8 billion focused on technology transitions and product enablement investments in capital expenditures may not generate expected returns or cash flows delays in completion and ramping of new production facilities could significantly impact our ability to realize expected returns on our capital expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings of mmj initiated in 2012 and for so long as such proceedings are continuing mmj is prohibited from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and such proceedings require that excess earnings be used in mmjs business or to fund the mmj creditor payments in addition pursuant to an order of the tokyo district court mmj cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the tokyo district court and may under certain circumstances be subject to approval of the legal trustee as a result the assets of mmj are not available for use by us in our other operations furthermore certain uses of the assets of mmj including certain capital expenditures of mmj may require consent of mmjs trustees andor the tokyo district court 

in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our debt levels expected debt amortization and general economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us we have experienced volatility in our cash flows and operating results and may continue to experience such volatility in the future which may negatively affect our credit rating our credit rating may also be affected by our liquidity financial results economic risk or other factors which may increase the cost of future borrowings and make it difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us in 2019 we suspended the security interest in the collateral under our credit facility upon achieving specified credit ratings and the prepayment of our 2022 term loan b however the security interest would be automatically reinstated upon a decline in our corporate credit rating below a certain level there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

increases in tariffs or other trade restrictions or taxes on our or our customers products or equipment and supplies could have an adverse impact on our operations 

in 2019 89 of our revenue was from products shipped to customer locations outside the united states we also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside the united states additionally a significant portion of our facilities are located outside the united states including in taiwan singapore japan and china 

the united states and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods general trade tensions between the us and china have been escalating since 2018 with us tariffs on chinese goods and retaliatory chinese tariffs on us goods some of our products are included in these tariffs higher duties on existing tariffs and further rounds of tariffs have been announced or threatened by us and chinese leaders additionally the us has threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from other countries which could also impact certain of our customers or our operations if the us were to impose current or additional tariffs on components that we or our suppliers source our cost for such components would increase we may also incur increases in manufacturing costs and supply chain risks due to our efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and our operations additionally tariffs on our customers products could impact their sales of such end products resulting in lower demand for our products 

we cannot predict what further actions may ultimately be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the us and other countries what products may be subject to such actions or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation further changes in trade policy tariffs additional taxes restrictions on exports or other trade barriers or restrictions on supplies equipment and raw materials including rare earth minerals may limit our ability to produce products increase our selling andor manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

us trade regulations have restricted our ability to sell our products to a significant customer and could restrict our ability to sell our products to other customers 

on may 16 2019 the bureau of industry and security bis of the us department of commerce added huawei to the biss entity list which imposes limitations on the supply of certain us items and product support to huawei in 2019 our sales to huawei accounted for 12  of our total revenue to ensure compliance with the entity list restrictions we suspended shipments of all products to huawei effective may 16 2019 we are reviewing our product portfolio to determine whether our products and related support are subject to the export administration regulations and therefore within the scope of the entity list restrictions we have determined that certain products huawei purchases from us are not subject to the export administration regulations and consequently can be lawfully sold and shipped to huawei accordingly we resumed shipping certain products to huawei in the fourth quarter of 2019 

while huawei remains on the entity list and in the absence of a license from the bis we may be unable to work with huawei on future product development which may have a negative effect on our ability to sell products to huawei in the future entity list restrictions may also encourage huawei to seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our competitors that are not subject to these restrictions thereby decreasing our longterm competitiveness as a supplier to huawei moreover although huawei is not prohibited from paying and we are not restricted from collecting accounts receivable for products we sell to huawei the credit risks associated with these accounts may have increased as a result of the biss actions 

we cannot predict what additional actions the us government may take with respect to huawei including modifications to or interpretations of entity list restrictions export restrictions tariffs or other trade limitations or barriers due to the customized nature of certain of the products we manufacture we may be unable to sell certain finished goods inventory to an alternative customer or manufacture inprocess inventory to different specifications which may result in excess and obsolescence charges in future periods 

the entity list trade restrictions enacted during our third quarter of 2019 had an adverse effect on our business we are unable to predict the duration of the export restrictions imposed with respect to huawei whether any licenses will be issued or the longterm effects on our business other companies may be added to the entity list andor subject to trade restrictions for example in october 2019 the us government added several additional chinese organizations to the entity list effective october 9 2019 in addition there may be indirect impacts to our business which we cannot reasonably quantify including that some of our other customers products which incorporate our solutions may also be impacted by these and other trade restrictions that may be imposed by the us china or other countries restrictions on our ability to sell and ship our products to huawei have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

in addition restrictions on our ability to sell and ship our products to other organizations added to the entity list may have a further adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory and storage technologies 

our key semiconductor memory and storage products and technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on stacking additional 3d memory layers increasing bits per cell ie cell levels meeting higher density requirements and improving power consumption and reliability we may face technological barriers to continue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate which has generally reduced perunit cost we have invested and expect to continue to invest in rd for new and existing products which involves significant risk and uncertainties we may be unable to recover our investment in rd or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die size or increasing memory and storage densities our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance andor cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies there can be no assurance of the following 

 

we develop and produce advanced memory technologies including 3d xpoint memory a new class of nonvolatile technology there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market new product technologies will be successful unsuccessful efforts to develop new semiconductor memory and storage technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated with a select number of customers 

in each of the last three years approximately onehalf of our total revenue was from our top ten customers a disruption in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our business we could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve in addition any consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products could be sold our inability to meet our customers requirements or to qualify our products with them could adversely impact our revenue the loss of one or more of our major customers or any significant reduction in orders from or a shift in product mix by these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

in 2019 53 of our revenue was to customers who have headquarters located in the united states we ship our products to the locations specified by our customers customers with global supply chains and operations may request we deliver products to countries where they own or operate production facilities or to countries where they utilize thirdparty subcontractors or warehouses as a result 89 of our revenue was from products shipped to customer locations outside the united states in addition a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states in particular a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore taiwan japan and china many of our customers suppliers and vendors operate internationally and are also subject to the risks described below in addition the us government has in the past restricted american firms from selling products and software to certain of our customers and may in the future impose similar bans or other restrictions on sales to one or more of our significant customers these restrictions may not prohibit our competitors from selling similar products to our customers which may result in our loss of sales and market share even when such restrictions are lifted financial or other penalties or continuing export restrictions imposed with respect to our customers could have a continuing negative impact on our future revenue and results of operations and we may not be able to recover any customers or market share we lose while complying with such restrictions we have experienced restrictions on our ability to sell products to certain foreign customers where sales of products require export licenses or are prohibited by government action possible future us government actions could lead to additional or enhanced controls on exports from the united states to china or other countries bans on sales to other key customers or other similar restrictions 

traderelated government actions by china or other countries that impose barriers or restrictions that would impact our ability to sell or ship products to huawei or other customers may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict the actions government entities may take in this context and may be unable to quickly offset or 

effectively react to government actions that restrict our ability to sell to certain customers or in certain jurisdictions government actions that affect our customers ability to sell products or access critical elements of their supply chains may result in a decreased demand for their products which may consequently reduce their demand for our products 

our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

if we or our customers suppliers or vendors are impacted by these risks it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have been served with complaints in chinese courts alleging patent infringement 

we have been served with complaints in chinese courts alleging that we infringe certain chinese patents by manufacturing and selling certain products in china the complaints seek orders requiring us to destroy inventory of the accused products and equipment for manufacturing the accused products in china to stop manufacturing using selling and offering for sale the accused products in china and to pay damages plus court fees 

we are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions of infringement made against us and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our operations in china products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see part ii financial information – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – contingencies 

we are subject to allegations of anticompetitive conduct 

on april 27 2018 a complaint was filed against micron and other dram suppliers in the us district court for the northern district of california subsequently two substantially identical cases were filed in the same court the lawsuits purport to be on behalf of a nationwide class of indirect purchasers of dram products the complaints assert claims based on alleged pricefixing of dram products under federal and state law during the period from june 1 2016 to february 1 2018 and seek treble monetary damages costs interest attorneys fees and other injunctive and equitable relief on september 3 2019 the district court granted microns motion to dismiss and allowed plaintiffs the opportunity to file an amended complaint 

on june 26 2018 a complaint was filed against micron and other dram suppliers in the us district court for the northern district of california subsequently four substantially identical cases were filed in the same court the lawsuits purport to be on behalf of a nationwide class of direct purchasers of dram products the complaints assert claims based on alleged pricefixing of dram products under federal and state law during the period from june 1 2016 to february 1 2018 and seek treble monetary damages costs interest attorneys fees and other injunctive and equitable relief 

additionally six cases have been filed in the following canadian courts superior court of quebec the federal court of canada the ontario superior court of justice and the supreme court of british columbia the substantive allegations in these cases are similar to those asserted in the cases filed in the united states 

on may 15 2018 the chinese state administration for market regulation samr notified micron that it was investigating potential collusion and other anticompetitive conduct by dram suppliers in china on may 31 2018 samr made unannounced visits to our sales offices in beijing shanghai and shenzhen to seek certain information as part of its investigation we are cooperating with samr in its investigation 

we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of these matters could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by the limited availability and quality of materials supplies and capital equipment or the dependency on thirdparty service providers 

our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services we generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials and services that meet our standards and in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of materials or components such as chemicals silicon wafers gases photoresist controllers substrates lead frames printed circuit boards targets and reticle glass blanks shortages or increases in lead times may occur from time to time in the future our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with thirdparty manufacturers of controllers used in a number of our products and with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers contract manufacturers logistic carriers and other service providers 

certain materials are primarily available in certain countries including rare earth elements minerals and metals available primarily from china trade disputes or other political or economic conditions may limit our availability to obtain such materials although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers china is the predominant producer of certain of these materials if china were to stop exporting these materials our suppliers ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities or obtain supply in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost constrained supply of rare earth elements minerals and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from china 

we andor our suppliers and service providers could be affected by tariffs embargoes or other trade restrictions as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change conflict minerals and responsible sourcing practices which could limit the supply of our materials andor increase the cost environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials lead times for the supply of materials have been extended in the past the disruption of our supply of materials components services or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers limited capacity our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and could increase our overall costs of a ramp our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

new product and market development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products including systemlevel memory and storage products and solutions which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technology and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product and systemlevel solution development over the next several years additionally we are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands of our customers which increases our reliance on our customers ability to accurately forecast the 

endcustomers needs and preferences as a result our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers for certain of our markets it is important that we deliver products in a timely manner with increasingly advanced performance characteristics at the time our customers are designing and evaluating samples for their products if we do not meet their product design schedules our customers may excluded us from further consideration as a supplier for those products the process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance often well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers in addition some of our components have long leadtimes requiring us to place orders several months in advance of anticipated demand such long leadtimes increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand there can be no assurance of the following 

 • that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 

our unsuccessful efforts to develop new products and solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

increases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop and qualify our system solutions 

our development of systemlevel memory and storage products is dependent in part upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers specifications for those products developing and manufacturing systemlevel products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products in sufficient volume quantity and in a timely manner if we fail to identify or develop products on a timely basis or at all that comply with our customers specifications or achieve design wins with our customers we may experience a significant adverse impact on our revenues and margins even if our products meet customer specifications our sales of systemlevel solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices our competitors products may be less costly provide better performance or include additional features when compared to our products our longterm ability to sell systemlevel memory and storage products is reliant upon our customers ability to create market and sell their products containing our systemlevel solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner if we fail to successfully develop and market systemlevel products our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

even if we are successful in selling systemlevel solutions to our customers in sufficient volume we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our perunit manufacturing costs exceed our perunit selling prices manufacturing systemlevel solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle as compared to discrete products to design test and qualify which may increase our costs additionally some of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications which increases our costs and time to market additionally we may need to update our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications andor industry standards which increases our costs system complexities and extended warranties for systemlevel products could also increase our warranty costs our failure to costeffectively manufacture systemlevel solutions andor firmware in a timely manner may result in reduced demand for our systemlevel products and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

products that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application our products and solutions may be deemed fully or partially responsible for functions in our customers products and may result in sharing or shifting of product or financial liability from our customers to us for 

costs incurred by the end user as a result of our customers products failing to perform as specified we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

 

any of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property 

we maintain a system of controls over our intellectual property including us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets licensing arrangements confidentiality procedures nondisclosure agreements with employees consultants and vendors and a general system of internal controls despite our system of controls over our intellectual property it may be possible for our current or future competitors to obtain copy use or disclose illegally or otherwise our product and process technology or other proprietary information the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do us laws and our confidentiality nondisclosure and noncompete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce 

additionally our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract develop and retain highly skilled employees global competition for such skilled employees in our industry is intense due to the volatile nature of our industry and our operating results a decline in our operating results andor stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees whose compensation is dependent in part upon the market price of our common stock achieving certain performance metrics levels of company profitability or other financial or companywide performance if our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees they may directly benefit from the knowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment 

our inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

claims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon misappropriate misuse or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights we are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions made against us any of these types of claims regardless of the merits could subject us to significant costs to defend or resolve such claims and may consume a substantial portion of managements time and attention as a result of these claims we may be required to 

 

we may not be able to take any of the actions described above on commercially reasonable terms and any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see part ii financial information – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – contingencies 

we have a number of intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make onetime or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are 

unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us the failure to obtain or renew licenses as necessary could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

from time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business or otherwise both domestically and internationally any claim with or without merit could result in significant legal fees that could negatively impact our financial results disrupt our operations and require significant attention from our management we could be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising from our relationships with vendors or customers supply agreements or contractual obligations with our subcontractors or business partners we may also be associated with and subject to litigation arising from the actions of our subcontractors or business partners we may also be subject to litigation as a result of indemnities we issue primarily with our customers the terms of our product warranties and from product liability claims as we continue to focus on developing system solutions with manufacturers of consumer products including autonomous driving augmented reality and others we may be exposed to greater potential for personal liability claims against us as a result of consumers use of those products there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities and we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters exposures to various litigation could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend claims are required to pay damage awards or enter into settlement agreements any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to allegations of securities violations and related wrongful acts 

on march 5 2019 a shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the us district court for the district of delaware allegedly on behalf of and for the benefit of micron against certain current and former officers and directors of micron for alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties and other violations of law the allegations are based on among other things purported false and misleading statements regarding anticompetitive behavior in the dram industry the complaint seeks damages fees interest costs and other appropriate relief similar shareholder derivative complaints have subsequently been filed in the us district court for the district of delaware and the us district court for the district of idaho 

we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of these matters could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our manufacturing process is disrupted by operational issues natural disasters or other events our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we and our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the united states singapore taiwan japan malaysia and china additionally until we complete our acquisition of intels noncontrolling interest in imft our control over operations at imft is limited by our agreements with intel from time to time there have been disruptions in the manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment disruptions in supply of raw materials or components or equipment failures we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations if production is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business 

downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers mobile devices ssds and servers reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions 

may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result a downturn in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

breaches of our security systems or those of our customers suppliers or business partners could expose us to losses 

we maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities we also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations in addition we process store and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees including sensitive personal information unauthorized persons or employees may gain access to our facilities or network systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information compromise confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities breaches of our physical security and attacks on our network systems or breaches or attacks on our customers suppliers or business partners who have confidential or sensitive information regarding us and our customers and suppliers could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers suppliers or employees is compromised the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks 

we have entered into strategic relationships to develop new manufacturing process technologies and products and to manufacture certain products including our joint development partnership and our imft joint venture with intel in january 2019 we exercised our option to acquire intels interest in imft subsequently intel set the closing date to occur on october 31 2019 in the first quarter of 2020 we expect to pay intel approximately 14 billion  in cash for intels noncontrolling interest in imft and imft member debt as of august 29 2019 current debt included 693 million  of imft member debt 

our joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations including the following 

  

• diverging interests between us and our partners and disagreements on the following 

 • competition from our partners 

• access by our partners to our proprietary product and process technology which they may use 

• difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures 

• difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint ventures 

• limited control over the operations of our joint ventures 

• inability of our partners to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures 

 • inadequate cash flows to fund increased capital requirements of our joint ventures 

• difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partners 

 • changes in tax legal or regulatory requirements that necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners 

our pending acquisition of intels noncontrolling interest in imft may involve additional risks including but not limited to an inability to sell the product imft produces increases in underutilization charges increase in rd expenses retention of key employees and successful integration of imft 

our joint ventures and strategic relationships if unsuccessful could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition 

we have incurred in the past and expect to incur in the future debt to finance our capital investments business acquisitions and restructuring of our capital structure as of august 29 2019  we had debt with a carrying value of 585 billion  as of august 29 2019  we also had an undrawn credit facility totaling 375 billion consisting of 1 an undrawn revolving credit facility that matures in july 2023 and provides for borrowings of up to 250 billion and 2 a term loan facility 

for up to 125 billion available to be drawn in a single advance prior to november 9 2019 as of august 29 2019  the conversion value in excess of principal of our convertible notes was 654 million  based on the trading price of our common stock of 4467  per share on such date 

our debt obligations could adversely impact us for example these obligations could 

 

our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future this to some extent is subject to market economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs additionally events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable drawdown conditions and utilize our revolving credit facility in 2019 we suspended the security interest in the collateral under our credit facility upon achieving a specified credit rating and prepaying the 2022 term loan b however if our corporate credit rating were to decline below a certain level the security interest would be automatically reinstated if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we must attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees 

to remain competitive we must attract retain and motivate executives and other highly skilled employees competition for experienced employees in our industry can be intense and hiring and retaining qualified executives engineers technical staff and sales representatives are critical to our business our inability to attract and retain key employees may inhibit our ability to maintain or expand our business operations additionally changes to immigration policies in the numerous countries in which we operate including the united states may limit our ability to hire andor retain talent in specific locations if our total compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda 

on january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimondas insolvency proceedings filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor bv micron bv in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron bv and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron bv purchased substantially all of qimondas shares of inotera the inotera shares representing approximately 18 of inoteras outstanding shares as of august 29 2019  and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks among other things to recover damages for the alleged 

value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent crosslicense between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement 

following a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate on march 13 2014 the court issued judgments 1 ordering micron bv to pay approximately 1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase 2 ordering micron bv to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties 3 ordering micron bv to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares including in particular any profits distributed on the inotera shares and all other benefits 4 denying qimondas claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera and 5 determining that qimondas obligations under the patent crosslicense agreement are canceled in addition the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering among other things 1 that micron bv transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by micron bv and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties and 2 that micron bv pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by micron bv from ownership of the inotera shares the interlocutory judgments have no immediate enforceable effect on us and accordingly we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case on april 17 2014 micron and micron bv filed a notice of appeal with the german appeals court challenging the district courts decision after opening briefs the appeals court held a hearing on the matter on july 9 2015 and thereafter appointed two independent experts to perform an evaluation of dr jaffés claims that the amount micron paid for qimonda was less than fair market value on january 25 2018 the courtappointed experts issued their report concluding that the amount paid by micron was within an acceptable fairvalue range the appeals court held a subsequent hearing on april 30 2019 and on may 28 2019 the appeals court remanded the case to the experts for supplemental expert opinion 

we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron bv from the ownership of the inotera shares andor the termination of the patent crosslicense which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

we operate in a number of locations outside the united states including singapore where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the geographic mix of our earnings among these jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing arrangements failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements expanding our operations in various countries and changes in tax laws and regulations additionally we file income tax returns with the us federal government various us states and various other jurisdictions throughout the world and certain tax returns may remain open to examination for several years the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a change in tax laws in key jurisdictions could materially increase our tax expense 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition for example our effective tax rate increased from 12  for 2018 to 98  for 2019 primarily as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22 2017 by the united states the us treasury department continues to issue interpretive guidance on the tax act including foreign tax credits foreign minimum tax foreign derived intangible income and interest expense deduction limitations it is anticipated that the guidance will be finalized over the next several months additionally various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative actions to increase tax revenue further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development which represents a coalition of member countries and recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles if adopted by countries such changes as well as changes in us federal and state tax laws or in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our incentives from various governments are conditional upon achieving or maintaining certain performance obligations and are subject to reduction termination or clawback 

we have received and may in the future continue to receive benefits and incentives from national state and local governments in various regions of the world designed to encourage us to establish maintain or increase investment workforce or production in those regions these incentives may take various forms including grants loan subsidies and tax arrangements and typically require us to perform or maintain certain levels of investment capital spending employment technology deployment or research and development activities to qualify for such incentives we cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve performance obligations required to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide such funding these incentive arrangements typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our performance with the terms and obligations such audits could result in modifications to or termination of the applicable incentive program the incentives we receive could be subject to reduction termination or clawback and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may make future acquisitions andor alliances which involve numerous risks 

acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 

 

in previous years supply of memory and storage products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices the global memory and storage industry has experienced consolidation and may continue to consolidate we engage from time to time in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

across our global operations significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the euro singapore dollar new taiwan dollar and yen although we hedge our primary exposures to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies exchange rates for some of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the yen have been volatile in recent periods if these currencies strengthen against the us dollar our manufacturing costs could significantly increase exchange rates for the us dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur additional restructuring charges in future periods 

from time to time we have and may in the future enter into restructure initiatives in order to among other items streamline our operations respond to changes in business conditions our markets or product offerings or to centralize certain key functions we may not realize expected savings or other benefits from our restructure activities and may incur additional restructure charges or other losses in future periods associated with other initiatives in connection with any restructure initiatives we could incur restructure charges loss of production output loss of key personnel disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

compliance with customer and responsible sourcing requirements and related regulations could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain materials supplies and services used in manufacturing our products 

many of our customers have adopted responsible sourcing programs that require us to periodically report on our supply chain and responsible sourcing efforts to ensure we source the materials supplies and services we use and incorporate into the products we sell in a manner that is consistent with their programs some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products meet the specifications of their responsible sourcing programs meeting customer requirements may limit the sourcing and availability of some of the materials supplies and services we use particularly when the availability of such is concentrated to a limited number of suppliers this in turn may affect our ability andor the cost to obtain materials supplies and services necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities 

this increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 and its implementing sec regulations the act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo and finance or benefit local armed groups these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors 

our inability to comply with customers requirements for responsible sourcing or with regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we and others are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that may result in additional costs and liabilities 

the manufacturing of our products requires the use of facilities equipment and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate additionally we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction maintenance and operations of our facilities any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results additionally we engage various third parties to represent us or otherwise act on our behalf and we partner with other companies in our joint ventures all of whom are also subject to a broad array of laws and regulations our engagement with these third parties and our ownership in these joint ventures may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with these laws and regulations as a result of these items we could experience the following 

 

our failure or the failure of our thirdparty agents or joint ventures to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to counterparty default risks 

we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash deposits investments capped call contracts on our common stock and derivative instruments as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations a counterparty may 

not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings in the event of such default we could incur significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

consolidated results 

  



total revenue 

total revenue for 2019 decreased 23 as compared to 2018 primarily due to pricing declines resulting from the challenging memory market environment in 2019 sales of dram products for 2019 decreased 28 as compared to 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices of approximately 30 resulting from supply and demand imbalances customer inventory corrections and cpu shortages sales of nand products for 2019 decreased 12 as compared to 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices in the mid40 range resulting from supply and demand imbalances which were partially offset by significant increases in sales volumes in addition demand for our nand products was adversely affected by the transition from sata ssds to nvme ssds the higher nand sales volumes in 2019 were driven by increases in sales of highvalue mobile managed nand products as well as discrete nand products enabled by our execution in ramping 64 and 96layer tlc 3d nand 

total revenue for 2018 increased 50 as compared to 2017 higher revenue in 2018 for both dram and nand as compared to 2017 were driven by strong execution in delivering highvalue products featuring our 1xnm dram and 64layer 3d nand technologies combined with strong demand for products across our primary markets sales of dram products for 2018 increased 64 from 2017 primarily due to an increase in average selling prices of approximately 35 and an increase in sales volumes of approximately 20 as a result of strong market conditions particularly for cloud enterprise mobile and graphics markets combined with increased sales into highvalue markets sales of nand products for 2018 increased 20 from 2017 despite declines in average selling prices primarily due to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 30 driven by increases in sales of highvalue ssd and mobile managed nand products enabled by strong demand and our execution in delivering 3d nand products 

overall gross margin 

our overall gross margin percentage decreased to 46 for 2019 from 59 for 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by cost reductions resulting from strong execution in delivering products featuring advanced technologies and from continuous improvement initiatives to reduce production costs underutilization of imft assets adversely impacted our gross margin by a perquarter average of approximately 100 million in 2019 and 65 million in 2018 and we anticipate the adverse impact of underutilization at imft to increase to approximately 150 million per quarter beginning in the first quarter of 2020 

we continue to evaluate planned technology node transitions capital spending and reuse rates for nand equipment based on our preliminary assessment we anticipate changing the depreciable life of our nand equipment from five to seven years beginning in the first quarter of 2020 we anticipate this change will reduce our depreciation expense included in cost of goods sold for the first quarter of 2020 by approximately 80 million increasing to approximately 100 to 150 million per quarter for the remainder of 2020 

our overall gross margin percentage increased to 59 for 2018 from 42 for 2017 primarily due to favorable market conditions across key markets combined with strong execution in delivering products featuring advanced technologies including 1xnm dram and 64layer 3d nand enabling manufacturing cost reductions for 2018 as compared to 2017 pricing for dram products increased while manufacturing costs declined and for nand products manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices

cnbu operating income for 2018 improved from 2017 primarily due to improved pricing and higher sales volumes resulting from strong demand for our products combined with manufacturing cost reductions mbu operating income for 2018 improved from 2017 primarily due to increases in pricing and sales volumes for lpdram products higher sales of highvalue managed nand products and manufacturing cost reductions sbu operating income for 2018 improved from 2017 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions enabled by our execution in transitioning to 64layer tlc 3d nand products and improvements in product mix sbu operating income for 2018 was adversely impacted by higher costs associated with imfts production of 3d xpoint memory products at less than full capacity ebu operating income for 2018 increased as compared to 2017 as a result of increases in average selling prices manufacturing cost reductions and increases in sales volumes partially offset by higher rd costs 

operating expenses and other 

selling general and administrative 

sga expenses for 2019 were 3 higher than 2018 primarily due to increases in legal costs and consulting fees partially offset by a reduction in employee compensation and sales commissions sga expenses for 2018 were 9 higher than 2017 primarily due to increases in legal costs consulting fees and employee compensation 

research and development 

rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed amounts reimbursed under rd costsharing agreements the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 

rd expenses for 2019 were 14 higher than 2018 primarily due to decreases in reimbursements from our rd costsharing arrangements as described below increases in depreciation expense as a result of increases in capital spending and increases in employee compensation rd expenses for 2018 were 17 higher than 2017 primarily due to increases in employee compensation volumes of development and prequalification wafers and depreciation expense as a result of increases in capital spending 

we share the cost of certain product and process development activities under development agreements with partners including agreements to jointly develop nand and 3d xpoint technologies with intel our rd expenses were reduced by reimbursements under these development partner arrangements by 60 million  201 million  and 213 million  for 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively the decrease in rd reimbursements for 2019 was primarily due to reductions in our joint development activities with intel for 3d nand and 3d xpoint technologies in 2018 we and intel agreed to independently develop subsequent generations of 3d nand and we substantially completed this costsharing agreement in the third quarter of 2019 in 2018 we announced that we and intel will no longer jointly develop 3d xpoint technology beyond the second generation and we substantially completed this costsharing agreement in the first quarter of 2020 

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which imposed a onetime transition tax in 2018 the repatriation tax and beginning in 2019 created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings the foreign minimum tax in connection with the provisions of the tax act we made an accounting policy election to treat the foreign minimum tax provision as a period cost in the period the tax is incurred sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 allowed the use of provisional amounts reasonable estimates if the analyses of the impacts of the tax act had not been completed when financial statements were issued during 

2019 we finalized the computations of the income tax effects of the tax act as such in accordance with sab 118 our accounting for the effects of the tax act is complete 

our income tax provision benefit consisted of the following 



our effective tax rate increased in 2019 primarily as a result of the foreign minimum tax our income tax rates include operations outside the united states including singapore where we have tax incentive arrangements that further decrease our effective tax rates 

as a result of the tax act we reevaluated our indefinite reinvestment assertion in 2018 and deemed a portion of our accumulated foreign earnings to be no longer indefinitely reinvested although these earnings have been subject to us federal income tax under the repatriation tax the repatriation to the united states of all or a portion of these earnings would potentially be subject to foreign withholding and state income tax as of august 29 2019  we had a deferred tax liability of 10 million  associated with our undistributed earnings 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside the unites states including singapore where we have tax incentive arrangements which expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2034 that are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds the effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by 756 million  benefiting our diluted earnings per share by 066  for 2019  by 196 billion   159  per diluted share for 2018  and by 742 million   064  per diluted share for 2017  

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – income taxes 

other 

interest income increased 71 for 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to increases in interest rates interest expense decreased 63 as compared to 2018 primarily due to prepayments repurchases and conversions of debt in 2018 and 2019 and increases in capitalized interest from higher levels of capital spending partially offset by the issuance of the 2024 notes 2026 notes 2027 notes 2029 notes and 2030 notes in 2019 

interest income increased 193 for 2018 as compared to 2017 primarily due to increases in marketable investments and interest rates interest expense decreased 43 as compared to 2017 primarily due to decreases in debt obligations

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products which can vary significantly from period to period we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations we expect from time to time to engage in a variety of financing transactions for such purposes including the issuance of securities as of august 29 2019  we had undrawn credit facilities totaling 375 billion consisting of 1 an undrawn revolving credit facility that matures in july 2023 and provides for borrowings of up to 250 billion and 2 a term loan facility of up to 125 billion available to be drawn in a single advance prior to november 9 2019 which matures on the fifth anniversary of the funding date we expect to draw under the term loan facility prior to acquiring intels interest in imft in the first quarter of 2020 we expect that our cash and investments cash flows from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months 

to develop new product and process technology support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and equipment and rd we estimate that capital expenditures in 2020 for property plant and equipment net of partner contributions to be 7 billion to 8 billion focused on technology transitions and product enablement the actual amounts for 2020 will vary depending on market conditions as of august 29 2019  we had commitments of approximately 43 billion  for the acquisition of property plant and equipment approximately 32 billion  is expected to be paid in 2020 and the remainder in 2021 

our board of directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to 10 billion  of our outstanding common stock beginning in 2019 which we may purchase on a discretionary basis through openmarket purchases block trades privatelynegotiated transactions derivative transactions andor pursuant to a rule 10b51 trading plan subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash the repurchase authorization does not obligate us to acquire any common stock in 2019 we repurchased 67 million  shares of our common stock for 266 billion  under an accelerated share repurchase agreement rule 10b51 plans and through open market repurchases see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – equity 

in january 2019 we exercised our option to acquire intels interest in imft intel has set the closing date to occur on october 31 2019 in connection with our acquisition in the first quarter of 2020 we expect to pay intel approximately 14 billion  for intels interest in imft as well as imft member debt owed to intel as of august 29 2019 current debt included 693 million  of imft member debt 

cash and marketable investments totaled 912 billion  as of august 29 2019  and 728 billion  as of august 30 2018  our investments consist primarily of money market funds and liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers to mitigate credit risk we invest through highcreditquality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor as of august 29 2019  250 billion of our cash and marketable investments was held by our foreign subsidiaries 

limitations on the use of cash and investments 

mmj group    cash and marketable investments as of august 29 2019  included 536 million held by the mmj group as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings of mmj initiated in march 2012 and for so long as such proceedings are continuing the mmj group is prohibited from paying dividends to us in addition pursuant to an order of the tokyo district court the mmj group cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the tokyo district court and may under certain circumstances be subject to the approval of the legal trustee as a result the assets of the mmj group are not available for use by us in our other operations furthermore certain uses of the assets of the mmj group including investments in certain capital expenditures may require consent of mmjs trustees andor the tokyo district court 

imft   cash and marketable investments included 130 million  held by imft as of august 29 2019  our ability to access funds held by imft to finance our other operations is subject to agreement by intel and contractual limitations amounts held by imft are not anticipated to be available to finance our other operations 

cash flows 



operating activities   for 2019 cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to cash generated by our operations and the effect of working capital adjustments which included a 243 billion decrease in receivables due to a lower level of net sales and a 153 billion increase in inventory due to higher levels of work in process and raw materials inventories

potential settlement obligations of convertible notes 

since the closing price of our common stock exceeded 130  of the conversion price per share of all our convertible notes for at least 20  trading days in the 30  trading day period ended on september 30 2019 holders may convert these notes through the calendar quarter ended december 31 2019 the following table summarizes the potential settlements that we could be required to make for the calendar quarter ending december 31 2019 if all holders converted their notes the amounts in the table below are based on our closing share price of 4467  as of august 29 2019  



as of august 29 2019  convertible notes in the table above included an aggregate of 179 million  net carrying amount for the settlement obligation including principal and amounts in excess of principal for conversions of 2033f notes the 20  consecutive trading day measurement period ended in the first quarter of 2020 and we settled the conversion for 192 million  in cash in the first quarter of 2020 

contractual obligations 



 

the timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is based on current information any redemptions repurchases or conversions of debt could impact the amount and timing of our cash payments 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with our 2033f notes we entered into the 2033f capped calls which are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – equity – micron shareholders equity – outstanding capped calls 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

business acquisitions  accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized in subsequent periods accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred we typically obtain independent thirdparty valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows discount rates and comparable market values items involving significant assumptions estimates and judgments include the following 

 

consolidation  we have interests in entities that are vies determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing whether an entity is a vie and if we are the entitys primary beneficiary if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we are required to consolidate it to determine if we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies require significant assumptions and judgments 

contingencies  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss if any from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date in accounting for the resolution of contingencies significant judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods 

goodwill and intangible assets   we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform the goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the reporting unit for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value goodwill is tested 

for impairment by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then we would record an impairment loss up to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value 

determining when to test for impairment the reporting units the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates forecasted manufacturing costs and other expenses and are developed as part of our longrange planning process the same estimates are used in business planning forecasting and capital budgeting as part of our longterm manufacturing capacity analysis we test the reasonableness of the output of our longrange planning process by calculating an implied value per share and comparing that to current stock prices analysts consensus pricing and managements expectations these estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit which are discounted using a riskadjusted rate to estimate a fair value the discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates during the fourth quarter of 2019 we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10 decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit 

we test other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows estimating fair values involves significant assumptions including future sales prices sales volumes costs and discount rates 

income taxes   we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of the applicable fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in recent periods our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and the united states our income tax provision or benefit is dependent in part on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve significant judgments including among others projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes manufacturing and overhead costs levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value cost includes depreciation labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining net realizable value of inventories involves significant judgments including projecting future average selling prices and future sales volumes to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated net realizable values below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when inventories are actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our inventory by approximately 469 million as of august 29 2019 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory and storage markets actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories we review the major characteristics of product type and markets in determining the unit of account for which we perform the lower of average cost or net realizable value analysis and categorize inventories primarily as memory including dram nand and other memory 

property plant and equipment  we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment based on technology node transitions capital spending and equipment reuse rates we also review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimate of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require significant judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition significant judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

research and development  costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires significant judgment we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are included in cost of goods sold 

revenue recognition   revenue is primarily recognized at a point in time when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods contracts with our customers are generally shortterm in duration at fixed negotiated prices with payment generally due shortly after delivery we estimate a liability for returns using the expected value method based on historical rates of return in addition we generally offer price protection to our distributors which is a form of variable consideration that decreases the transaction price we use the expected value method based on historical price adjustments and current pricing trends to estimate the amount of revenue recognized from sales to distributors differences between the estimated and actual amounts are recognized as adjustments to revenue 

stockbased compensation   stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on our assessment of the likelihood of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires significant judgment 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires significant judgment including estimating stock price volatility and expected option life we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock options and awards granted under our employee stock purchase plan we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio as of august 29 2019  and august 30 2018  we had fixedrate debt of 53 billion and 31 billion respectively and as a result the fair value of our debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates we estimate that as of august 29 2019  and august 30 2018  a decrease in market interest rates of 1 would increase the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 290 million and 79 million respectively as of august 29 2019  we had no variablerate debt as of august 30 2018  we had variablerate debt of 725 million as of august 30 2018  a 1 increase in the interest rates of our variablerate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 7 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in part i – item 1a risk factors changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the functional currency for all of our operations is the us dollar the substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the us dollar however significant amounts of our debt operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro new taiwan dollar singapore dollar and yen we have established currency risk management programs for our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs which reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 149 million  as of august 29 2019  and 78 million  as of august 30 2018  we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within three  months the effectiveness of our hedges is dependent among other factors upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures we may utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12  months see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – derivative instruments

manufacturing 

we manufacture our products at our worldwide whollyowned and joint venture facilities located in taiwan singapore the united states japan and china and also utilize subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day seven days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is generally replaced every five to seven years with increasingly advanced equipment our dram nand 3d xpoint memory and nor flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage much of our product and process technology and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines 

our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex and involves a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth 3d nonvolatile layers nand cell levels process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps and manufacturing yield other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type cleanliness of our manufacturing environment and utilization of subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes we continuously enhance our production processes increasing bits per wafer and transitioning to higher density products in 2018 we significantly increased our volume production of 1xnm process node dram and expect to achieve bit crossover by the end of the first quarter of 2019 in 2018 we continued to ramp our 64layer 3d nand technology and achieved bit output crossover relative to 32layer in the second half of 2018 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highlycontrolled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and air particle defects success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

 4 

we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie bare die forms our packaged products include memory modules ssds and managed nand including mcps and emmcs we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases outsource assembly services for certain memory modules ssds and mcps 

we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow and perform high temperature burnin on finished products in addition we use our proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing and supply chain operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume products and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 

arrangements with intel 

imft 

since 2006 we have owned 51  of imft a joint venture between us and intel imft is governed by a board of managers for which the number of managers appointed by each member varies based on the members respective ownership interests imft manufactures semiconductor products exclusively for its members under a longterm supply agreement at prices approximating cost in the first quarter of 2018 imft discontinued production of nand and subsequent to that time has been entirely focused on 3d xpoint memory production imft sales to intel were 507 million  438 million  and 457 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

the imft joint venture agreement extends through 2024 and includes certain buysell rights at any time through december 2018 intel can put to us and from january 2019 through december 2021 we can call from intel intels interest in imft in either case for a price that approximates intels interest in the net book value of imft plus member debt at the time of the closing if intel exercises its put right we can elect to set the closing date of the transaction any time between six  months and two  years following such election by intel and we can elect to receive financing of the purchase price from intel for one  to two  years from the closing date if we exercise our call right intel can elect to set the closing date of the transaction to be any time between six  months and one  year following such election following the closing date resulting from exercise of either the put or the call we will continue to supply to intel for a period of one  year between 50  and 100  at intels choice of intels immediately preceding six month period preclosing volumes of imft products for the first six month period following the closing and between 0  and 100  at intels choice of intels first six month period following the closing volumes of imft products for the second six month period following the closing at a margin that varies depending on whether the put or call was exercised 

imfts capital requirements are generally determined based on an annual plan approved by the members and capital contributions to imft are requested as needed capital requests are made to the members in proportion to their thencurrent ownership interest members may elect to not contribute their proportional share and in such event the contributing member may elect to contribute any amount of the capital request either in the form of an equity contribution or member debt financing in 2018 intel provided debt financing of 101 billion  to imft pursuant to the terms of the imft joint venture agreement under the supply agreement the members have rights and obligations to the capacity of imft in proportion to their investment including member debt financing any capital contribution or member debt financing results in a proportionate adjustment to the sharing of output on an eight month lag members pay their proportionate share of fixed costs associated with imfts capacity 

rd arrangements 

we have agreements to jointly develop nand and 3d xpoint technologies with intel we continue to jointly develop nand technologies with intel through the third generation of 3d nand which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019 in the second quarter of 2018 we and intel agreed to independently develop subsequent generations of 3d nand in order to better optimize the technology and products for our respective business needs we continue to jointly develop 3d xpoint technologies with intel through the second generation of 3d xpoint technology which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019 to better optimize 3d xpoint technology for our product roadmap and maximize the benefits for our 

 5 

customers and shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2018 we announced that we will no longer jointly develop with intel subsequent generations of 3d xpoint technology as a result of the above actions we expect reimbursements under our costsharing agreements to decrease in early fiscal 2019 

supply chain materials and use of thirdparty service providers 

our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards and in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as chemicals silicon wafers gases photoresist controllers substrates lead frames printed circuit boards targets and reticle glass blanks shortages or increases in lead times may occur from time to time in the future our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with thirdparty manufacturers of controllers used in a number of our products and with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers contract manufacturers logistic carriers and other service providers certain raw materials are primarily available in certain countries including rare earth minerals available primarily from china and trade disputes or other political or economic conditions may limit our availability to obtain such raw materials we andor our suppliers and service providers could be affected by tariffs embargoes or other trade restrictions as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change conflict minerals and responsible sourcing practices which could limit the supply of our raw materials andor increase the cost in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past the disruption of our supply of raw materials components services or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition we monitor and manage supplychain activities to mitigate risks associated with raw materials and service providers 

marketing and customers 

we continue to transform how we interact with our customers from transactional opportunistic sales of standardized memory components to collaborative relationships where we work with our customers to understand their unique opportunities and challenges we engage with our customers early in the product lifecycle to identify and design features and performance characteristics into our products that our customers need in their end products and then manufacture products that better anticipate and fit their changing needs by collaborating with our customers on their design needs in a changing end market we differentiate our memory and storage solutions which provides greater value to our customers 

our semiconductor memory and storage products are offered under our micron crucial and ballistix brand names and through private labels we market our semiconductor memory and storage products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world we sell our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives distributors and etailers our independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and we make shipments against the orders directly to our customers our distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several months 

in each of the last three years approximately onehalf of our total net sales were to our top ten customers for other information regarding our concentrations and customers see part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – certain concentrations

backlog 

because of volatile industry conditions customers are generally reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our memory and storage products may fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

product warranty 

because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with applicable specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with applicable specifications existing at the time of delivery and will operate to those specifications during a stated warranty period under our standard terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions 

competition 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc toshiba memory corporation and western digital corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments have provided and may continue to provide significant assistance financial or otherwise to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries andor competitors in particular we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the chinese government and various stateowned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance chinas stated national policy objectives in addition the chinese government may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies 

our competitors generally seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some of our competitors have plans to ramp or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand would lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and would adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have cost or performance advantages 

certain of our memory and storage products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors for these products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factors

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors the order of which is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each poses to us which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant any of the factors below could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or stock price 

we have experienced volatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products which may adversely affect our business 

 we have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices including dramatic declines as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such volatility in the future in some prior periods average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future decreases in average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 



we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins 

our gross margins are dependent in part upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs including but not limited to process linewidth additional 3d memory layers additional bits per cell ie cell levels architecture number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and yield in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes difficulties in transitioning to smaller linewidth process technologies 3d memory layers nand cell levels process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps manufacturing yield technological barriers changes in process technologies and new products that may require relatively larger die sizes per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by a broader product portfolio which may have smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles our inability to maintain or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc toshiba memory corporation and western digital corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments have provided and may continue to provide significant assistance financial or otherwise to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries andor competitors in particular we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the chinese government and various stateowned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance chinas stated national policy objectives in addition the chinese government may restrict us from participating in the china market or may prevent us from competing effectively with chinese companies 

our competitors generally seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some 

 12 

of our competitors have plans to ramp or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have cost or performance advantages 

the competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold average selling prices and manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technology support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rd and product and process technology we estimate that net cash expenditures in 2019 for property plant and equipment will be approximately 105 billion plus or minus 5 which reflects the offset of amounts we expect to be funded by our partners investments in capital expenditures net of amounts funded by our partners were 820 billion for 2018 

as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings of mmj initiated in 2012 and for so long as such proceedings are continuing mmj is prohibited from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and such proceedings require that excess earnings be used in mmjs business or to fund the mmj creditor payments in addition pursuant to an order of the tokyo district court mmj cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the tokyo district court and may under certain circumstances be subject to approval of the legal trustee as a result the assets of mmj are not available for use by us in our other operations furthermore certain uses of the assets of mmj including certain capital expenditures of mmj may require consent of mmjs trustees andor the tokyo district court 

in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our debt levels expected debt amortization and general economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory and storage technologies 

our key semiconductor memory and storage products and technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on stacking additional 3d memory layers increasing bits per cell ie cell levels meeting higher density requirements and improving power consumption and reliability we may face technological barriers to continue to shrink our products at our current or historical rate which has generally reduced perunit cost we have invested and expect to continue to invest in rd for new and existing products which involves significant risk and uncertainties we may be unable to recover our investment in rd or otherwise realize the economic benefits of reducing die size or increasing memory and storage densities our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance andor cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies there can be no assurance of the following 

 

we develop and produce advanced memory technologies including 3d xpoint memory a new class of nonvolatile technology there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market new product technologies will be successful unsuccessful efforts to develop new semiconductor memory and storage technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 13 

new product and market development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products including systemlevel memory and storage products and solutions which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technology and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product and systemlevel solution development over the next several years additionally we are increasingly differentiating our products and solutions to meet the specific demands of our customers which increases our reliance on our customers ability to accurately forecast the endcustomers needs and preferences as a result our product demand forecasts may be impacted significantly by the strategic actions of our customers in order to continue our success we must develop manufacture and qualify the products our customers need at the time they need those products the process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance often well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers in addition some of our components have long leadtimes requiring us to place orders several months in advance of anticipated demand such long leadtimes increase the risk of excess inventory or loss of sales in the event our forecasts vary substantially from actual demand there can be no assurance of the following 

 • that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 

our unsuccessful efforts to develop new products and solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks 

we have entered into strategic relationships including our joint development partnership and our imft joint venture with intel to develop new manufacturing process technologies and products and to manufacture certain products these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations including the following 

  

• diverging interests between us and our partners and disagreements on the following 

 • competition from our partners 

• access by our partners to our proprietary product and process technology which they may use 

• difficulties in transferring technology to joint ventures 

• difficulties and delays in ramping production at joint ventures 

• limited control over the operations of our joint ventures 

• inability of our partners to meet their commitments to us or our joint ventures 

 • inadequate cash flows to fund increased capital requirements of our joint ventures 

• difficulties or delays in collecting amounts due to us from our joint ventures and partners 

• disputes with partners regarding the terms of arrangements or that terms of such arrangements are unfavorable and 

• changes in tax legal or regulatory requirements that necessitate changes in the agreements with our partners 

our joint ventures and strategic relationships if unsuccessful could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a significant concentration of our net sales is to a select number of customers 

in each of the last three years approximately onehalf of our total net sales were to our top ten customers a disruption in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our business we could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve in addition any consolidation of our 

 14 

customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products could be sold our inability to meet our customers requirements or to qualify our products with them could adversely impact our sales the loss of one or more of our major customers or any significant reduction in orders from or a shift in product mix by these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

increases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop and qualify our system solutions 

our development of systemlevel memory and storage products is dependent in part upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers specifications for those products developing and manufacturing systemlevel products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products in sufficient volume quantity and in a timely manner if we fail to identify or develop products on a timely basis or at all that comply with our customers specifications or achieve design wins with our customers we may experience a significant adverse impact on our sales and margins even if our products meet customer specifications our sales of systemlevel solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices our competitors products may be less costly provide better performance or include additional features when compared to our products our longterm ability to sell systemlevel memory and storage products is reliant upon our customers ability to create market and sell their products containing our systemlevel solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner if we fail to successfully develop and market systemlevel products our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

even if we are successful in selling systemlevel solutions to our customers in sufficient volume we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our perunit manufacturing costs exceed our perunit selling prices manufacturing systemlevel solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle as compared to discrete products to design test and qualify which may increase our costs additionally some of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications which increases our costs and time to market additionally we may need to update our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications andor industry standards which increases our costs system complexities and extended warranties for systemlevel products could also increase our warranty costs our failure to costeffectively manufacture systemlevel solutions andor firmware in a timely manner may result in reduced demand for our systemlevel products and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

products that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application as a result we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

 

any of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition 

we have incurred in the past and expect to incur in the future debt to finance our capital investments business acquisitions and restructuring of our capital structure as of august 30 2018  we had debt with a carrying value of 464 billion  and may borrow up to an additional 200 billion  under an undrawn revolving credit facility in addition as of august 30 2018  the conversion value in excess of principal of our convertible notes was 185 billion  based on the trading price of our common stock of 5276  per share on such date 

 15 

our debt obligations could adversely impact us for example these obligations could 

 

our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future this to some extent is subject to market economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs additionally events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable drawdown conditions and utilize our revolving credit facility if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property 

we maintain a system of controls over our intellectual property including us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets licensing arrangements confidentiality procedures nondisclosure agreements with employees consultants and vendors and a general system of internal controls despite our system of controls over our intellectual property it may be possible for our current or future competitors to obtain copy use or disclose illegally or otherwise our product and process technology or other proprietary information the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do us laws and our confidentiality nondisclosure and noncompete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce 

additionally our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract develop and retain highly skilled employees global competition for such skilled employees in our industry is intense due to the volatile nature of our industry and our operating results a decline in our operating results andor stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees whose compensation is dependent in part upon the market price of our common stock achieving certain performance metrics levels of company profitability or other financial or companywide performance if our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees they may directly benefit from the knowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment 

our inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 16 

claims that our products or manufacturing processes infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or failure to obtain or renew license agreements covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon misappropriate misuse or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights we are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions made against us any of these types of claims regardless of the merits could subject us to significant costs to defend or resolve such claims and may consume a substantial portion of managements time and attention as a result of these claims we may be required to 

 

we may not be able to take any of the actions described above on commercially reasonable terms and any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – contingencies 

we have a number of intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make onetime or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us the failure to obtain or renew licenses as necessary could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have been served with complaints in chinese courts alleging patent infringement 

we have been served with complaints in chinese courts alleging that we infringe certain chinese patents by manufacturing and selling certain products in china the complaints seek orders requiring us to destroy inventory of the accused products and equipment for manufacturing the accused products in china to stop manufacturing using selling and offering for sale the accused products in china and to pay damages plus court fees 

we are unable to predict the outcome of these assertions of infringement made against us and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our operations in china products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – contingencies 

litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

from time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business or otherwise both domestically and internationally any claim with or without merit could result in significant legal fees that could negatively impact our financial results disrupt our operations and require significant attention from our management we could be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising from our relationships with vendors or customers supply agreements or contractual obligations with our subcontractors or business partners we may also be associated with and subject to litigation arising from the actions of our subcontractors or business partners we may also be subject to litigation as a result of indemnities we issue primarily with our customers the terms of our product warranties and from product liability claims as we continue to focus on developing system solutions with manufacturers of consumer products including autonomous driving augmented reality and others we may be exposed to greater potential for personal liability claims against us as a result of consumers use of those products there can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities and we may elect to selfinsure with respect to certain matters exposures to various litigation could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend claims are required to pay damage awards or enter into settlement agreements any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 17 

if our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we and our subcontractors manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we and our subcontractors maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at manufacturing facilities which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the united states singapore taiwan japan malaysia and china additionally our control over operations at imft is limited by our agreements with intel from time to time there have been disruptions in the manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment disruptions in supply of raw materials or components equipment failures earthquakes or other environmental events if production is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

increases in tariffs or other trade restrictions or taxes on our products or equipment and supplies could have an adverse impact on our operations 

in 2018 88  of our sales were to customers located outside the united states we also purchase a significant portion of equipment and supplies from suppliers outside the united states additionally a significant portion of our facilities are located outside the united states including taiwan singapore japan and china the united states and other countries have levied tariffs and taxes on certain goods general trade tensions between the us and china have been escalating in 2018 with three rounds of us tariffs on chinese goods taking effect in july august and september 2018 each followed by a round of retaliatory chinese tariffs on us goods some of our products are included in these announced tariffs higher duties on existing tariffs and further rounds of tariffs have been announced or threatened by us and chinese leaders if the us were to impose additional tariffs on components that we or our suppliers source from china our cost for such components would increase we may also incur increases in manufacturing costs due to our efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our customers and our operations further changes in trade policy tariffs additional taxes restrictions on exports or other trade barriers or restrictions on supplies equipment and raw materials including rare earth minerals may limit our ability to produce products increase our selling andor manufacturing costs decrease margins reduce the competitiveness of our products or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions 

we must attract retain and motivate highly skilled employees 

to remain competitive we must attract retain and motivate executives and other highly skilled employees hiring and retaining qualified executives engineers technical staff and sales representatives are critical to our business and competition for experienced employees in our industry can be intense our inability to attract and retain key employees may inhibit our ability to expand our business operations additionally changes to immigration policies in the numerous countries in which we operate including the united states may limit our ability to hire andor retain talent in specific locations if our total compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda 

on january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimondas insolvency proceedings filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor bv our netherlands subsidiary micron bv in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron bv and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron bv purchased substantially all of qimondas shares of inotera the inotera shares representing approximately 18 of inoteras outstanding shares as of august 30 2018  and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks among other things to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent crosslicense between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement 

 18 

following a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate on march 13 2014 the court issued judgments 1 ordering micron bv to pay approximately 1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase 2 ordering micron bv to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties 3 ordering micron bv to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares including in particular any profits distributed on the inotera shares and all other benefits 4 denying qimonda’s claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera and 5 determining that qimondas obligations under the patent crosslicense agreement are canceled in addition the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering among other things 1 that micron bv transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by micron bv and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties and 2 that micron bv pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by micron bv from ownership of the inotera shares the interlocutory judgments have no immediate enforceable effect on us and accordingly we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case we have filed a notice of appeal and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court 

we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron bv from the ownership of the inotera shares andor the termination of the patent crosslicense which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

breaches of our security systems could expose us to losses 

we maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities we also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations in addition we process store and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees including sensitive personal information unauthorized persons or employees may gain access to our facilities or network systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information compromise confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities breaches of our physical security and attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers suppliers or employees is compromised which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

across our global operations significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the euro singapore dollar new taiwan dollar and yen although we hedge our primary exposures to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies exchange rates for some of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the yen have been volatile in recent periods if these currencies strengthen against the us dollar our manufacturing costs could significantly increase exchange rates for the us dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may make future acquisitions andor alliances which involve numerous risks 

acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 



 19 

 

in previous years supply of memory and storage products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices the global memory and storage industry has experienced consolidation and may continue to consolidate we engage from time to time in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our business results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected by the limited availability and quality of materials supplies and capital equipment or the dependency on thirdparty service providers 

our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards and in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as chemicals silicon wafers gases photoresist controllers substrates lead frames printed circuit boards targets and reticle glass blanks shortages or increases in lead times may occur from time to time in the future our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with thirdparty manufacturers of controllers used in a number of our products and with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers contract manufacturers logistic carriers and other service providers certain raw materials are primarily available in certain countries including rare earth minerals available primarily from china and trade disputes or other political or economic conditions may limit our availability to obtain such raw materials we andor our suppliers and service providers could be affected by tariffs embargoes or other trade restrictions as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change conflict minerals and responsible sourcing practices which could limit the supply of our raw materials andor increase the cost in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past the disruption of our supply of raw materials components services or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers limited capacity our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and could increase our overall costs of a ramp our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business 

downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers mobile devices ssds and servers reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result a downturn in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 20 

our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate 

we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations or result in construction delays in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster fire explosion or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our incentives from various governments are conditional upon achieving or maintaining certain performance obligations and are subject to reduction termination or clawback 

we have received and may in the future continue to receive benefits and incentives from national state and local governments in various regions of the world designed to encourage us to establish maintain or increase investment workforce or production in those regions these incentives may take various forms including grants loan subsidies and tax arrangements and typically require us to perform or maintain certain levels of investment capital spending employment technology deployment or research and development activities to qualify for such incentives we cannot guarantee that we will successfully achieve performance obligations required to qualify for these incentives or that the granting agencies will provide such funding these incentive arrangements typically provide the granting agencies with rights to audit our performance with the terms and obligations such audits could result in modifications to or termination of the applicable incentive program the incentives we receive could be subject to reduction termination or clawback and any decrease or clawback of government incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a change in tax laws in key jurisdictions could materially increase our tax expense 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and many foreign jurisdictions changes to income tax laws and regulations in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate or in the interpretation of such laws could significantly increase our effective tax rate and ultimately reduce our cash flow from operating activities and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition for example as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act enacted on december 22 2017 by the united states our effective tax rate may increase to the low teens percentage in 2019 depending on the amount and geographic mix of our taxable income additionally various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic cooperation and development which represents a coalition of member countries and recommended changes to numerous longstanding tax principles if adopted by countries such changes as well as changes in us federal and state tax laws or in taxing jurisdictions administrative interpretations decisions policies and positions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

we operate in a number of locations outside the united states including singapore where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the geographic mix of our earnings among these jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing agreements failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements and changes in tax laws and regulations additionally we file income tax returns with the us federal government various us states and various other jurisdictions throughout the world and certain tax returns may remain open to examination for several years the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur additional restructuring charges in future periods 

from time to time we have and may in the future enter into restructure initiatives in order to among other items streamline our operations respond to changes in business conditions our markets or product offerings or to centralize certain key functions we may not realize expected savings or other benefits from our restructure activities and may incur additional restructure charges or other losses in future periods associated with other initiatives in connection with any restructure initiatives we could incur restructure charges loss of production output loss of key personnel disruptions in our operations 

 21 

and difficulties in the timely delivery of products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

a substantial majority of our consolidated net sales are to customers outside the united states in addition a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states in particular a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore taiwan japan and china our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

many of our customers suppliers and vendors operate internationally and are also subject to the foregoing risks if we or our customers suppliers or vendors are impacted by these risks it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

compliance with customer requirements and regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act and its implementing sec regulations the doddfrank act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo the drc and finance or benefit local armed groups these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors the implementation of these regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict free in addition many of our customers have or are planning to adopt responsible sourcing programs with requirements that our broader in terms of minerals and geographies than drc conflict minerals programs our inability to comply with requirements regarding the use of conflict and other minerals could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

 22 

we and others are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that may result in additional costs and liabilities 

the manufacturing of our products requires the use of facilities equipment and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate additionally we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction maintenance and operations of our facilities any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results additionally we engage various third parties to represent us or otherwise act on our behalf and we partner with other companies in our joint ventures all of whom are also subject to a broad array of laws and regulations our engagement with these third parties and our ownership in these joint ventures may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with these laws and regulations as a result of these items we could experience the following 

 

our failure or the failure of our thirdparty agents or joint ventures to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to counterparty default risks 

we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash deposits investments capped call contracts on our common stock and derivative instruments as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings in the event of such default we could incur significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the operations of mmj are subject to continued oversight by the tokyo district court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings

see part ii – financial information – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – contingencies and item 1a risk factors for a discussion of other legal proceedings 

reorganization proceedings of the mmj companies 

in 2013 we completed the acquisition of elpida memory inc now known as mmj a japanese corporation pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement on support for reorganization companies as amended the sponsor agreement that we entered into in 2012 with the trustees of the mmj companies pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan under the sponsor agreement we agreed to provide certain support for the reorganization of the mmj companies and the trustees agreed to prepare and seek approval from the tokyo district court and the mmj companies creditors of plan of reorganization consistent with such support 

the plan of reorganization provides for payments by the mmj companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items the plan of reorganization also provided for the investment by us pursuant to the sponsor agreement of 60 billion yen paid at closing in cash into mmj in exchange for 100 ownership of mmjs equity and the use of such investment to fund the initial installment payment by the mmj companies to their creditors of 60 billion yen subject to reduction for certain items specified in the sponsor agreement and plan of reorganization 

 24 

under mmjs plan of reorganization secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their fixed claims and unsecured creditors will recover at least 174 of the amount of their fixed claims the actual recovery of unsecured creditors will be higher however based in part on events and circumstances occurring following the plan approval the remaining portion of the unsecured claims will be discharged without payment over the period that payments are made pursuant to the plan of reorganization the secured creditors will be paid in full on or before the sixth installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments the unsecured creditors of mai were scheduled to be paid in seven  installments however in connection with our sale of mai in 2017 the remaining mai creditor obligation was paid in full and mais reorganization proceedings were closed 

because mmjs plan of reorganization provides for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of the mmj acquisition the reorganization proceedings in japan are continuing and mmj remains subject to the oversight of the tokyo district court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the tokyo district court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the reorganization proceedings the business trustee is responsible for overseeing the operation of the businesses of the mmj companies other than oversight in relation to acts that need to be carried out in connection with the japan proceedings which are the responsibility of the legal trustee mmjs reorganization proceedings in japan and oversight of the tokyo district court will continue until the final creditor payment is made under mmjs plan of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date mmj may petition the tokyo district court for an early termination of the reorganization proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plan of reorganization are made although such early terminations are customarily granted there can be no assurance that the tokyo district court will grant any such petition in this particular case 

during the pendency of the reorganization proceedings in japan mmj is obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the tokyo district court and may be required to obtain the consent of the tokyo district court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to its businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling material disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of mmj or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of mmjs plan of reorganization accordingly during the pendency of the reorganization proceedings in japan our ability to effectively integrate mmj as part of our global operations or to cause mmj to take certain actions that we deem advisable for its businesses could be adversely affected if the tokyo district court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to mmj

results of operations 

consolidated results 



total net sales 

total net sales for 2018 increased 50 as compared to 2017 higher sales in 2018 for both dram and nand products as compared to 2017 were driven by strong execution in delivering highvalue products featuring our 1xnm dram and 64layer 3d nand technologies combined with strong demand for products across our primary markets sales of dram products for 2018 increased 64 from 2017 primarily due to an increase in average selling prices of approximately 35 and an increase in sales volumes of approximately 20 as a result of strong market conditions particularly for cloud enterprise mobile and graphics markets combined with increased sales into highvalue markets sales of trade nand products for 2018 increased 26 from 2017 despite declines in average selling prices primarily due to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 40 driven by increases in sales of highvalue ssd and mobile managed nand products enabled by strong demand and our execution in delivering 3d nand products 

total net sales for 2017 increased 64 as compared to 2016 due to strong conditions across our primary markets particularly for enterprise mobile client and ssd storage sales of dram products for 2017 increased 80 from 2016 due to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 50 and an increase in average selling prices of approximately 20 as a result of the strong market conditions sales of trade nand products for 2017 increased approximately 50 as compared to 2016 due to an increase in sales volumes of approximately 65 resulting from strong market demand for our 3d nand products which was partially offset by declines in average selling prices increases in dram and nand sales volumes for 2017 as compared 2016 were enabled by higher manufacturing output due to improvements in product and process technology and solid execution increases in sales volumes for nand products for 2017 were also enabled by key customer qualifications of new products 

overall gross margin 

our overall gross margin percentage increased to 59 for 2018 from 42 for 2017 primarily due to favorable market conditions across key markets combined with strong execution in delivering products featuring advanced technologies including 1xnm dram and 64layer 3d nand enabling manufacturing cost reductions for 2018 as compared to 2017 pricing for dram products increased while manufacturing costs declined and for nand products manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices 

our overall gross margin percentage increased to 42 for 2017 from 20 for 2016 primarily due to strong markets that drove favorable pricing conditions and solid execution in manufacturing cost reductions from improvements in product and process technology for 2017 as compared to 2016 pricing for dram products increased while manufacturing costs declined 

 29 

and for nand products manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in selling prices we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment in the fourth quarter of 2016 we identified factors such as the lengthening period of time between dram product technology node transitions an increased reuse rate of equipment and industry trends as a result we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five  to seven  years in the fourth quarter of 2016 the effect of the revision was not material for 2016 and reduced depreciation expense at the time by approximately 100 million  per quarter 

from january 2013 through december 2015 we purchased all of inoteras dram output under supply agreements at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components after december 2015 through december 6 2016 the date we acquired the remaining interest in inotera the price for dram products we purchased from inotera was based on a formula that equally shared margin between inotera and us under these agreements we purchased 504 million  and 143 billion  of dram products from inotera in 2017 and 2016 respectively which represented 9 of our aggregate dram gigabit production for 2017 and 30 for 2016 

net sales by business unit 



percentages are of total net sales but may not total 100 due to rounding 

cnbu sales for 2018 increased 77 as compared to 2017 due to strong market conditions and demand in key markets including cloud server client enterprise server markets and graphics markets which drove increases in pricing and sales volumes sales into cloud and graphics markets more than doubled in 2018 as compared to 2017 mbu sales for 2018 which were comprised primarily of mobile lpdram and managed nand products increased 49 as compared to 2017 primarily due to customer qualifications for lpdram and managed nand products which combined with higher memory content in smartphones to drive improvements in dram pricing and increases in sales volumes sbu sales of trade nand products for 2018 increased 13 as compared to 2017 driven by higher sales of ssd storage products which increased by 72 partially offset by declines in sbu nand component sales from a strategic reallocation of supply from component sales to ssd and mobile managed nand products increases in sbu sales volumes for 2018 resulting from strong demand for cloud and enterprise ssd markets more than offset declines in selling prices sbu sales also include nontrade products consisting of products manufactured and sold to intel through imft under a longterm supply agreement at prices approximating cost which included 3d xpoint memory and nand products aggregating 541 million 553 million  and 501 million  for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively ebu sales for 2018 increased 29 as compared to 2017 primarily due to strong demand across ebus primary markets including consumer industrial multimarkets and automotive ebu sales were comprised of products incorporating dram nand and nor flash in decreasing order of revenue 

cnbu sales for 2017 increased 90 as compared to 2016 due to increases in average selling prices due to strong demand across key markets growth in the cloud market driven by significant increases in dram content per server and increases in sales of our gddr5 and gddr5x products into the graphics market driven by strong demand from the gaming industry mbu sales for 2017 increased 72 as compared to 2016 primarily due to significant increases in sales volumes driven by customer qualifications for lpdram and managed nand products combined with higher memory content in smartphones and growth in sales of emcp products mbu sales growth in 2017 was partially offset by declines in average selling prices for trade nand products sbu sales of trade nand products for 2017 increased 41 as compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in sales volumes from strong demand particularly for component nand and client and cloud ssd storage products partially offset by declines in average selling prices sbu sales of ssd storage products increased by 137 for 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily as a result of the launch of new ssd products incorporating our tlc 3d nand technology ebu sales for 2017 increased 39 as compared to 2016 primarily due to strong demand and higher sales volumes for dram and emcp in consumer markets and dram and emmc products in the automotive markets

operating income loss by business unit 



percentages reflect operating income loss as a percentage of net sales for each business unit 

cnbu operating income for 2018 improved from 2017 primarily due to improved pricing and higher sales volumes resulting from strong demand for our products combined with manufacturing cost reductions mbu operating income for 2018 improved from 2017 primarily due to increases in pricing and sales volumes for lpdram products higher sales of highvalue managed nand products and manufacturing cost reductions sbu operating income for 2018 improved from 2017 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions enabled by our execution in transitioning to 64layer tlc 3d nand products and improvements in product mix sbu operating income for 2018 was adversely impacted by higher costs associated with imfts production of 3d xpoint memory products at less than full capacity ebu operating income for 2018 increased as compared to 2017 as a result of increases in average selling prices manufacturing cost reductions and increases in sales volumes partially offset by higher rd costs 

cnbu operating margin for 2017 improved from 2016 primarily due to improved pricing from strong market conditions manufacturing cost reductions and product mix mbu operating income for 2017 improved from 2016 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions and higher sales volumes partially offset by higher rd costs and declines in average selling prices for trade nand products sbu operating margin for 2017 improved from 2016 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions partially offset by declines in average selling prices ebu operating income for 2017 increased as compared to 2016 as a result of manufacturing cost reductions which outpaced declines in average selling prices and increases in sales volumes 

operating expenses and other 

selling general and administrative 

sga expenses for 2018 were 9 higher than 2017 primarily due to increases in legal costs technical and consulting fees and employee compensation sga expenses for 2017 were 13 higher than 2016 primarily due to increases in employee compensation as well as transaction costs related to the inotera acquisition 

research and development 

rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 

rd expenses for 2018 were 17 higher than 2017 primarily due to increases in employee compensation volumes of development and prequalification wafers and depreciation expense as a result of increases in capital spending rd expenses for 2017 were 13 higher than 2016 primarily due to higher volumes of development and prequalification wafers and increases in employee compensation partially offset by lower engineering and other professional services costs 

we share the cost of certain product and process development activities under development agreements with partners including agreements to jointly develop nand and 3d xpoint technologies with intel we continue to jointly develop nand technologies with intel through the third generation of 3d nand which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019 in the second quarter of 2018 we and intel agreed to independently develop subsequent generations of 3d nand in order to better optimize the technology and products for our respective business needs we continue to jointly develop 3d xpoint technologies with intel through the second generation of 3d xpoint technology which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019 to better optimize 3d xpoint technology for our product roadmap and maximize the benefits for our customers and shareholders in the fourth quarter of 2018 we announced that we will no longer jointly develop with intel 

 31 

subsequent generations of 3d xpoint technology as a result of the above actions we expect reimbursements under our costsharing agreements to decrease in early fiscal 2019 our rd expenses were reduced by reimbursements under these development partner arrangements by 201 million  213 million  and 205 million  for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act which lowered the us corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 and significantly affects how income from foreign operations is taxed in the united states our us statutory federal rate was 257 for 2018 based on the 35 corporate rate through december 31 2017 and 21 from that date through the end of fiscal year 2018 and will be 21 beginning in 2019 the tax act imposed a onetime transition tax in 2018 on accumulated foreign income the repatriation tax provided a us federal tax exemption on foreign earnings distributed to the united states after january 1 2018 and beginning in 2019 created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets the foreign minimum tax the tax act allows us to elect to pay any repatriation tax due in eight annual interestfree payments in increasing amounts beginning in december 2018 in connection with the provisions of the tax act we made an accounting policy election to treat the foreign minimum tax provision as a period cost in the period the tax is incurred 

sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 allows the use of provisional amounts reasonable estimates if our analyses of the impacts of the tax act have not been completed when our financial statements are issued the provisional amounts below for 2018 represent reasonable estimates of the effects of the tax act for which our analysis is not yet complete as we complete our analysis of the tax act including collecting preparing and analyzing necessary information performing and refining calculations and obtaining additional guidance from the irs us treasury department fasb or other standard setting and regulatory bodies on the tax act we may record adjustments to the provisional amounts which may be material in accordance with sab 118 our accounting for the tax effects of the tax act will be completed during the measurement period which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date at august 30 2018 there were no provisions for which we were unable to record a reasonable estimate of the impact 

our income tax provision benefit consisted of the following 



our income taxes reflect various impacts of the tax act including the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the lower us corporate rate of 257 for 2018 and 21 for subsequent years and provisional estimates for the repatriation tax and the release of a substantial portion of the valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of our us operations our income tax rates also include operations outside the united states including singapore where we have tax incentive arrangements that further decrease our effective tax rates beginning in 2019 our effective tax rate may increase to the low teens percentage depending on the amount and geographic mix of taxable income income taxes for 2018 2017 and 2016 included tax benefits of 1 million 28 million and 58 million respectively related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters which were previously reserved as uncertain tax positions 

during 2018 we reassessed our capital structure including our board of directors authorization to repurchase up to 10 billion of our outstanding common stock beginning in 2019 the future cash needs of our global operations and the effects of the tax act as a result of this reassessment we deemed a portion of our foreign earnings to be no longer indefinitely reinvested as a result of the repatriation tax substantially all of our accumulated foreign earnings prior to december 31 2017 

 32 

were subject to us federal taxation although these earnings have been subject to us federal income tax under the repatriation tax the repatriation to the united states of all or a portion of these earnings would potentially be subject to foreign withholding and state income tax as of august 30 2018 we had a deferred tax liability of 82 million associated with our undistributed earnings 

we operate in a number of tax jurisdictions outside the unites states including singapore where we have tax incentive arrangements which expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2031 that are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds the effect of tax incentive arrangements reduced our tax provision by 196 billion  benefiting our diluted earnings per share by 159  for 2018  by 742 million   064  per diluted share for 2017  and were not material in 2016  

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – income taxes 

other 

net interest expense decreased 60 for 2018 as compared to 2017 due to decreases in debt obligations and increases in interest income net interest expense increased 42 for 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in debt obligations including our borrowings of 80 billion new taiwan dollars in december 2016 in connection with our acquisition of inotera and 125 billion from the issuance of our 2023 secured notes in april 2016 

further discussion of other operating and nonoperating income and expenses can be found in the following notes contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products which can vary significantly from period to period we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations we expect from time to time to engage in a variety of financing transactions for such purposes including the issuance of securities we have an undrawn revolving credit facility that expires in july 2023 and provides for borrowings of up to 200 billion  we expect that our cash and investments cash flows from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months 

to develop new product and process technology support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and equipment and rd we estimate that capital expenditures in 2019 for property plant and equipment net of partner contributions to be 105 billion plus or minus 5 focused on technology transitions and product enablement the actual amounts for 2019 will vary depending on market conditions as of august 30 2018  we had commitments of approximately 18 billion  for the acquisition of property plant and equipment substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year 

in may 2018 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to 10 billion  of our outstanding common stock beginning in 2019 we may purchase shares on a discretionary basis through openmarket purchases block trades privatelynegotiated transactions derivative transactions andor pursuant to a rule 10b51 trading plan subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash the repurchase authorization does not obligate us to acquire any common stock 

from august 31 2018 through october 12 2018 we repurchased an aggregate of 165 billion of our common stock under an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement a rule 10b51plan and through open market repurchases pursuant to the asr we entered into an agreement with a financial institution to purchase 100 billion  of our common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 the number of shares ultimately purchased will be calculated by dividing 100 billion  by a volumeweighted average price of our common stock from september 5 2018 through as late as november 29 2018 the 

 33 

measurement period subject to an agreedupon discount on september 5 2018 we paid 100 billion  to the financial institution and received an initial installment of 14 million  shares with the final share amount to be determined as of the end of the measurement period

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

business acquisitions  accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized in subsequent periods accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred we typically obtain independent third party 

 36 

valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows discount rates and comparable market values items involving significant assumptions estimates and judgments include the following 

 

consolidation  we have interests in entities that are vies determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing whether an entity is a vie and if we are the entitys primary beneficiary if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we are required to consolidate it to determine if we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies require significant assumptions and judgments 

contingencies  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss if any from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date in accounting for the resolution of contingencies significant judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods 

goodwill and intangible assets   we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform the goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the reporting unit for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value goodwill is tested for impairment by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then we would record an impairment loss up to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value 

determining when to test for impairment the reporting units the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates forecasted manufacturing costs and other expenses and are developed as part of our longrange planning process the same estimates are used in business planning forecasting and capital budgeting as part of our longterm manufacturing capacity analysis we test the reasonableness of the output of our longrange planning process by calculating an implied value per share and comparing that to current stock prices analysts consensus pricing and managements expectations these estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit which are discounted using a riskadjusted rate to estimate a fair value the discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

we test other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows estimating fair values involves significant assumptions including future sales prices sales volumes costs and discount rates 

 37 

income taxes   we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of the applicable fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in recent periods our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and the united states our income tax provision or benefit is dependent in part on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve significant judgments including among others projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes manufacturing and overhead costs levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value cost includes depreciation labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining net realizable value of inventories involves significant judgments including projecting future average selling prices sales volumes and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated net realizable values below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when inventories are actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our inventory by approximately 577 million as of august 30 2018 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory and storage markets actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories we review the major characteristics of product type and markets in determining the unit of account for which we perform the lower of average cost or net realizable value analysis and categorize inventories primarily as memory including dram nand and other memory 

property plant and equipment  we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimate of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require significant judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition significant judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016 the effect of the revision was not material for 2016 and reduced depreciation expense at the time by approximately 100 million  per quarter see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – significant accounting policies 

research and development  costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires significant judgment by us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are included in cost of goods sold 

stockbased compensation   stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on our assessment of the likelihood of the performance measure being 

 38 

achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires significant judgment 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires significant judgment including estimating stock price volatility and expected option life we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock options and awards granted under our employee stock purchase plan espp we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio as of august 30 2018  and august 31 2017  we had fixedrate debt of 31 billion and 57 billion respectively and as a result the fair value of our debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates we estimate that as of august 30 2018  and august 31 2017  a decrease in market interest rates of 1 would increase the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 79 million and 273 million respectively as of august 30 2018  and august 31 2017  we had variablerate debt of 725 million and 42 billion respectively as of august 30 2018  and august 31 2017  a 1 increase in the interest rates of our variablerate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately 7 million and 43 million respectively 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in part i – item 1a risk factors changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the functional currency for all of our operations is the us dollar the substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the us dollar however significant amounts of our debt operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro new taiwan dollar singapore dollar and yen we have established currency risk management programs for our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs which reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 78 million  as of august 30 2018  and 391 million  as of august 31 2017  we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within nine  months the effectiveness of our hedges is dependent among other factors upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures we may utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12  months see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – derivative instruments

imft 

since 2006 we have owned 51  of imft a joint venture between us and intel to manufacture memory products exclusively for its members who share the output of imft in proportion to their investment under a longterm supply agreement at prices approximating cost in 2017 imft began to transition its manufacturing from nand to 3d xpoint memory products we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand and 3d xpoint memory at imft and our other facilities imft is governed by a board of managers for which the number of managers appointed by each member varies based on the members respective ownership interests the imft joint venture agreement extends through 2024 and includes certain buysell rights through december 2018 intel can put to us and from january 2019 through december 2021 we can call from intel intels interest in imft in either case for an amount equal to the noncontrolling interest balance attributable to intel at such time either member exercises its right if intel exercises its put right we can elect to set the closing date of the transaction to be any time within two years following such election by intel and can elect to receive financing of the purchase price from intel for one to two years from the closing date see part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – equity – noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries – imft 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china japan malaysia singapore and taiwan nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is generally replaced every five to seven years with increasingly advanced equipment our dram nand 3d xpoint memory and nor flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage our product and process technology and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines 

our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth 3d nonvolatile layers nand cell levels process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps and manufacturing yield other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of our manufacturing environment we continuously enhance our production processes increasing bits per wafer and transitioning to higher density products in 2017 we significantly increased our volume production of 1xnm process node dram and beginning in the first quarter of 2017 manufactured a majority of our nand production using our first generation 32layer 3d nand technology in 2017 we began ramping production of our second generation 64layer 3d nand technology and tlc products became the majority of our 3d nand output 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highlycontrolled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and air particle defects success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie bare die forms our packaged products include memory modules ssds mcps managed nand and hmcs we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment we subcontract assembly services for the production of certain memory modules ssds and mcps 

we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow and perform high temperature burnin on finished products in addition we use our proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost we use subcontractors to perform certain testing services 

 4 

in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 

availability of raw materials and use of service providers 

our operations require raw materials and in some cases thirdparty services that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as chemicals silicon wafers gases photoresist controllers substrates lead frames printed circuit boards targets and reticle glass blanks shortages may occur from time to time in the future we andor our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past the disruption of our supply of raw materials or services or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business result of operations or financial condition 

our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers contract manufacturers logistic carriers and other service providers we have supply chain risk monitoring and management to mitigate our risks associated with raw materials and service providers 

marketing and customers 

for 2017  20  of our net sales were to the compute and graphics market including desktop pcs notebooks and workstations 20  were to mobile 20  were to ssd and other storage 15  were to automotive industrial medical and other embedded and 15  were to server sales to kingston technology corporation consisted primarily of dram and as a percentage of total net sales were 10  7 and 11  for 2017  2016 and 2015  respectively sales to intel including nontrade sales through imft as a percentage of total net sales were 9 14  and 8 for 2017 2016  and 2015 respectively no other customer exceeded 10 of our total net sales for 2017 2016 or 2015 

our semiconductor memory and storage products are offered under our micron crucial and ballistix brand names and private labels we market our semiconductor memory and storage products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world we sell our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors who obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis we then make shipments against these orders directly to our customers distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several months 

backlog 

because of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

product warranty 

because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with applicable specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end 

 5 

uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with applicable specifications existing at the time of delivery and will operate to those specifications during a stated warranty period under our standard terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions 

competition 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc toshiba corporation and western digital corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments such as china have provided and may continue to provide significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants our competitors generally seek to increase silicon capacity and bits per wafer which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage products also result from capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production our competitors may increase capital expenditures or increase capacity at existing or new facilities resulting in future increases in worldwide supply increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand would lead to declines in average selling prices for our products and materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition many of our highvolume memory and storage products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors for these highvolume products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factors for our other products the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence over pricing 

research and development 

our process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of process technology that enables continuous improvement to cost structures and performance enhancements for our future dram and nand products we are also focused on developing new fundamentally different memory structures materials and packages which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation products additional process technology rd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing storage and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr4 and ddr5 dram and lpdram products as well as high density and mobile 3d nand including tlc and qlc technologies 3d xpoint memory ssds including firmware and controllers managed nand specialty memory and other memory technologies and systems 

our rd expenses were 182 billion  162 billion  and 154 billion  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand and 3d xpoint memory our rd expenses reflect net reductions of 213 million  205 million  and 224 million  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively as a result of reimbursements under our costsharing arrangements with intel 

to compete in the semiconductor memory and storage markets we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory and storage products and solutions our process design and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world with our largest rd center located in boise idaho and other significant rd centers in japan china italy singapore and other sites in the united states in 2017 we began ramping operations in an expansion of our rd facility in boise 

rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing development of a 

 6 

product is deemed complete when it is qualified through thorough reviews and tests for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 

geographic information 

sales to customers outside the united states totaled 1756 billion  for 2017  and included sales of 1039 billion  in china 254 billion  in taiwan 136 billion  in europe 103 billion  in japan and 181 billion  in the rest of the asia pacific region sales to customers outside the united states totaled 1047 billion  for 2016  and 1363 billion  for 2015  as of august 31 2017  we had net property plant and equipment of 652 billion  in taiwan 526 billion  in singapore 425 billion  in the united states 283 billion  in japan 453 million  in china and 118 million  in other countries see part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – geographic information and item 1a risk factors 

patents and licenses 

in recent years we have been recognized as a leader in per capita and quality of patents issued as of august 31 2017  we owned approximately 15500 us patents and 5000 foreign patents in addition we have thousands of us and foreign patent applications pending our patents have various terms expiring through 2037 

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have from time to time licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties some of these license agreements require us to make onetime or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us 

employees 

as of august 31 2017  we had approximately 34100 employees 

environmental compliance 

we approach environmental stewardship and sustainability proactively to ensure we meet all government regulations regarding raw materials discharges emissions and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of the international organization for standardization iso 14001 environmental management systems standard to ensure we are continuously improving our performance as part of the iso 14001 framework we must meet annual requirements in environmental policy compliance planning management structure and responsibility training communication document control operational control emergency preparedness and response record keeping and management review while we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures modification of our operations or other compliance actions

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors the order of which is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each poses to us which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant any of the factors below could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition or stock price 

we have experienced volatility in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory and storage products which may adversely affect our business 

 we have experienced significant volatility in our average selling prices including dramatic declines as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such volatility in the future in some prior periods average selling prices for our products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future decreases in average selling prices for our products that decline faster than our costs could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 



we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins 

our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs including but not limited to process linewidth additional 3d memory layers additional bits per cell ie cell levels architecture number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and yield in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes difficulties in transitioning to smaller linewidth process technologies 3d memory layers nand cell levels process complexity including number of mask layers and fabrication steps manufacturing yield technological barriers changes in process technologies and new products that may require relatively larger die sizes per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by a broader product portfolio which may have smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles our inability to maintain or improve gross margins could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the semiconductor memory and storage markets are highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc toshiba corporation and western digital corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments such as china have provided and may continue to provide significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants our competitors generally seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some of our competitors have plans to ramp or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have 

 11 

cost or performance advantages the competitive nature of our industry could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition 

in recent periods our debt levels have increased due to the capital intensive nature of our business business acquisitions and the restructuring of our capital structure as of august 31 2017  we had debt with a carrying value of 1113 billion  in addition the conversion value in excess of principal of our convertible notes as of august 31 2017  was 191 billion  based on the trading price of our common stock of 3197  as of august 31 2017  in 2017  2016  and 2015  we paid  163 billion  94 million  and 143 billion respectively to repurchase and settle notes with principal amounts of  155 billion   57 million  and 489 million respectively as of august 31 2017  we had a revolving credit facility that provided for additional borrowings of up to 750 million  based on eligible receivables events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable drawdown conditions and utilize this revolving credit facility we have incurred in the past and expect to incur in the future debt to finance our capital investments business acquisitions and restructuring of our capital structure 

our debt obligations could adversely impact us for example these obligations could 

 

our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future this to some extent is subject to market economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt payment obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and storage products sold average selling prices and manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technology support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rd and product and process technology we estimate that net cash expenditures in 2018 for property plant and equipment will be approximately 75 billion plus or minus 5 percent which reflects the offset of amounts we expect to be funded by our partners investments in capital expenditures offset by amounts funded by our partners were 513 billion for 2017 as of august 31 2017  we had cash and marketable investments of 605 billion  as of august 31 

 12 

2017  129 billion of cash and marketable investments including substantially all of the cash held by the mmj group mstw and mttw was held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the united states would subject these funds to us federal income taxes in addition cash of 87 million  held by imft was generally not available to finance our other operations 

the 2021 mstw term loan contains covenants that limit or restrict mstws ability to create liens in or dispose of collateral securing obligations under the 2021 mstw term loan mergers involving mstw andor mttw loans or guarantees to third parties by mttw andor mstw and mstws andor mttws distribution of cash dividends as a result the assets of mstw andor mttw are not available for use by us in our other operations 

as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings of mmj initiated in 2012 and for so long as such proceedings are continuing mmj is prohibited from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and such proceedings require that excess earnings be used in mmjs business or to fund the mmj creditor payments in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court mmj cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court and may under certain circumstances be subject to approval of the legal trustee as a result the assets of mmj are not available for use by us in our other operations furthermore certain uses of the assets of mmj including certain capital expenditures of mmj and mmt or further investments in mmt may require consent of mmjs trustees andor the japan court 

in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our debt levels expected debt amortization and general economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory and storage technologies 

our key semiconductor memory and storage products and technologies face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on stacking additional 3d memory layers additional bits per cell ie cell levels the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability to meet these requirements we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory and storage industry our competitors are working to develop new memory and storage technologies that may offer performance and cost advantages to existing technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory and storage technologies there can be no assurance of the following 

 

we develop and produce 3d xpoint memory which is a new class of nonvolatile technology there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market this new product technology will be successful our unsuccessful efforts to develop new semiconductor memory and storage technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

new product development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products including systemlevel memory and storage products and solutions which complement our traditional products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technology and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop new products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance often well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance of the following 

• that our product development efforts will be successful 

• that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products 

• that we will be able to successfully market these products 

 13 

• that we will be able to qualify new products with our customers on a timely basis or 

• that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 

our unsuccessful efforts to develop new products and solutions could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks 

we have entered into strategic relationships including our imft joint venture with intel to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the following 

 

our joint ventures and strategic relationships if unsuccessful could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a significant concentration of our net sales are to a select number of customers 

in each of the last three years approximately onehalf of our total net sales were to our top ten customers a disruption in our relationship with any of these customers could adversely affect our business we could experience fluctuations in our customer base or the mix of revenue by customer as markets and strategies evolve in addition any consolidation of our customers could reduce the number of customers to whom our products could be sold our inability to meet our customers requirements or to qualify our products with them could adversely impact our sales the loss of one or more of our major customers or any significant reduction in orders from or a shift in product mix by these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

increases in sales of system solutions may increase our dependency upon specific customers and our costs to develop and qualify our system solutions 

our development of systemlevel memory and storage products is dependent in part upon successfully identifying and meeting our customers specifications of those products developing and manufacturing systemlevel products with specifications unique to a customer increases our reliance upon that customer for purchasing our products in sufficient volume quantity and in a timely manner if we fail to identify or develop products on a timely basis or at all that comply with our customers specifications or achieve design wins with our customers we may experience a significant adverse impact on our sales and margins even if our products meet customer specifications our sales of systemlevel solutions are dependent upon our customers choosing our products over those of our competitors and purchasing our products at sufficient volumes and prices our competitors products may be less costly provide better performance or include additional features when compared to our products our longterm ability to sell systemlevel memory and storage products is reliant upon our customers ability to create market and sell their products containing our systemlevel solutions at sufficient volumes and prices in a timely manner if we fail to successfully develop and market systemlevel products our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

 14 

even if we are successful in selling systemlevel solutions to our customers in sufficient volume we may be unable to generate sufficient profit if our perunit manufacturing costs exceed our perunit selling prices manufacturing systemlevel solutions to customer specifications requires a longer development cycle as compared to discreet products to design test and qualify which may increase our costs additionally some of our system solutions are increasingly dependent on sophisticated firmware that may require significant customization to meet customer specifications which increases our costs and time to market additionally we may update our firmware or develop new firmware as a result of new product introductions or changes in customer specifications andor industry standards which increases our costs system complexities and extended warranties for systemlevel products could also increase our warranty costs our failure to costeffectively manufacture systemlevel solutions andor firmware in a timely manner may result in reduced demand for our systemlevel products and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

products that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application as a result we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

 

any of the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property 

we maintain a system of controls over our intellectual property including us and foreign patents trademarks copyrights trade secret laws licensing arrangements confidentiality procedures nondisclosure agreements with employees consultants and vendors and a general system of internal controls despite our system of controls over our intellectual property it may be possible for our current or future competitors to obtain copy use or disclose illegally or otherwise our product and process technology the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same degree as do us laws and our confidentiality nondisclosure and noncompete agreements may be unenforceable or difficult and costly to enforce 

additionally our ability to maintain and develop intellectual property is dependent upon our ability to attract develop and retain highly skilled employees global competition for such skilled employees in our industry is intense due to the volatile nature of our industry and our operating results a decline in our operating results andor stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees whose compensation is dependent in part upon the market price of our common stock achieving certain performance metrics levels of company profitability or other financial or companywide performance if our competitors or future entrants into our industry are successful in hiring our employees they may directly benefit from the knowledge these employees gained while they were under our employment 

our inability to protect our intellectual property or retain key employees who are knowledgeable of and develop our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe upon their intellectual property rights we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a determination that our products or manufacturing 

 15 

processes infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or entering a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes see part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – contingencies 

we have a number of intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make onetime or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the united states singapore taiwan japan malaysia and china additionally our control over operations at imft is limited by our agreements with intel from time to time we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment equipment failures earthquakes or other environmental events if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda 

on january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimondas insolvency proceedings filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor bv our netherlands subsidiary micron bv in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron bv and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron bv purchased substantially all of qimondas shares of inotera the inotera shares representing approximately 18 of inoteras outstanding shares and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks among other things to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent crosslicense between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement 

following a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate on march 13 2014 the court issued judgments 1 ordering micron bv to pay approximately 1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase 2 ordering micron bv to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties 3 ordering micron bv to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares including in particular any profits distributed on the inotera shares and all other benefits 4 denying qimonda’s claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera and 5 determining that qimondas obligations under the patent crosslicense agreement are canceled in addition the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering among other things 1 that micron bv transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by micron bv and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties and 2 that micron bv pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by micron bv from ownership of the inotera shares the interlocutory judgments have no immediate enforceable effect on us and accordingly we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case we have filed a notice of appeal and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court 

we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron bv from the ownership of the inotera shares andor the termination of the patent crosslicense which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

we may incur additional restructuring charges in future periods 

in separate transactions in 2017 we sold our assembly and test facility located in akita japan and our 40  ownership interest in tera probe assets associated with our 200mm fabrication facility in singapore and assets related to our lexar brand in 2016 we initiated a restructure plan in response to business conditions and the need to accelerate focus on our key priorities the plan included the elimination of certain projects and programs the permanent closure of a number of open headcount requisitions workforce reductions in certain areas of our business and other nonheadcount related spending reductions as a result of these and other actions we incurred charges of 18 million  67 million  and 3 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

we may not realize expected savings or other benefits from our restructure activities and may incur additional restructure charges or other losses in future periods associated with other initiatives in connection with any restructure initiatives we could incur restructure charges loss of production output loss of key personnel disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

breaches of our security systems could expose us to losses 

we maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities we also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations in addition we process store and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees including sensitive personal information unauthorized persons or employees may gain access to our facilities or network systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information compromise confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities breaches of our physical security and attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and may expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers suppliers or employees is compromised which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

across our global operations significant transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the euro singapore dollar new taiwan dollar and yen we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 74 million  for 2017 24 million for 2016 and 27 million for 2015 based on our foreign currency balances of monetary assets and liabilities as of august 31 2017  we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 391 million  although we hedge our primary exposures to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies exchange rates for some of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the yen have been volatile in recent periods if these currencies strengthen against the us dollar our manufacturing costs could significantly increase exchange rates for the us dollar that adversely change against our foreign currency exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may make future acquisitions andor alliances which involve numerous risks 

acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 



 17 

 

in previous years supply of memory and storage products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram and nand the global memory and storage industry has experienced consolidation and may continue to consolidate we engage from time to time in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with technology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the limited availability of raw materials supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations require raw materials and in certain cases third party services that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as chemicals silicon wafers gases photoresist controllers substrates lead frames printed circuit boards targets and reticle glass blanks shortages may occur from time to time in the future we andor our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past the disruption of our supply of raw materials or services or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to suppliers limited capacity our inability to obtain equipment on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce our costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and could increase our overall costs of a ramp our inability to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business 

downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers mobile devices ssds and servers reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result a downturn in the worldwide economy could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate 

we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events such as earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster fire explosion or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our 

 18 

operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the operations of mmj are subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings 

because mmjs plan of reorganization provides for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj the reorganization proceedings in japan the japan proceedings are continuing and mmj remains subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the reorganization proceedings the business trustee is responsible for overseeing the operation of the business of mmj other than oversight in relation to acts that need to be carried out in connection with the japan proceedings which are the responsibility of the legal trustee mmjs reorganization proceedings in japan and oversight of the japan court will continue until the final creditor payment is made under mmjs plan of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date mmj may petition the japan court for an early termination of the reorganization proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plan of reorganization are made although such early terminations are customarily granted there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition in this particular case 

during the pendency of the reorganization proceedings in japan mmj is obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to its businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling material disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of mmj or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of mmjs plan of reorganization accordingly during the pendency of the reorganization proceedings in japan our ability to operate mmj as part of our global business or to cause mmj to take certain actions that we deem advisable for its business could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to mmj 

the operations of mmj being subject to the continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

we operate in a number of locations outside the united states including singapore where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the geographic mix of our earnings among these jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including challenges by tax authorities to our tax positions and intercompany transfer pricing agreements income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements and changes in tax laws and regulations we file income tax returns with the us federal government various us states and various other jurisdictions throughout the world our us federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2013 through 2017 in addition tax returns that remain open to examination in japan range from the years 2011 to 2017 and in singapore and taiwan from 2012 to 2017 the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability the foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not utilize all of our net deferred tax assets 

we have substantial deferred tax assets which include among others net operating loss and credit carryforwards as of august 31 2017  our us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards including uncertain tax benefits were 388 billion  and 195 billion  respectively which if not utilized will expire at various dates from 2028 through 2037 and 2018 through 2037 respectively as of august 31 2017  our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were 630 billion  which will if not utilized substantially all expire at various dates from 2019 through 2026 as of august 31 2017  we had gross deferred tax assets of 378 billion  and valuation allowances of 232 billion  against our deferred tax assets if we repatriate earnings from our subsidiaries whose earnings are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested a portion of our net operating losses would be utilized utilization of all of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards would increase the amount of our annual cash taxes 

 19 

reducing the overall amount of cash available to be used in other areas of the business and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

a change in ownership may limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 

on january 18 2017 our shareholders approved a section 382 rights agreement the rights agreement under which our shareholders of record as of the close of business on august 1 2016 received one right for each share of common stock outstanding which entitles certain shareholders to purchase additional shares of our common stock at a significant discount in the event of certain transactions that may result in an ownership change as defined by section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code in general an ownership change will occur when the percentage of our ownership by one or more 5 shareholders has increased by more than 50 at any time during the prior three years rights will attach to all shares of the company’s common stock issued prior to the earlier of the rights distribution date or expiration date as set forth in the rights agreement pursuant to the rights agreement if a shareholder or group acquires beneficial ownership of 499 or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock without prior approval of our board or without meeting certain customary exceptions the rights other than rights held by the acquiring shareholder or group and certain related persons would become exercisable the rights agreement is intended to avoid an adverse ownership change thereby preserving our current ability to utilize certain net operating loss and credit carryforwards however there is no assurance that the rights agreement will prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change 

if we experience a 50 or greater change in ownership involving shareholders owning 5 or more of our common stock it could adversely impact our ability to utilize our existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards the inability to utilize existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards would significantly increase the amount of our annual cash taxes and reduce the overall amount of cash available to be used in other areas of the business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

compliance with regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act and its implementing sec regulations the doddfrank act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo the drc and finance or benefit local armed groups these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict free our inability to comply with the regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that may result in additional costs and liabilities 

the manufacturing of our products requires the use of facilities equipment and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate additionally we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction maintenance and operations of our facilities any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results additionally we partner with other companies in our joint ventures which are also subject to a broad array of laws and regulations our ownership in these joint ventures may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with these laws and regulations as a result of these items we could experience the following 

 

 20 

our failure or the failure of our joint ventures to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

sales to customers outside the united states approximated 86 of our consolidated net sales for 2017 in addition a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states in particular a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore taiwan and japan our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to counterparty default risks 

we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash deposits investments capped call contracts on our common stock and derivative instruments as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceedings in the event of such default we could incur significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

reorganization proceedings of the mmj companies 

in 2013 we completed the acquisition of elpida now known as mmj a japanese corporation pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement on support for reorganization companies as amended the sponsor agreement that we entered into in 2012 with the trustees of the mmj companies pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan under the sponsor agreement we agreed to provide certain support for the reorganization of the mmj companies and the trustees agreed to prepare and seek approval from the japan court and the mmj companies creditors of plan of reorganization consistent with such support 

the plan of reorganization provides for payments by the mmj companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items the plan of reorganization also provided for the investment by us pursuant to the sponsor agreement of 60 billion yen paid at closing in cash into mmj in exchange for 100 ownership of mmjs equity and the use of such investment to fund the initial installment payment by the mmj companies to their creditors of 60 billion yen subject to reduction for certain items specified in the sponsor agreement and plan of reorganization 

under mmjs plan of reorganization secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their fixed claims and unsecured creditors will recover at least 174 of the amount of their fixed claims the actual recovery of unsecured creditors will be higher however based in part on events and circumstances occurring following the plan approval the remaining portion of the unsecured claims will be discharged without payment over the period that payments are made pursuant to the plan of reorganization the secured creditors will be paid in full on or before the sixth installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments the unsecured creditors of mai were scheduled to be paid in seven  installments however in connection with our sale of mai in 2017 the remaining mai creditor obligation was paid in full and mais reorganization proceedings were closed 

 22 

because mmjs plan of reorganization provides for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of the mmj acquisition the reorganization proceedings in japan are continuing and mmj remains subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the reorganization proceedings the business trustee is responsible for overseeing the operation of the businesses of the mmj companies other than oversight in relation to acts that need to be carried out in connection with the japan proceedings which are the responsibility of the legal trustee mmjs reorganization proceedings in japan and oversight of the japan court will continue until the final creditor payment is made under mmjs plan of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date mmj may petition the japan court for an early termination of the reorganization proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plan of reorganization are made although such early terminations are customarily granted there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition in this particular case 

during the pendency of the reorganization proceedings in japan mmj is obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to its businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling material disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of mmj or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of mmjs plan of reorganization accordingly during the pendency of the reorganization proceedings in japan our ability to effectively integrate mmj as part of our global operations or to cause mmj to take certain actions that we deem advisable for its businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to mmj

results of operations 

consolidated results 



net sales 



percentages of total net sales reflect rounding and may not total 100 

total net sales for 2017 increased 64 as compared to 2016 due to strong conditions across our primary markets particularly for enterprise mobile client and ssd storage the strong market conditions drove higher sales in 2017 for all 

 27 

operating segments and significant increases in sales volumes for both dram and trade nand products as well as increases in average selling prices for dram products increases in sales volumes for 2017 as compared 2016 were enabled by higher manufacturing output due to improvements in product and process technology and solid execution 

total net sales for 2016 decreased 23 as compared to 2015 primarily due to lower cnbu mbu and sbu sales as declines in average selling prices outpaced increases in sales volumes the increases in sales volumes for 2016 were primarily attributable to higher manufacturing output due to improvements in product and process technology partially offset by reductions resulting from technology node transitions 

gross margin 

our overall gross margin percentage increased to 42 for 2017 from 20 for 2016 reflecting increases in the gross margin percentages for all operating segments primarily due to strong markets that drove favorable pricing conditions and to manufacturing cost reductions from improvements in product and process technology and solid execution 

our overall gross margin percentage declined to 20 for 2016 from 32 for 2015 primarily due to declines in the gross margin percentages for cnbu mbu and sbu as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions ebus gross margin percentage for 2016 was relatively unchanged from 2015 as manufacturing cost reductions offset declines in average selling prices 

we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment in the fourth quarter of 2016 we identified factors such as the lengthening period of time between dram product technology node transitions an increased reuse rate of equipment and industry trends as a result we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five  to seven  years in the fourth quarter of 2016 the effect of the revision was not material for 2016 and reduced depreciation costs by approximately 100 million  per quarter in 2017 

from january 2013 through december 2015 we purchased all of inoteras dram output under supply agreements at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components after december 2015 through december 6 2016 the date we acquired the remaining interest in inotera the price for dram products purchased by us from inotera was based on a formula that equally shared margin between inotera and us under these agreements we purchased 504 million  143 billion  and 237 billion  of dram products from inotera in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively which represented 9 of our aggregate dram gigabit production for 2017 30 for 2016 and 35 for 2015 in accounting for the inotera acquisition inoteras work in process inventories were recorded at fair value based on their estimated future selling prices estimated costs to complete and other factors and was approximately 107 million higher than the cost of work in process inventory recorded by inotera prior to the acquisition the acquired inventory was sold in 2017 

operating results by business segments 

cnbu 



cnbu sales for 2017 increased 90 as compared to 2016 due to increases in average selling prices for our products sold in the client market growth in the cloud market driven by significant increases in dram content per server and increases in sales of our gddr5 and gddr5x products into the graphics market driven by strong demand from the gaming industry growth in cnbu markets drove increases for 2017 in average selling prices and sales volumes as compared to 2016 cnbu operating margin for 2017 improved from 2016 primarily due to improved pricing from strong market conditions manufacturing cost reductions and product mix see operating results by product – dram for further detail 

cnbu sales for 2016 decreased 33 as compared to 2015 primarily due to declines in average selling prices as a result of weakness in the pc sector partially offset by increases in sales volumes cnbu operating margin for 2016 declined from 2015 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions 

 28 

sbu 



sbu sales of trade nand products for 2017 increased 41 as compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in sales volumes from strong demand particularly for component nand and client and cloud ssd storage products partially offset by declines in average selling prices sbu sales of ssd storage products increased by 137 for 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily as a result of the launch of new ssd products incorporating our 3d tlc nand technology sbu sales included nontrade sales of 553 million  501 million  and 463 million  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively sbu operating margin for 2017 improved from 2016 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions partially offset by declines in average selling prices see operating results by product – trade nand for further details 

sbu sales of trade nand products for 2016 decreased 16 from 2015 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by increases in sales volumes sbu operating margin for 2016 declined from 2015 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions 

mbu 



mbu sales are comprised primarily of dram and nand with mobile dram products accounting for a significant majority of the sales mbu sales for 2017 increased 72 as compared to 2016 primarily due to significant increases in sales 

volumes driven by customer qualifications for lpdram and managed nand products combined with higher memory content in smartphones and growth in sales of emcp products sales growth in 2017 was partially offset by declines in average selling prices for trade nand products mbu operating income for 2017 improved from 2016 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions and higher sales volumes partially offset by higher rd costs and declines in average selling prices for trade nand products 

mbu sales for 2016 decreased 30 as compared to 2015 primarily due to declines in average selling prices and dram sales volumes mbu operating income for 2016 declined from 2015 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions 

ebu 



ebu sales are comprised of dram nand and nor flash in decreasing order of revenue ebu sales for 2017 increased 39 as compared to 2016 primarily due to strong demand and higher sales volumes for dram and emcp in consumer markets and dram and emmc products in the automotive markets ebu operating income for 2017 increased as compared to 2016 as a result of manufacturing cost reductions which outpaced declines in average selling prices and increases in sales volumes 

ebu sales for 2016 decreased 3 as compared to 2015 primarily due to declines in average selling prices for dram and nand products which were partially offset by higher sales volumes as a result of increases in demand ebu operating income for 2016 was relatively unchanged from 2015 as manufacturing cost reductions offset declines in average selling prices

operating results by product 

net sales by product 



percentages of total net sales reflect rounding and may not total 100 

nontrade primarily consists of nand and 3d xpoint products manufactured and sold to intel through imft under a longterm supply agreement at prices approximating cost information regarding products that combine both nand and dram components is reported within trade nand other includes sales of nor and trade 3d xpoint products 

dram 



strong conditions in 2017 for enterprise client mobile graphics and networking markets as well as key customer qualifications drove increases in sales volumes and prices as compared to 2016 the reductions in cost for 2017 and 2016 as compared to prior years were primarily due to improvements in product and process technology for 2017 compared to 2016 lower depreciation due to the change made in the fourth quarter of 2016 in estimated useful lives for equipment at our dram wafer fabrication facilities contributed to cost reductions 

our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2017 improved from 2016 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions increases in average selling prices and shifts in product mix while our gross margin percentage for 2016 declined as compared to 2015 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions 

trade nand 



strong conditions in 2017 for ssd mobile and client storage markets drove increases in net sales as compared to 2016 particularly for ssd and mobile products our ability to meet this demand was due in part to increases in production primarily from the ramp of capacity and improvements in product and process technology including our transition to 3d nand products the increase in sales volumes of trade nand for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases in demand and increases in production due to improvements in product and process technology increases in production for 2016 were constrained in connection with transitioning to 3d nand products 

our gross margin percentage on sales of trade nand for 2017 improved from 2016 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices while our gross margin percentage for 2016 declined from 2015 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions

operating expenses and other 

selling general and administrative 

sga expenses for 2017 were 13 higher than 2016 primarily due to increases in performancebased pay transaction costs related to the inotera acquisition and stockbased compensation partially offset by a reduction in other payroll costs sga expenses for 2016 were 8 lower than 2015 due to decreases in performancebased pay and travel costs and to an additional week in 2015 

research and development 

rd expenses for 2017 were 13 higher than 2016 primarily due to higher volumes of product being processed that had not been qualified and increases in performancebased pay partially offset by lower subcontracted engineering and other professional services costs rd expenses for 2016 were 5 higher than 2015 primarily due to higher volumes of product being processed that had not been qualified higher payroll costs an increase in depreciation expense from rd capital expenditures partially offset by an additional week in 2015 

we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand and 3d xpoint memory at imft and our other facilities our rd expenses reflect net reductions as a result of reimbursements under our costsharing arrangements with intel of 213 million 205 million and 224 million in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

see further discussion of our rd in part i – item 1 – business – research and development 

income taxes 

our income taxes reflect operations in tax jurisdictions including singapore and taiwan where our earnings are indefinitely reinvested and the tax rates are significantly lower than the us statutory rate operations outside the united states including singapore where we have tax incentive arrangements that further decrease our effective tax rates and a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets in the united states income tax provision benefit consisted of the following 



income taxes for 2017 and 2016 included tax benefits of 28 million and 58 million respectively related to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters which were previously reserved as uncertain tax positions 

we have a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset associated with our us operations management continues to evaluate future projected financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support a reduction in or reversal of the valuation allowance the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if sufficient positive evidence exists 

we operate in a number of locations outside the unites states including singapore where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds the effect of tax incentive arrangements which expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2030 reduced our tax provision by 742 million  benefiting our diluted earnings per share by 064  for 2017  were not material in 2016  and by 338 million   029  per diluted share for 2015

equity in net income loss of equity method investees 

we recognize our share of earnings or losses from equity method investments generally on a twomonth lag equity in net income loss of equity method investees net of tax included the following 



on december 6 2016 we ceased accounting for inotera as an equity method investment due to our acquisition of the remaining interest in inotera our equity in net income loss of inotera declined for 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to the effect to inotera under our supply agreements with them of declines in average selling prices and inoteras cost of technology node transitions included in our earnings for 2015 was 49 million from our equity share of inoteras full release of its valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets related to its net operating loss carryforward 

 in 2017 we ceased recognizing our share of tera probes earnings due to our sale of our equity interest in tera probe we recorded impairment charges of 16 million  25 million  and 10 million  in 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively within equity in net income loss of equity method investees to write down the carrying value of our investment in tera probe to its then fair value in each of those periods based on its trading price 

other 

net interest expense increased 42 for 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to increases in debt obligations including our borrowings of 80 billion  new taiwan dollars at an effective interest rate of 302  on december 6 2016 in connection with our acquisition of inotera and 125 billion at an effective interest rate of 769  in april 2016 under the 2023 secured notes net interest expense increased 18 for 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to increases in debt obligations 

further discussion of other operating and nonoperating income and expenses can be found in the following notes contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets and financial institutions cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products which can vary significantly from period to period we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding our capital expenditures and ongoing operations we expect from time to time in the future to engage in a variety of financing transactions for such purposes including the issuance of securities we have a revolving credit facility that expires in february 2020 and provides for additional borrowings of up to 750 million  based on eligible receivables we expect that our cash and investments cash flows from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months 

to develop new product and process technology support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and equipment and rd we estimate that expenditures in 2018 for property plant and equipment net of partner contributions to be in the range of 75 billion plus or minus 5 percent focused on technology transitions and product enablement the actual amounts for 2018 will vary depending on market conditions as of august 31 2017  we had commitments of approximately 11 billion  for the acquisition of property plant and equipment substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year 

cash and marketable investments totaled 605 billion  and 481 billion  as of august 31 2017  and september 1 2016  respectively our investments consist primarily of liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities diversified among industries

 35 

the contractual obligations in the table above include the current portions of the related longterm obligations all other current liabilities are excluded 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we entered into capped call transactions in connection with certain of our convertible notes and are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution the capped calls provide for our receipt of cash or shares at our election from our counterparties if the trading price of our stock is above strike prices on the expiration dates as of august 31 2017 the dollar value of cash or shares that we would receive from our outstanding capped calls upon their expiration dates range from 0 if the trading price of our stock is below strike prices for all of the capped calls at expiration to 527 million  if the trading price of our stock is at or above the cap prices for all capped calls settlement of the capped calls prior to the expiration dates may be for an amount less than the maximum value at expiration for further details of our capped call arrangements see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – equity – micron shareholders equity – outstanding capped calls 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

business acquisitions  accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized in subsequent periods accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows discount rates and comparable market values the items involving significant assumptions estimates and judgments include the following 

 

consolidation  we have interests in entities that are vies determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing whether an entity is a vie and if we are the entitys primary beneficiary if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we are required to consolidate it to determine if we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies require significant assumptions and judgments 

contingencies  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies significant judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss if any from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as 

 36 

of the balance sheet date in accounting for the resolution of contingencies significant judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods 

goodwill and intangible assets   we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform the goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the fair value of the reporting unit for reporting units for which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value goodwill is tested for impairment by determining the fair value of each reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then we would record an impairment loss up to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value 

determining when to test for impairment the reporting units the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates forecasted manufacturing costs and other expenses and are developed as part of our longrange planning process the same estimates are used in business planning forecasting and capital budgeting as part of our longterm manufacturing capacity analysis we test the reasonableness of the output of our longrange planning process by calculating an implied value per share and comparing that to current stock prices analysts consensus pricing and managements expectations these estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit which are discounted using a riskadjusted rate to estimate a fair value the discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

we test other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows estimating fair values involves significant assumptions including future sales prices sales volumes costs and discount rates 

income taxes  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve significant judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in recent periods our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and taiwan our income tax provision or benefit is dependent in part on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve significant judgments including among others projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes manufacturing and overhead costs levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value cost includes depreciation labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining net realizable value of inventories involves significant judgments including projecting future average selling prices sales volumes and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated net realizable values below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when inventories are actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our inventory by approximately 439 million as of august 31 2017 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory and storage markets actual selling prices and 

 37 

volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories in determining the lower of average cost or net realizable value inventories are primarily categorized as memory including dram nand and other memory based on the major characteristics of product type and markets the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 

property plant and equipment  we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimate of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require significant judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition significant judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016 the effect of the revision was not material for 2016 and reduced depreciation costs by approximately 100 million  per quarter in 2017 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – significant accounting policies 

research and development  costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires significant judgment by us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are included in cost of goods sold 

stockbased compensation   stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on our assessment of the likelihood of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires significant judgment 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires significant judgment including estimating stock price volatility and expected option life we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock options we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio as of august 31 2017  and september 1 2016  we had debt with fixed interest rates of 57 billion and 75 billion respectively and as a result the fair value of our debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates we estimate that as of august 31 2017  and september 1 2016  a decrease in market interest rates of 1 would increase the fair value of our fixedrate debt by approximately 273 million and 420 million respectively as of august 31 2017  and september 1 2016  we had debt with variable interest rates of 42 billion and 10 billion respectively as of august 31 2017  and september 1 2016  a 1 increase in the interest rates of our variablerate debt would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately 43 million and 10 million per year respectively 

as of august 31 2017  and september 1 2016  we held fixedrate debt investment securities of 148 billion and 111 billion respectively which were subject to interest rate risk we estimate that a 05 increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of these instruments by approximately 2 million as of august 31 2017  and 1 million as of september 1 2016  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in part i – item 1a risk factors changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the functional currency for all of our operations is the us dollar the substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the us dollar however significant amounts of our debt operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro new taiwan dollar singapore dollar and yen we have established currency risk management programs for our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs which reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

based on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 391 million  as of august 31 2017  and 241 million  as of september 1 2016  we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within nine  months in addition we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts that mature in december 2017 and december 2018 to hedge our currency exchange rate risk on certain debt the effectiveness of our hedges is dependent among other factors upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures we may utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12  months see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – derivative instruments

an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act are recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the commissions rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decision regarding disclosure 

on december 6 2016 we acquired the remaining 67 interest in inotera and began consolidating inotera as a result we are currently integrating inoteras operations into our overall internal control over financial reporting under the guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company and accordingly we expect to exclude inotera from the assessment of internal control over financial reporting during that time 

during the fourth quarter of 2017  there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

managements report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in internal control – integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this evaluation management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of august 31 2017  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of august 31 2017  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included in part ii item 8 of this form 10k

manufacturing 

our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china japan malaysia singapore and taiwan inotera has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is generally replaced every five to seven years with increasingly advanced equipment dram nand flash 3d xpoint memory and nor flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines in 2015 we began construction of a significant expansion of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore for production of nand flash memory and we began utilizing a portion of the facility for production in the second half of 2016 

our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment we continuously enhance our production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in the second half of 2016 the majority of our dram production was manufactured on our 20nm linewidth process technologies we expect to ramp volume production of 1xnm process node dram in 2017 beginning in the first quarter of 2017 we expect a majority of our nand flash production to be manufactured using our first generation 3d nand technology in 2017 we expect to ramp our second generation 64layer 3d nand technology and we expect triplelevelcell to become the majority of our 3d nand output 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process perform high temperature burnin on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition we use our proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost we use subcontractors to perform certain testing services 

we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie bare die forms our packaged products include memory modules ssds mcps managed nand memory cards usb devices and hmcs we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment we subcontract assembly services for the production of certain memory modules ssds mcps memory cards and usb devices 

in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines

availability of raw materials and use of service providers 

our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability and increase the cost of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we and our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers contract manufacturers logistic carriers and other service providers we have made significant investments in supply chain risk monitoring and management to mitigate our risks associated with raw materials and service providers 

marketing and customers 

market concentrations from 2016  net sales were approximately as follows 20  for compute and graphics including desktop pcs notebooks and workstations 20  for mobile 20  for ssd and other storage 15  for automotive industrial medical and other embedded and 10  for server sales to intel including nonvolatile memory through imft were 14  of our net sales in 2016  8  of our net sales in 2015  and 8  of our net sales in 2014  sales to kingston primarily dram were 7  of our net sales in 2016  11  of our net sales in 2015  and 10  of our net sales in 2014  

our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron ®  lexar crucial ®  spectek ®  and elpida ®  brand names and private labels we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world we sell lexarbranded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several months

because of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

product warranty 

because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery under our standard terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions

competition 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc toshiba corporation and western digital corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments such as china have provided and may continue to provide significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some of our competitors have plans to or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition many of our highvolume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors for these highvolume memory products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factors for our other memory products the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence over pricing 

research and development 

our process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of process technologies that enable successively smaller linewidths additional 3d memory layers and additional bits per cell ie cell levels we are also focused on developing new fundamentally different memory structures materials and packages which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr4 and ddr5 dram and lpdram products as well as high density and mobile 3d nand flash memory including tlc and qlc technologies 3d xpoint memory ssds including firmware and controllers managed nand specialty memory nor flash memory and other memory technologies and systems 

our rd expenses were 162 billion  154 billion  and 137 billion  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand flash memory and 3d xpoint memory our rd expenses reflect net reductions of 208 million 231 million and 162 million in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively as a result of reimbursements under our costsharing arrangements with intel and others 

to compete in the semiconductor memory industry we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions our process design and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world with our largest rd center located in boise idaho and other significant rd centers in japan china italy singapore and other sites in the us in 2016 we commenced construction on an expansion of our rd facility in boise 

rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have from time to time licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties some of these license agreements require us to make onetime or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

employees 

as of september 1 2016  we had approximately 31400 employees 

environmental compliance 

government regulations impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges emissions and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes in 2016 our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of iso 14001 certification to continue certification we must meet annual requirements in environmental policy compliance planning management structure and responsibility training communication document control operational control emergency preparedness and response record keeping and management review while we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures modification of our operations or other compliance actions

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from past results and those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by us the order of these factors is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each poses to us our operations could also be affected by other factors that are presently unknown to us or not considered significant the factors below could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and stock price 

we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business 

if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in previous years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future in some prior periods average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future 



we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins 

our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs including but not limited to process linewidth additional 3d memory layers additional bits per cell ie cell levels architecture number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and yield in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes difficulties in transitioning to smaller linewidth process technologies technological barriers and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products 

the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sk hynix inc toshiba corporation and western digital corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments such as china have provided and may continue to provide significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and downward pressure on prices increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply we and some of our competitors have plans to or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition if competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology their products could have cost or performance advantages 

 13 

debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition 

in recent periods our debt levels have increased due to the capital intensive nature of our business business acquisitions and restructuring of our capital structure as of september 1 2016  we had debt with a carrying value of 991 billion  in 2016 2015 and 2014 we paid 94 million  143 billion 230 billion respectively to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with principal amounts of and 57 million 489 million and 109 billion respectively as of september 1 2016  we had a revolving credit facility available for up to 488 million  of additional financing the availability of this revolving facility is subject to certain conditions including outstanding balances of eligible receivables events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy these applicable drawdown conditions and utilize this facility we have incurred in the past and expect to incur in the future debt to finance our capital investments business acquisitions and restructuring of our capital structure in 2016 we issued 125 billion of our 2023 secured notes and 750 million of our 2022 term loan b and received an aggregate of 765 million  in equipment saleleaseback financing transactions in connection with our proposed acquisition of the remaining interest in inotera we plan to fund a portion of the acquisition with a loan of up to 80 billion new taiwan dollars equivalent to 25 billion under the term loan facility and at our option 126 billion  new taiwan dollars equivalent to 396 million of 2021 convertible notes the date for the closing of the inotera transaction has been set by the inotera board for december 6 2016 consummation of the inotera transaction remains subject to certain closing conditions and there can be no assurance that the inotera transaction will be consummated 

our debt obligations could adversely impact us for example these obligations could 

 

our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future this to some extent is subject to market economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rd and product and process technology we estimate that net cash expenditures in 2017 for property plant and equipment will be approximately 48 billion to 52 billion which reflects the offset of amounts we expect to be funded by our partners investments in capital expenditures offset by amounts funded by our partners were 540 billion for 2016 as of september 1 2016  we had cash and marketable investments of 481 billion  as of september 1 2016  919 million of cash and equivalents and shortterm investments including substantially all of the 896 million held by the mmj group were held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the us would subject these funds to us federal income taxes in addition cash held by imft of 98 million  was generally not available to finance our other operations 

 14 

as a result of the japan proceedings for so long as such proceedings are continuing the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies installment payments these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the mmj companies as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court as a result the assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries while available to satisfy the mmj companies installment payments and the other obligations capital expenditures and other operating needs of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are not available for use by us in our other operations furthermore certain uses of the assets of the mmj group including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt may require consent of mmjs trustees andor the japan court 

in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our debt levels expected debt amortization and general economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions 

our proposed acquisition of the remaining shares of inotera involves numerous risks 

in the second quarter of 2016 we entered into agreements to acquire the remaining interest in inotera for 30 new taiwan dollars per share in cash equivalent to approximately 095  per share as of september 1 2016  we held a 33  ownership interest in inotera nanya and certain of its affiliates held a 32  ownership interest and the remaining ownership interest in inotera was publicly held based on the exchange rate as of september 1 2016  we estimate the aggregate consideration payable for the 67  of inotera shares not owned by us would be approximately 41 billion  we anticipate financing the acquisition with a combination of the following 

 

on march 29 2016 the transaction was approved by the shareholders of inotera including nanya and certain of nanyas affiliates which approval was provided pursuant to voting and support agreements on october 11 2016 the inotera board set the date for the closing of the transaction to be december 6 2016 consummation of the inotera transaction is subject to significant uncertainties certain termination rights and various conditions including regulatory approvals and the consummation of debt financing there can be no assurance that the various conditions will be satisfied or that the inotera transaction will ultimately be consummated if the remaining closing conditions are not satisfied or waived we will be unable to close the acquisition 

  

in addition to the acquisition risks described elsewhere the acquisition is expected to involve the following significant risks 

  



 15 

 

our proposed acquisition of the remaining shares of inotera is inherently risky may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition see part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – proposed acquisition of inotera 

our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies 

our key semiconductor memory technologies of dram and nand flash face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability to meet these requirements we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance and cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies    there can be no assurance of the following 

 

in 2015 we announced the development of new 3d xpoint technology which is an entirely new class of nonvolatile memory there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market this new product technology will be successful if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

new product development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products including systemlevel memory products which complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop dram nand flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance of the following 

• that our product development efforts will be successful 

• that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products 

• that we will be able to successfully market these products 

• that we will be able to qualify new products with our customers on a timely basis or 

• that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 

if our efforts to develop new products are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

products that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 



 16 

 

a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – contingencies 

we have a number of intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make onetime or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda 

on january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimonda insolvency proceedings filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor bv our netherlands subsidiary micron bv in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron bv and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron bv purchased substantially all of qimondas shares of inotera memories inc the inotera shares representing approximately 55 of our total shares in inotera as of september 1 2016 and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks among other things to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent crosslicense between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement 

following a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate on march 13 2014 the court issued judgments 1 ordering micron bv to pay approximately 1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase 2 ordering micron bv to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties 3 ordering micron bv to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares including in particular any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits 4 denying qimonda’s claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera and 5 determining that qimondas obligations under the patent crosslicense agreement are canceled in addition the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering among other things 1 that micron bv transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by it and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties and 2 that micron bv pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares the interlocutory judgments have no immediate enforceable effect on us and accordingly we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case we have filed a notice of appeal and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court 

we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron bv from the ownership of the inotera shares andor the termination of the patent crosslicense which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as of september 1 2016  the inotera shares had a carrying value for purposes of our financial reporting of 674 million  and a market value of 996 million  

 17 

our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks 

we have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these relationships include our imft joint venture with intel and our inotera joint venture with nanya these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the following 

 

if our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

if our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the us singapore taiwan japan malaysia and china additionally our control over operations at imft inotera and tera probe is limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment equipment failures earthquakes or other environmental events if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships any of which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur additional restructure charges in future periods 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 we initiated a restructure plan in response to the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on our key priorities in which we expect to save as compared to our previously planned spending levels approximately 80 million per quarter in 2017 the savings are expected to result from a combination of a more focused set of projects and programs the permanent closure of a number of open headcount requisitions workforce reductions in certain areas of the business and other nonheadcount related spending reductions in connection with the plan we expect to incur charges of 80 million  substantially all in cash expenditures of which 58 million  was incurred in 2016 with the remainder in the early part of 2017 

we may not realize the expected quarterly cost savings we may also incur additional restructure charges or other losses associated with other initiatives in future periods in connection with those initiatives we could incur restructure charges loss of production output loss of key personnel disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products

the operations of the mmj companies are subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings 

because the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj the japan proceedings are continuing and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the japan proceedings the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition 

during the pendency of the japan proceedings the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively operate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companies 

our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks 

in 2016 we purchased 143 billion  of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 30 of our aggregate dram gigabit production in 2015 and 2014 our cost for inotera products was higher than the cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to declines in average selling prices our per gigabit cost of products purchased from inotera decreased throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016 such that our cost for inotera products more closely approximated our cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities for the second and third quarters of 2016 due to improvements in average selling prices in late 2016 coupled with decreases in manufacturing costs of our whollyowned operations our cost for inotera products increased and were approximately 20 higher than our cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities for the fourth quarter of 2016 if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks including the following 

 

 19 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

across our global operations certain transactions and balances are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the euro singapore dollar new taiwan dollar and yen we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 24 million  for 2016 27 million for 2015 and 28 million for 2014 based on our foreign currency balances from monetary assets and liabilities we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 241 million  as of september 1 2016  although we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies exchange rates for some of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the yen have been volatile in recent periods if these currencies strengthen against the us dollar our manufacturing costs could significantly increase in the event that exchange rates for the us dollar adversely change against our foreign currency exposures our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected in addition in connection with our proposed acquisition of inotera our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates could increase if not offset by corresponding hedges 

we may make future acquisitions andor alliances which involve numerous risks 

acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 

 

in previous years supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram nand flash and nor flash products resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants including the liquidation of qimonda and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida now known as mmj these types of proceedings often lead to courtdirected processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 20 

breaches of our security systems could expose us to losses 

we maintain a system of controls over the physical security of our facilities we also manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations in addition we process store and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees including sensitive personal information unauthorized persons or employees may gain access to our facilities or network systems to steal trade secrets or other proprietary information compromise confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities breaches of our physical security and attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and suppliers and could expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers suppliers or employees is compromised 

compliance with regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act and its implementing securities and exchange commission regulations the doddfrank act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo the drc and finance or benefit local armed groups these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict free 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations that may result in additional costs and liabilities 

the manufacturing of our products requires the use of facilities equipment and materials that are subject to a broad array of laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate additionally we are subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relative to the construction maintenance and operations of our facilities any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs as well as increased indirect costs related to our relationships with our customers and suppliers and otherwise harm our operations and financial condition any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could adversely impact our reputation and our financial results additionally we partner with other companies in our joint ventures which are also subject to a broad array of laws and regulations our ownership in these joint ventures may also expose us to risks associated with their respective compliance with these laws and regulations our failure or the failure of our joint ventures to comply with these laws and regulations could result in 

 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

we operate in a number of locations outside the us including in singapore and to a lesser extent taiwan where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the distribution of our earnings among these different jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including challenges by tax authorities to our tax structure and intercompany transfer pricing agreements income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements and changes in tax laws and regulations we file income tax returns with the us federal government various us states and various other jurisdictions throughout the world our us federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2012 through 2016 in addition tax returns open to examination in singapore japan and taiwan range from the years 2011 to 2016 the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

 21 

we may not utilize all of our net deferred tax assets 

we have substantial deferred tax assets which include among others net operating loss and credit carryforwards as of september 1 2016 our us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards including uncertain tax benefits were 390 billion and 194 billion respectively which if not utilized will expire at various dates from 2017 through 2036 as of september 1 2016 our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were 604 billion including 428 billion pertaining to japan which will if not utilized substantially all expire at various dates from 2019 through 2025 as of september 1 2016 we had valuation allowances of 116 billion and 765 million against our net deferred tax assets in the us and japan respectively 

a change in ownership may limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 

if we experience a 50 or greater change in ownership involving shareholders owning 5 or more of our stock it could adversely impact our ability to utilize our existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards the inability to utilize existing net operating loss and credit carryforwards would significantly increase the amount of our annual cash taxes reducing the overall amount of cash available to be used in other areas of the business 

on july 20 2016 our board of directors adopted a section 382 rights agreement the rights agreement under which our shareholders of record as of the close of business on august 1 2016 received one right for each share of common stock outstanding the rights agreement is intended to avoid an ownership change as defined by section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and thereby preserve our current ability to utilize certain net operating loss and credit carryforwards in general an ownership change will occur when the percentage of our ownership by one or more 5 shareholders has increased by more than 50 at any time during the prior three years pursuant to the rights agreement if a shareholder or group acquires beneficial ownership of 499 or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock without prior approval of our board of directors or without meeting certain customary exceptions the rights would become exercisable and entitle shareholders other than the acquiring shareholder or group to purchase additional shares of our common stock at a significant discount and result in significant dilution in the economic interest and voting power of acquiring shareholder or group although the rights agreement is intended to reduce the likelihood of an ownership change that could adversely affect us there is no assurance that the rights agreement will prevent all transfers that could result in such an ownership change the rights agreement is subject to shareholder approval at the company’s fiscal 2016 annual meeting of shareholders if not approved by the shareholders the rights agreement will terminate on july 19 2017 

the limited availability of raw materials supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations require raw materials and in certain cases third party services that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as silicon wafers controllers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we andor our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials or services is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the suppliers limited capacity our inability to obtain this equipment timely could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp if we are unable to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 22 

a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business 

downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers mobile devices ssds and servers reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate 

we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster fire explosion or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

sales to customers outside the united states approximated 84 of our consolidated net sales for 2016 in addition a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states in particular a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore taiwan and japan our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

these factors may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject to counterparty default risks 

we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash deposits investments cappedcall contracts on our stock and derivative instruments as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding in the event of such default we could incur significant losses which could adversely impact our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

reorganization proceedings of the mmj companies 

in july 2013 we completed the acquisition of elpida now known as mmj a japanese corporation pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement on support for reorganization companies as amended the sponsor agreement that we entered into in july 2012 with the trustees of the mmj companies pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan the mmj companies filed petitions for commencement of corporate reorganization proceedings with the japan court under the corporate reorganization act of japan in february 2012 and the japan court issued an order to commence the reorganization proceedings the japan proceedings in march 2012 under the sponsor agreement we agreed to provide certain support for the reorganization of the mmj companies and the trustees agreed to prepare and seek approval from the japan court and the mmj companies creditors of plans of reorganization consistent with such support 

the trustees initially submitted the proposed plans of reorganization for the mmj companies to the japan court in august 2012 and submitted final proposed plans in october 2012 in october 2012 the japan court approved submission of the trustees proposed plans of reorganization to creditors for approval in february 2013 the mmj companies creditors approved the reorganization plans and in february 2013 the japan court issued an order approving the plans of reorganization appeals filed by certain creditors of mmj in japan challenging the plan approval order issued by the japan court were denied 

in a related action mmj filed a verified petition for recognition and chapter 15 relief in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the us court in march 2012 and in april 2012 the us court entered an order that among other things recognized mmjs corporate reorganization proceeding as a foreign main proceeding pursuant to 11 usc § 1517b on june 25 2013 the us court issued a recognition order which recognized the order of the japan court approving mmjs plan of reorganization in november 2013 the us court closed the us chapter 15 proceeding 

the plans of reorganization provide for payments by the mmj companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items the plans of reorganization also provided for the investment by us pursuant to the sponsor agreement of 60 billion yen paid at closing in cash into mmj in exchange for 100 ownership of mmjs equity and the use of such investment to fund the initial installment payment by the mmj companies to their creditors of 60 billion yen subject to reduction for certain items specified in the sponsor agreement and plans of reorganization 

under mmjs plan of reorganization secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their fixed claims and unsecured creditors will recover at least 174 of the amount of their fixed claims the actual recovery of unsecured creditors will be higher however based in part on events and circumstances occurring following the plan approval the remaining portion of the unsecured claims will be discharged without payment over the period that payments are made pursuant to the plans of reorganization the secured creditors will be paid in full on or before the sixth installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments mais plan of reorganization provides that secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their claims whereas unsecured creditors will recover 19 of the amount of their claims the secured creditors of mai were paid in full on the first installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments 

because the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of the mmj acquisition the japan proceedings are continuing and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the reorganization proceedings the business trustee makes decisions in relation to the operation of the businesses of the mmj companies other than decisions in relation to acts that need to be carried out in connection with the japan proceedings which are the responsibility of the legal trustee the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court will continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date the mmj companies may petition the japan court for an early termination of the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made although such early terminations are customarily granted there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition in these particular cases 

 25 

during the pendency of the japan proceedings the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling material disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively integrate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companies

results of operations 

consolidated results 



net sales 



percentages of total net sales reflect rounding and may not total 100 

total net sales for 2016 decreased 23 as compared to 2015 primarily due to lower cnbu mbu and sbu sales as declines in average selling prices outpaced increases in gigabit sales volumes the increases in gigabit sales volumes for 2016 were primarily attributable to higher manufacturing output due to improvements in product and process technologies partially offset by reductions resulting from transitions to the next technology node 

total net sales for 2015 decreased 1 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower cnbu sales as a result of decreases in dram sales as declines in average selling prices outpaced increases in gigabit sales volumes sbu and mbu sales for 2015 increased as compared to 2014 as a result of higher nand flash sales due to increases in gigabit sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices the increases in gigabit sales volumes for 2015 were primarily attributable to higher manufacturing output due to improvements in product and process technologies ebu sales for 2015 increased as compared to 2014 due to higher sales volumes as a result of increases in market demand 

gross margin 

our overall gross margin percentage declined to 20 for 2016 from 32 for 2015 primarily due to declines in the gross margin percentages for cnbu mbu and sbu as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions ebus gross margin percentage for 2016 was relatively unchanged from 2015 as manufacturing cost reductions offset declines in average selling prices 

 31 

from january 2013 through december 2015 we purchased all of inoteras dram output under supply agreements at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components effective beginning on january 1 2016 the price for dram products purchased by us is based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us we purchased 143 billion  237 billion  and 268 billion  of dram products from inotera in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively dram products purchased from inotera accounted for 30 of our aggregate dram gigabit production for 2016 as compared to 35 for 2015 and 38 for 2014 in 2015 and 2014 our cost for inotera products was higher than our cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to declines in average selling prices our per gigabit cost of products purchased from inotera decreased throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016 such that our cost for inotera products more closely approximated our cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities for the second and third quarters of 2016 due to improvements in average selling prices in late 2016 coupled with decreases in manufacturing costs of our whollyowned operations our cost for inotera products increased and were approximately 20 higher than our cost for similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities for the fourth quarter of 2016 the current supply agreement with inotera has an initial threeyear term which commenced on january 1 2016 followed by a threeyear winddown period upon termination of the initial threeyear term the share of inoteras capacity we would purchase would decline over the winddown period 

our overall gross margin percentage declined to 32 for 2015 from 33 for 2014 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions cnbu and sbu experienced declines in gross margin percentage for 2015 as compared to 2014 as declines in average selling price outpaced manufacturing cost reductions mbus gross margin percentage for 2015 improved as compared to 2014 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices 

due to the lengthening period of time between dram product technology node transitions an increased reuse rate of equipment and industry trends we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016 for 2016 the effect of the revision was not material and we expect this change will reduce depreciation costs by approximately 100 million per quarter in future periods

sbu sales of trade nonvolatile memory products for 2015 increased 7 as compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices increases in gigabits sold for 2015 as compared to 2014 were primarily due to higher manufacturing output sbu operating margin for 2015 declined from 2014 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions and rd costs increased in connection with increased spending on controllers firmware and engineering for ssds and managed nand flash products 

mbu 



mbu sales are comprised primarily of dram and nand flash with mobile dram products accounting for a significant majority of the sales mbu sales for 2016 decreased 30 as compared to 2015 primarily due to declines in average selling prices and dram gigabits sold mbu operating income for 2016 declined from 2015 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions 

mbu sales for 2015 increased 2 as compared to 2014 primarily due to significant increases in gigabit sales volumes for managed nand flash and mcp products partially offset by lower sales of mobile dram products as a result of declines in average selling prices and sales volumes mbu operating income for 2015 improved from 2014 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices 

ebu 



ebu sales are comprised of dram nand flash and nor flash in decreasing order of revenue ebu sales for 2016 decreased 3 as compared to 2015 primarily due to declines in average selling prices for dram and nand flash products which were partially offset by higher sales volumes as a result of increases in demand ebu operating income for 2016 was relatively unchanged from 2015 as manufacturing cost reductions offset declines in average selling prices 

ebu sales for 2015 increased 13 as compared to 2014 primarily due to higher sales volumes of dram and nand flash products as a result of increases in demand ebu operating income for 2015 improved as compared to 2014 primarily due to the higher sales volumes

trade nonvolatile memory includes nand flash and 3d xpoint memory nontrade nonvolatile memory primarily consists of nonvolatile memory products manufactured and sold to intel through imft at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost information regarding our mcp products which combine both nand flash and dram components is reported within trade nonvolatile memory sales of nor flash products are included in other 

dram 



the increase in gigabits sold and decrease in cost per gigabit for 2016 and 2015 as compared to prior years were primarily due to increases in gigabit production as a result of improvements in product and process technologies lower costs for products purchased from inotera contributed to manufacturing cost reductions for 2016 and 2015 gigabit production and cost reductions for 2016 and 2015 were constrained by equipment downtime incurred in connection with transitioning from 25nm to 20nmbased products and a shift to a higher mix of ddr4 products which have larger die sizes and fewer bits per wafer 

our gross margin percentage for 2016 declined as compared to 2015 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2015 improved from 2014 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices 

trade nonvolatile memory 



through 2016 substantially all of our trade nonvolatile memory sales were from nand flash products the increase in gigabits sold of trade nonvolatile memory for 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to increases in gigabit production due to improvements in product and process technology increases in gigabit production for 2016 were constrained by equipment downtime incurred in connection with transitioning to 3d nand flash products the increase in gigabits sold of trade nonvolatile memory for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to higher production from improved product and process technologies and the transition of our wafer fabrication facility in singapore from dram to nand flash production increases in gigabit production for 2015 as compared to 2014 were limited by a shift in product mix to higher levels of managed nand flash and mcp products which have both higher average selling prices and costs per gigabit 

our gross margin percentage on sales of trade nonvolatile memory products for 2016 declined from 2015 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions our gross margin percentage on sales of trade nonvolatile memory products for 2015 declined from 2014 as the decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions 

operating expenses and other 

selling general and administrative 

sga expenses for 2016 decreased 8 as compared to 2015 due to decreases in payroll costs resulting primarily from the suspension of variablepay plans decreases in travel costs and an additional week in 2015 

 34 

sga expenses for 2015 increased 2 as compared to 2014 primarily due to an additional week in 2015 and higher legal costs 

research and development 

rd expenses for 2016 increased 5 from 2015 primarily due to higher volumes of development wafers processed higher payroll costs and an increase in depreciation expense from rd capital expenditures 

rd expenses for 2015 increased 12 from 2014 primarily due to a higher volume of development wafers processed an increase in depreciation expense due to rd capital expenditures higher payroll costs higher subcontracted engineering and other professional service costs and an additional week in 2015 increases in rd expenses for 2015 as compared to 2014 were partly attributable to increased spending on controllers firmware and engineering to support systemlevel products including ssd managed nand flash and hmc products 

we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand flash and 3d xpoint memory our rd expenses reflect net reductions as a result of reimbursements under our costsharing arrangements with intel and others of 208 million 231 million and 162 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

see further discussion of our rd in part i – item 1 – business – research and development 

restructure and asset impairments 

in the fourth quarter of 2016 we initiated a restructure plan in response to the current business environment and the need to accelerate focus on our key priorities in which we expect to save as compared to our previously planned spending levels approximately 80 million  per quarter in 2017 the savings are expected to result from a combination of a more focused set of projects and programs the permanent closure of a number of open headcount requisitions workforce reductions in certain areas of the business and other nonheadcount related spending reductions see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – restructure and asset impairments 

income taxes 

our effective tax rates were 68 60 and 47 for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively primarily reflecting provisions on nonus operations our effective tax rates reflect the following 

 

income taxes for 2016 2015 and 2014 included 114 million 80 million and 59 million respectively related to utilization of and other changes in deferred tax assets of mmj and mmt income taxes for 2016 also included tax benefits of 58 million related to the favorable resolution of certain prior year tax matters which were previously reserved as uncertain tax positions and 41 million related to a us valuation allowance release resulting from the acquisition of tidal systems ltd the remaining tax provision for 2016 2015 and 2014 primarily reflects taxes on our other nonus operations income taxes on us operations for 2016 2015 and 2014 were substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowance 

we have a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset associated with our us operations management continues to evaluate future projected financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support a reduction in or reversal of the valuation allowance the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if sufficient positive evidence exists 

we operate in a number of locations outside the us including singapore and to a lesser extent taiwan where we have tax incentive arrangements that are conditional in part upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds the benefit of tax incentive arrangements which expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2030 was not material to our tax provision for 2016 and reduced our tax provision for 2015  and 2014  by 338 million  benefitting our diluted earnings per share by 029  and 286 million   024  per diluted share respectively

equity in net income loss of equity method investees 

we recognize our share of earnings or losses from equity method investments generally on a twomonth lag equity in net income loss of equity method investees net of tax included the following 



our equity in net income loss of inotera declined for 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to declines in average selling prices and cost of transitioning to the next technology node included in our earnings for 2015 was 49 million from inoteras full release of its valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets related to its net operating loss carryforward and the resulting tax provision in subsequent periods 

in 2016 and 2015 we recorded an impairment charge of 25 million  and 10 million  respectively within equity in net income loss of equity method investees to write down the carrying value of our investment in tera probe to its fair value based on its trading price

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products which can vary significantly from period to period we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures and ongoing operations we expect from time to time in the future to engage in a variety of transactions for such purposes including the issuance or incurrence of secured and unsecured debt and the refinancing and restructuring of existing debt as of september 1 2016  we had a revolving credit facility available for up to 488 million  of additional financing based on eligible receivables we expect that our cash and investments cash flows from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months 

to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and equipment and rd we estimate that net cash expenditures in 2017 for property plant and equipment will be approximately 48 billion to 52 billion which reflects the offset of amounts we expect to be funded by our partners the actual amounts for 2017 will vary depending on market conditions total additions to property plant and equipment in 2016 were 701 billion  which in comparison to cash expenditures reflects differences in timing of receipts and payments for equipment as well as noncash additions such as equipment leases as of september 1 2016  we had commitments of approximately 780 million  for the acquisition of property plant and equipment substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year

our investments consist primarily of liquid investmentgrade fixedincome securities diversified among industries and individual issuers as of september 1 2016  132 billion of our cash and equivalents and shortterm investments was held by foreign subsidiaries primarily denominated in the us dollar to mitigate credit risk we invest through highcreditquality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor 

proposed acquisition of inotera 

in the second quarter of 2016 we entered into agreements to acquire the remaining interest in inotera for 30 new taiwan dollars per share in cash equivalent to approximately 095 per share assuming 317 new taiwan dollars per us dollar the exchange rate as of september 1 2016 based on the exchange rate as of september 1 2016 we estimate the aggregate consideration payable for the 67 of inotera shares not owned by us would be approximately 41 billion  

acquisition financing     on october 11 2016 we and inotera as coborrowers entered into a singledraw term loan facility the term loan facility from which proceeds will be used to pay a portion of the acquisition consideration and any related transaction costs and to provide working capital for inotera in the second and third quarters of 2016 we entered into agreements with nanya pursuant to which we have the option to issue a combination of shares of our common stock the micron shares and 200 convertible senior notes due 2021 the 2021 convertible notes to nanya which is subject to regulatory approvals and various other conditions 

  

term loan facility  the term loan facility can be made in a single draw on or prior to july 10 2017 subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions up to a maximum aggregate borrowing amount of 80 billion new taiwan dollars in cash equivalent to 25 billion the loan will bear interest at a variable rate equal to the threemonth or sixmonth taibor at our or inoteras option plus a margin of 205 per annum payable monthly in arrears the loan will mature five years from the date it is made and principal is payable in six equal semiannual installments commencing thirty months after such loan is made 

the term loan facility will be collateralized by certain assets including a real estate mortgage on inoteras main production facility and site a chattel mortgage over certain equipment of inotera all of the stock of our mstw subsidiary and the approximately 80 of the stock of inotera held by mstw following the consummation of the acquisition micron will guarantee all of inoteras and mstws obligations under the term loan facility 

the term loan facility contains affirmative and negative covenants which are customary for financings of this type including covenants that limit or restrict the ability to create liens in or dispose of collateral securing obligations under the term loan facility mergers involving mstw andor inotera loans or guarantees to third parties by inotera andor mstw and mstws distribution of cash dividends subject to satisfaction of certain financial conditions the term loan facility also contains financial covenants as follows which are tested semiannually 

 

if one or more of the required financial ratios is not maintained at the time the ratios are tested the interest rate will be increased by 025 until such time as the required financial ratios are maintained in addition if mstw fails to maintain a required financial ratio for two consecutive semiannual periods such failure will constitute an event of default that could result in all obligations owed under the term loan agreement being accelerated to be immediately due and payable our failure to maintain a required consolidated financial ratio will only result in an increase to the applicable interest rate and will not constitute an event of default under the term loan facility the term loan facility also contains customary events of default 

 37 

micron shares  we have the option to issue micron shares in an amount up to 315 billion  new taiwan dollars equivalent to 991 million  the private placement which would be used to fund a portion of the acquisition consideration the pershare selling price for the micron shares would be equal to the greater of the new taiwan dollar equivalent of i the average of the closing sale price of our common stock during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on and including the 30 th  calendar day prior to the consummation of the inotera acquisition or ii 1000  

2021 convertible notes  we have the option to issue 126 billion  new taiwan dollars equivalent to 396 million  in 2021 convertible notes in lieu of a corresponding value of micron shares so long as we also issue micron shares to nanya of at least 63 billion  new taiwan dollars equivalent to 198 million  pursuant to the private placement

contractual obligations 



 4   purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria 1 they are noncancelable 2 we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled or 3 we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services takeorpay if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable the entire value of the contract was included in the above table if the obligation is cancelable but we would incur a penalty if canceled the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation contracted minimum amounts specified in takeorpay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment 

5   amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other longterm liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet including 349 million for the current portion of these longterm liabilities we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future certain payments related to uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities therefore the amount has been excluded from the preceding table however other noncurrent liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet included these uncertain tax positions and deferred tax liabilities 

the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services market prices changes to agreedupon amounts or timing of certain events for some obligations the contractual obligations in the table above include the current portions of the related longterm obligations all other current liabilities are excluded

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into capped calls which are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution from our convertible notes the capped calls provide for our receipt of cash or shares at our election from our counterparties if the trading price of our stock is above a specified initial strike price at the expiration dates the amounts receivable vary based on the trading price of our stock up to specified cap prices the dollar value of the cash or shares that we would receive from the capped calls on their expiration dates ranges from 0 if the trading price of our stock is below the initial strike price for all of the capped calls to 719 million  if the trading price of our stock is at or above the cap price for all of the capped calls we paid 103 million  in 2012 and 48 million  in 2013 to purchase capped calls the amounts paid were recorded as charges to additional capital for further details of our capped call arrangements see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – equity – micron shareholders equity – outstanding capped calls 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

business acquisitions  accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values the items involving the most significant assumptions estimates and judgments include the following 

 

consolidations  we have interests in entities that are vies determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing whether an entity is a vie and if we are the entitys primary beneficiary if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we are required to consolidate it to determine if we are the primary beneficiary we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessments of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies require significant assumptions and judgments 

contingencies  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of a loss if any from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date in accounting for the resolution of contingencies considerable judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods 

 41 

goodwill and intangible assets    we test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of an impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill is less than its carrying value for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value then goodwill is tested for impairment using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires valuation of all of the reporting units tangible and intangible assets and liabilities if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value 

determining when to test for impairment the reporting units the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates forecasted manufacturing costs and other expenses and are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process the same estimates are used in business planning forecasting and capital budgeting as part of our longterm manufacturing capacity analysis we test the reasonableness of the output of our longrange planning process by calculating an implied value per share and comparing that to current stock prices analysts consensus pricing and managements expectations these estimates and assumptions are used to calculate projected future cash flows for the reporting unit which are discounted using a riskadjusted rate to calculate a fair value the discount rate requires determination of appropriate market comparables we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates 

we test other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset we test intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows estimating fair values involves significant assumptions especially regarding future sales prices sales volumes costs and discount rates 

income taxes  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in recent periods our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and taiwan our income tax provision or benefit is dependent in part on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve numerous judgments including among others projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes manufacturing and overhead costs levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value cost includes depreciation labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining net realizable value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting future average selling prices sales volumes and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated net realizable value below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our memory inventory by approximately 234 million as of september 1 2016 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

 42 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories in determining the lower of average cost or net realizable value inventories are primarily categorized as memory including dram nonvolatile and other memory based on the major characteristics of product type and markets the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 

property plant and equipment  we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

we periodically assess the estimated useful lives of our property plant and equipment we revised the estimated useful lives of equipment in our dram wafer fabrication facilities from five to seven years in the fourth quarter of 2016 for 2016 the effect of the revision was not material see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – significant accounting policies 

research and development  costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are included in cost of goods sold 

stockbased compensation    stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgment 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio a substantial portion of our indebtedness is at fixed interest rates as a result the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates we estimate that as of september 1 2016  and september 3 2015  a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates of 1 would increase the fair value of our notes payable by approximately 420 million and 366 million respectively a 1 increase in the interest rates of our variablerate debt would result in an increase in interest expense of approximately 10 million per year 

as of september 1 2016  and september 3 2015  we held fixedrate debt securities of 111 billion and 383 billion respectively that were subject to interest rate risk we estimate that a 05 increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of these instruments by approximately 1 million as of september 1 2016  and 13 million as of september 3 2015  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in part i – item 1a risk factors changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the functional currency for us and all of our consolidated subsidiaries is the us dollar the substantial majority of our sales are transacted in the us dollar however significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro singapore dollar new taiwan dollar and yen we have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs which reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

based on our foreign currency balances from monetary assets and liabilities we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 241 million  as of september 1 2016  and 134 million  as of september 3 2015  we hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities by utilizing a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast our monetary assets and liabilities to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – derivative instruments 

in the second quarter of 2016 we entered into agreements to acquire the remaining interest in inotera based on the exchange rate as of september 1 2016  we estimate the aggregate consideration payable would be approximately 41 billion  this payment is contingent upon the closing of the transaction and are therefore not recorded on our balance sheet as of september 1 2016  changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the new taiwan dollar could have a significant impact on our financial statements if the transactions are consummated see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – proposed acquisition of inotera

manufacturing 

our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china japan malaysia singapore and taiwan our inotera joint venture has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment dram nand flash and nor flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines in 2015 we began construction of a significant expansion of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore for production of nand flash memory 

our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment we continuously enhance our production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in 2015 the majority of our dram production was manufactured on our 25nm linewidth process technologies we expect that by the second half of 2016 the majority of our dram production will be manufactured on our 20nm linewidth process technology in 2015 a majority of our nand flash production was manufactured on our 20nm and 16nm linewidth process technology we began production of 3d nand flash products in 2015 and expect that in 2016 the majority of our nand flash production will be manufactured using 16nm linewidth process technology or 3d nand technology 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process perform high temperature burnin on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition we use our proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie bare die forms our packaged products include memory modules ssds mcps managed nand memory cards usb devices and hmcs we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment we contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing companies to manufacture nand flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices 

in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 

 5 

availability of raw materials 

our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability and increase the cost of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we andor our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

marketing and customers 

our products are sold into compute and graphics mobile ssd and other storage automotive industrial medical and other embedded and server markets market concentrations from 2015  net sales were approximately as follows 25  for compute and graphics including desktop pcs notebooks and workstations 25  for mobile 20  for ssd and other storage 15  for server and 10  for automotive industrial medical and other embedded sales to kingston primarily dram were 11  of our net sales in 2015  and 10 of our net sales in 2014  sales to intel primarily nand flash products through imft were 8  of our net sales in 2015  8  of our net sales in 2014  and 10  of our net sales in 2013  sales to hp primarily dram were 7  of our net sales in 2015  9  of our net sales in 2014  and 10  of our net sales in 2013  

our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron ®  lexar crucial ®  spectek ®  and elpida ®  brand names and private labels we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world we sell lexarbranded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several months 

backlog 

because of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

product warranty 

because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery under our general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions 

 6 

competition 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation sk hynix inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices many of our highvolume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors for these highvolume memory products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factors for our other memory products the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence over pricing 

research and development 

our process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies as well as new fundamentally different memory structures materials and packages which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram and lpdram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including 3d nand and mlc and tlc technologies 3d xpoint memory nor flash memory specialty memory ssds  hmcs and other memory technologies and systems 

our rd expenses were 154 billion  137 billion and 931 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand flash memory and 3d xpoint memory our rd expenses reflect net reductions of 231 million 162 million and 176 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of reimbursements under our intel and other costsharing arrangements 

to compete in the semiconductor memory industry we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions our process design and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world with our largest rd center located in boise idaho and other significant rd centers in japan china and other sites in the us in addition we develop photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boise 

rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 

geographic information 

sales to customers outside the united states totaled 1363 billion for 2015 and included sales of 666 billion in china 224 billion in taiwan 125 billion in europe 103 billion in japan and 204 billion in the rest of the asia pacific region excluding china japan and taiwan sales to customers outside the united states totaled 1381 billion for 2014 and 756 billion for 2013 as of september 3 2015 we had net property plant and equipment of 364 billion in the united states 324 billion in singapore 217 billion in japan 107 billion in taiwan 331 million in china and 96 million in other countries see part ii – item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – geographic information and item 1a risk factors 

 7 

patents and licenses 

in recent years we have been recognized as a leader in per capita and quality of patents issued as of september 3 2015  we owned approximately 16800 us patents and 4200 foreign patents in addition we have thousands of us and foreign patent applications pending our patents have various terms expiring through 2034 

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have from time to time licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties some of these license agreements require us to make onetime or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

employees 

as of september 3 2015  we had approximately 31800 employees 

environmental compliance 

government regulations impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges emissions and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes in 2015 our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of iso 14001 certification to continue certification we must meet annual requirements in environmental policy compliance planning management structure and responsibility training communication document control operational control emergency preparedness and response record keeping and management review while we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures modification of our operations or other compliance actions 

directors and executive officers of the registrant 

our executive officers are appointed annually by the board of directors and our directors are elected annually by our shareholders any directors appointed by the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board serve until the next election by the shareholders all officers and directors serve until their successors are duly chosen or elected and qualified except in the case of earlier death resignation or removal

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of us 

we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business 

if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in previous years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future in some prior periods average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future 



we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins 

our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes and product designs including but not limited to process linewidth architecture number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and yield in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes difficulty in transitioning to smaller linewidth process technologies technological barriers and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products 

the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including intel samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation sk hynix inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology capitalize on growth opportunities and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments such as china have provided and may continue to provide significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs transitions to smaller linewidth process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply in recent periods we and some of our competitors have begun construction on or announced plans to build new fabrication facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 11 

debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition 

in recent periods our debt levels have increased due to the capital intensive nature of our business business acquisitions and restructuring of our capital structure as of september 3 2015  we had debt with a carrying value of 734 billion  in addition the conversion value in excess of principal amount for our convertible notes outstanding as of september 3 2015  was 553 million  in 2015 we paid 143 billion to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of 489 million in 2014 we paid 230 billion to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of 109 billion as of september 3 2015  we had 1 revolving credit facilities available that provide for up to 842 million  of additional financing and 2 a term loan agreement available to obtain financing collateralized by certain property plant and equipment in the amount of 690 billion new taiwan dollars or an equivalent amount in us dollars approximately 213 million as of september 3 2015  of which we drew 40 million in 2015 the availability of these revolving and other facilities is subject to certain conditions including outstanding balances of trade receivables inventories collateralization of certain property plant and equipment and other conditions events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy these applicable drawdown conditions and utilize these facilities we have in the past and expect in the future to continue to incur additional debt to finance our capital investments business acquisitions and restructuring of our capital structure 

our debt obligations could adversely impact us for example these obligations could 

 

our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flows in the future this to some extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rd and product and process technology we estimate that cash expenditures in 2016 for property plant and equipment will be approximately 53 billion to 58 billion investments in capital expenditures for 2015 were 412 billion in addition as a result of the mmj acquisition and our capacity expansion in singapore we expect our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels as of september 3 2015  we had cash and marketable investments of 563 billion  which included 748 million  held by the mmj group and 134 million  held by imft none of which is generally available to finance our other operations 

 12 

as a result of the japan proceedings for so long as such proceedings are continuing the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies installment payments these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the mmj companies as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court as a result the assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries while available to satisfy the mmj companies installment payments and the other obligations capital expenditures and other operating needs of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are not available for use by us in our other operations furthermore certain uses of the assets of the mmj group including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt may require consent of mmjs trustees andor the japan court 

in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our debt levels expected debt amortization and general economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditions 

the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda 

on january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimonda insolvency proceedings filed suit against micron and micron semiconductor bv our netherlands subsidiary micron bv in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron bv and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron bv purchased substantially all of qimondas shares of inotera memories inc the inotera shares representing approximately 55 of our total shares in inotera as of september 3 2015  and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks among other things to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent crosslicense between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement 

following a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate on march 13 2014 the court issued judgments 1 ordering micron bv to pay approximately 1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase 2 ordering micron bv to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties 3 ordering micron bv to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares including in particular any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits 4 denying qimonda’s claims against micron for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera and 5 determining that qimondas obligations under the patent crosslicense agreement are canceled in addition the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering among other things 1 that micron bv transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by it and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties and 2 that micron bv pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares the interlocutory judgments have no immediate enforceable effect on us and accordingly we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case we have filed a notice of appeal and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court the next hearing on the matter has not yet been scheduled 

we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or monetary damages unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron bv from the ownership of the inotera shares andor the termination of the patent crosslicense which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as of september 3 2015  the inotera shares had a carrying value for purposes of our financial reporting of 683 million and a market value of 846 million 

 13 

our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies 

our key semiconductor memory technologies of dram nand flash and nor flash face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability to meet these requirements we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance andor cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies    there can be no assurance of the following 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we announced the development of new 3d xpoint technology which is an entirely new class of nonvolatile memory there is no assurance that our efforts to develop and market this new product technology will be successful if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

new product development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products including systemlevel memory products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop dram nand flash nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance of the following 

• that our product development efforts will be successful 

• that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products 

• that we will be able to successfully market these products or 

• that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 

if our efforts to develop new products are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

products that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

 

 14 

a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see part ii financial information – item 8 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – contingencies 

we have a number of intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks 

we have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these relationships include our imft joint venture with intel our inotera joint venture with nanya and our mp mask joint venture with photronics these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the following 

 

if our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

if our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the us singapore taiwan japan malaysia and china additionally our control over operations at imft inotera mp mask and tera probe is limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment equipment failures earthquakes or other environmental events if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships any of which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 15 

the operations of the mmj companies are subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings 

because the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj the japan proceedings are continuing and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the japan proceedings the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition 

during the pendency of the japan proceedings the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively integrate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companies 

our inotera supply agreements involves numerous risks 

since january 2013 we have purchased all of inoteras dram output at a price reflecting a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement in the second quarter of 2015 we executed a supply agreement to be effective beginning on january 1 2016 the 2016 supply agreement which will replace the current agreement under the 2016 supply agreement the price for dram products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us the 2016 supply agreement has an initial twoyear term followed by a threeyear winddown period and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a twoyear extension and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive oneyear extensions upon termination of the initial twoyear term of the 2016 supply agreement or any extensions we would purchase dram from inotera during the winddown period our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period our inotera supply agreements involve numerous risks including the following 

 

in 2015 and in 2014 our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to the pricing formula of the current agreement and strong market conditions for 2015 we purchased 237 billion  of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 35 of our aggregate dram gigabit production if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 16 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

across our global operations there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the british pound euro shekel singapore dollar new taiwan dollar yen and yuan we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 27 million for 2015 28 million for 2014 and 229 million for 2013 based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities offset by balance sheet hedges we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 3 million  as of september 3 2015  in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies exchange rates for some of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the yen have been volatile in recent periods if these currencies strengthen against the us dollar our manufacturing costs could significantly increase in the event that exchange rates for the us dollar adversely change against our foreign currency exposures our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we may make future acquisitions andor alliances which involve numerous risks 

acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 

 

in previous years supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram nand flash and nor flash products resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants including the liquidation of qimonda and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida now known as mmj these types of proceedings often lead to courtdirected processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

breaches of our network security could expose us to losses 

we manage and store on our network systems various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations we also process store and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees including sensitive personal information unauthorized users may be able to gain access to our network system and steal proprietary information compromise confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers and could expose us to litigation if the confidential information of our customers suppliers or employees is compromised 

 17 

compliance with regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act and its implementing securities and exchange commission regulations the doddfrank act imposes supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo the drc and finance or benefit local armed groups these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier or reduce purchases from us if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict free 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

we operate in a number of locations outside the us including in singapore and to a lesser extent taiwan where we have tax incentive agreements that are in part conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the distribution of our earnings among these different jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including challenges by tax authorities to our tax structure income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities failure to meet performance obligations with respect to tax incentive agreements and changes in tax laws and regulations we file income tax returns with the us federal government various us states and various other jurisdictions throughout the world our us federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2011 through 2015 in addition tax returns open to examination in multiple other taxing jurisdictions range from the years 2007 to 2015 the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

we may not utilize all of our net deferred tax assets 

we have substantial deferred tax assets which include among others net operating loss and credit carryforwards as of september 3 2015  our us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards including uncertain tax benefits were 402 billion  and 205 billion  respectively which if not utilized will expire at various dates from 2016 through 2035 as of september 3 2015  our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were 515 billion including 381 billion  pertaining to japan which if not utilized substantially all will expire at various dates from 2017 through 2025 as of september 3 2015  we had valuation allowances of 116 billion  and 710 million  against our net deferred tax assets in the us and japan respectively 

the limited availability of raw materials supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations require raw materials and in certain cases third party services that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as silicon wafers controllers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we andor our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials or services is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 18 

our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the suppliers limited capacity our inability to obtain this equipment timely could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp if we are unable to obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment in a timely manner our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business 

downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers mobile devices solidstate drives and servers reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate 

we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster fire explosion or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

sales to customers outside the united states approximated 84 of our consolidated net sales for 2015 in addition a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states in particular a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore taiwan and japan our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

these factors may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 19 

we are subject to counterparty default risks 

we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash deposits investments cappedcall contracts on our stock and derivative instruments as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding in the event of such default we could incur significant losses which could adversely impact our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 3 legal proceedings 

reorganization proceedings of the mmj companies 

on july 31 2013 we completed the acquisition of elpida now known as mmj a japanese corporation pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement on support for reorganization companies as amended the sponsor agreement that we entered into on july 2 2012 with the trustees of the mmj companies pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan 

the mmj companies filed petitions for commencement of corporate reorganization proceedings with the japan court under the corporate reorganization act of japan on february 27 2012 and the japan court issued an order to commence the reorganization proceedings the japan proceedings on march 23 2012 on july 2 2012 we entered into the sponsor agreement with the legal trustees of the mmj companies and the japan court approved the sponsor agreement under the sponsor agreement we agreed to provide certain support for the reorganization of the mmj companies and the trustees agreed to prepare and seek approval from the japan court and the mmj companies creditors of plans of reorganization consistent with such support 

the trustees initially submitted the proposed plans of reorganization for the mmj companies to the japan court on august 21 2012 and submitted final proposed plans on october 29 2012 on october 31 2012 the japan court approved submission of the trustees proposed plans of reorganization to creditors for approval on february 26 2013 the mmj companies creditors approved the reorganization plans and on february 28 2013 the japan court issued an order approving the plans of reorganization appeals filed by certain creditors of mmj in japan challenging the plan approval order issued by the japan court were denied 

in a related action mmj filed a verified petition for recognition and chapter 15 relief in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the us court on march 19 2012 and on april 24 2012 the us court entered an order that among other things recognized mmjs corporate reorganization proceeding as a foreign main proceeding pursuant to 11 usc § 1517b on june 25 2013 the us court issued a recognition order which recognized the order of the japan court approving mmjs plan of reorganization on november 19 2013 the us court closed the us chapter 15 proceeding 

the plans of reorganization provide for payments by the mmj companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items the plans of reorganization also provided for the investment by us pursuant to the sponsor agreement of 60 billion yen 615 million paid at closing in cash into mmj in exchange for 100 ownership of mmjs equity and the use of such investment to fund the initial installment payment by the mmj companies to their creditors of 60 billion yen subject to reduction for certain items specified in the sponsor agreement and plans of reorganization 

under mmjs plan of reorganization secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their fixed claims and unsecured creditors will recover at least 174 of the amount of their fixed claims the actual recovery of unsecured creditors will be higher however based in part on events and circumstances occurring following the plan approval the remaining portion of the unsecured claims will be discharged without payment over the period that payments are made pursuant to the plans of reorganization the secured creditors will be paid in full on or before the sixth installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments mais plan of reorganization provides that secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their claims whereas unsecured creditors will recover 19 of the amount of their claims the secured creditors of mai were paid in full on the first installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments 

 21 

because the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of the mmj acquisition the japan proceedings are continuing and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the reorganization proceedings the business trustee makes decisions in relation to the operation of the businesses of the mmj companies other than decisions in relation to acts that need to be carried out in connection with the japan proceedings which are the responsibility of the legal trustee the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court will continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date the mmj companies may petition the japan court for an early termination of the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made although such early terminations are customarily granted there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition in these particular cases 

during the pendency of the japan proceedings the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling material disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively integrate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companies

acquisition of micron memory japan inc 

on july 31 2013 we completed the mmj acquisition in which we acquired elpida now known as mmj and a controlling interest in rexchip now known as mmt in 2014 we purchased additional interests in mmt increasing our ownership interest to 995 in connection with the mmj acquisition we recorded net assets of 260 billion noncontrolling interests of 168 million and a gain on the transaction of 148 billion in 2013 in the second quarter of 2014 the provisional amounts recorded in connection with the mmj acquisition were adjusted primarily for prepetition liabilities as a result other nonoperating expense for 2014 included these measurement period adjustments of 33 million see item 8 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – micron memory japan inc 

the mmj acquisition included a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in hiroshima japan a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility in taichung city taiwan and an assembly and test facility located in akita japan these wafer fabrication facilities together represented approximately 30 of our total wafer capacity for 2015 the mmj groups products include mobile dram targeted to mobile phones and tablets and computing dram targeted to desktop pcs servers notebooks and workstations the operations from the mmj acquisition are included primarily in the mbu and cnbu segments

net sales 



percentages reflect rounding and may not total 100 

total net sales for 2015 decreased 1 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lower cnbu sales as a result of decreases in dram sales as declines in average selling prices outpaced increases in gigabit sales volumes sbu and mbu sales for 2015 increased as compared to 2014 as a result of higher nand flash sales due to increases in gigabit sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices ebu sales for 2015 increased as compared to 2014 due to higher sales volumes as a result of increases in market demand the increases in gigabit sales volumes for 2015 were primarily attributable to higher manufacturing output due to improvements in product and process technologies 

total net sales for 2014 increased 80 as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher cnbu and mbu sales resulting from the mmj acquisition net sales for all segments in 2014 also benefitted as compared to 2013 from increases in dram and nand flash sales volumes driven primarily by higher manufacturing output as a result of improvements in product and process technology and an increased share of output from inotera 

gross margin 

our overall gross margin percentage declined to 32 for 2015 from 33 for 2014 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by manufacturing cost reductions cnbu and sbu experienced declines in gross margin percentage for 2015 as compared to 2014 as declines in average selling price outpaced manufacturing cost reductions mbus gross margin percentage for 2015 improved as compared to 2014 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices 

since january 2013 we have purchased all of inoteras dram output at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement in the second quarter of 2015 we executed a supply agreement to be effective beginning on january 1 2016 the 2016 supply agreement which will replace the current agreement under the 2016 supply agreement the price for dram products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us the 2016 supply agreement has an initial twoyear term followed by a threeyear winddown period and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a twoyear extension and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive oneyear extensions upon termination of the initial twoyear term of the 2016 supply agreement or any extensions we would purchase dram from inotera during the winddown period our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period in 2015 and 2014 our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to the pricing formula of the current agreement and strong market conditions under the market conditions prevailing in the fourth quarter of 2015 costs of products purchased under the current agreement were higher than they would have been under the pricing formula of the 2016 supply agreement we purchased 237 billion  268 billion  and 126 billion  of dram products from inotera in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

our overall gross margin percentage improved to 33 for 2014 from 20 for 2013 primarily due to improvements in the gross margin percentage for cnbu and mbu as a result of higher margins for dram products the gross margin improvements for cnbu and mbu for 2014 as compared to 2013 resulted primarily from the mmj acquisition manufacturing cost reductions and higher average selling prices for cnbu our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to reductions in costs and increases in average selling prices cost reductions for 2014 primarily reflected improvements in product and process technologies and the comparatively lower manufacturing costs of the mmj group partially offset by higher costs for product obtained under the inotera supply agreement for 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013 our costs of goods sold for dram products included the sale of the mmj groups inventories recorded at fair value in the mmj acquisition which was higher than the manufacturing cost of such inventories this increased our costs of goods sold by approximately 153 million for 2014 and 41 million for 2013

operating results by business segments 

cnbu 



cnbu sales and operating results are significantly impacted by average selling prices gigabit sales volumes and cost per gigabit of our dram products see operating results by product – dram for further detail cnbu sales for 2015 decreased 8 as compared to 2014 primarily due to declines in average selling prices as a result of continued weakness in the pc sector partially offset by increases in gigabits sold cnbu operating income for 2015 declined from 2014 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions 

cnbu sales for 2014 increased 112 as compared to 2013 primarily due to 1 the mmj acquisition 2 higher average selling prices 3 increased dram supply from inotera as a result of the restructuring of our supply agreement and 4 higher output due to improvements in product and process technologies cnbu sales for 2014 as compared to 2013 were adversely impacted by the transition of production at one of our singapore wafer fabrication facilities from dram to nand flash cnbu operating income for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to the mmj acquisition higher average selling prices and manufacturing cost reductions 

mbu 



in 2015 and 2014 mbu sales were comprised primarily of dram nand flash and nor flash in decreasing order of revenue with mobile dram products accounting for a significant majority of the sales mbu sales for 2015 increased 2 as compared to 2014 primarily due to significant increases in gigabit sales volumes for managed nand flash and mcp products partially offset by lower sales of mobile dram products as a result of declines in average selling prices and sales volumes mbu operating income for 2015 improved from 2014 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices 

  mbu sales for 2014 increased 199 as compared to 2013 primarily due to significant increases in mobile dram sales as a result of the mmj acquisition mbu operating margin for 2014 also improved from 2013 primarily due to the mmj acquisition and manufacturing cost reductions which significantly outpaced declines in average selling prices 

sbu 



sbu sales and operating results are significantly impacted by average selling prices gigabit sales volumes and cost per gigabit of our nand flash products see operating results by product – nonvolatile memory for further details sbu sales for 2015 increased 6 from 2014 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices sbu sells a portion of its products to intel through our imft joint venture at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost sbu sales of products to intel under this arrangement were 420 million  423 million  and 387 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively all other sbu products are sold to oems resellers retailers and other customers including intel which we collectively refer to as trade customers 

 29 

sbu sales of nand flash products to trade customers for 2015 increased 7 as compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices increases in gigabits sold for 2015 as compared to 2014 were primarily due to higher manufacturing output sbu operating margin for 2015 declined from 2014 as decreases in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions and rd costs increased in connection with increased spending on controllers firmware and engineering for ssds and managed nand flash products 

sbu sales for 2014 increased 23 from 2013 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices increases in gigabits sold for 2014 were primarily due to the transition in 2014 of production at one of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore from dram to nand flash and improvements in product and process technologies sbu sales of nand flash products to trade customers for 2014 increased 26 as compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices sbu operating income for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to higher gigabit sales volumes as manufacturing cost reductions were essentially offset by declines in average selling prices 

ebu 



in 2015 and 2014 ebu sales were comprised of dram nand flash and nor flash in decreasing order of revenue ebu sales for 2015 increased 13 as compared to 2014 primarily due to higher sales volumes of dram and nand flash products as a result of increases in demand ebu operating income for 2015 improved as compared to 2014 primarily due to the higher sales volumes 

ebu sales for 2014 increased 39 as compared to 2013 primarily due to increased sales volumes of dram and nand flash products partially offset by declines in average selling prices ebu operating income for 2014 improved as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher margins on sales of dram and nand flash products as a result of the increase in sales and cost reductions 

operating results by product 

net sales by product 



percentages reflect rounding and may not total 100 

nonvolatile memory includes nand flash and 3d xpoint memory through 2015 substantially all of our nonvolatile memory sales were from nand flash products sales of nor flash products are included in other information regarding our mcp products which combine both nand flash and dram components is reported within nonvolatile memory 

dram 



 30 

the increase in gigabit sales volumes of dram products for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to increases in gigabit production despite our continued preparation of fabrication facilities for production of the next technology node which constrained output dram gigabit production growth in 2015 was also impacted by a shift to a higher mix of mobile and ddr4 products which have larger die sizes and therefore produce fewer bits per wafer the increase in gigabit sales of dram products for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher production volumes resulting from the mmj acquisition increased supply under the inotera supply agreement and improved product and process technologies partially offset by the transition of one of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore from dram to nand flash in 2014 dram products produced by facilities acquired in the mmj acquisition constituted 54 of our aggregate dram gigabit production as compared to 9 in 2013 

in 2015 and 2014 our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to the pricing formula of the current agreement and strong market conditions under the market conditions prevailing in the fourth quarter of 2015 costs of products purchased under the current agreement were higher than they would have been under the pricing formula of the 2016 supply agreement dram products acquired from inotera accounted for 35 of our aggregate dram gigabit production for 2015 as compared to 38 for 2014 and 54 for 2013 

our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2015 improved from 2014 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to reductions in costs and increases in average selling prices cost reductions for 2014 primarily reflected improvements in product and process technologies and the comparatively lower manufacturing costs of the mmj group partially offset by higher costs for product obtained under the inotera supply agreement and the sale of the mmj groups inventories recorded in the mmj acquisition 

nonvolatile memory 

the following discussion focuses on sales of nand flash products which constituted substantially all of nonvolatile memory sales through 2015 this discussion of nand flash excludes nand flash products manufactured and sold to intel through imft at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost 



the increase in nand flash gigabits sold to trade customers for 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to higher production from improved product and process technologies and the transition of our wafer fabrication facility in singapore from dram to nand flash production increases in gigabit production of nand flash products for 2015 as compared to 2014 were limited by a shift in product mix to higher levels of managed nand flash and mcp products which have both higher average selling prices and costs per gigabit increases in nand flash gigabits sold to trade customers for 2014 as compared to 2013 were primarily due to the transition of our wafer fabrication facility in singapore from dram to nand flash production and improvements in product and process technologies 

  our gross margin percentage on sales of trade nand flash products for 2015 declined from 2014 as the declines in average selling prices outpaced manufacturing cost reductions resulting from improvements in product and process technologies our gross margin percentage on sales of trade nand flash products for 2014 was relatively unchanged from 2013 as manufacturing cost reductions offset declines in average selling prices manufacturing cost reductions for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily resulted from improvements in product and process technologies 

 31 

operating expenses and other 

selling general and administrative 

sga expenses for 2015 increased 2 as compared to 2014 primarily due to an additional week in 2015 and higher legal costs 

sga expenses for 2014 increased 26 as compared to 2013 primarily due to the incremental costs resulting from the mmj acquisition and higher payroll costs resulting primarily from the reinstatement of variable pay plans 

research and development 

rd expenses for 2015 increased 12 from 2014 primarily due to a higher volume of development wafers processed an increase in depreciation expense due to rd capital expenditures higher payroll costs higher subcontracted engineering and other professional service costs and an additional week in 2015 increases in rd expenses for 2015 as compared to 2014 were partly attributable to increased spending on controllers firmware and engineering to support system level products including ssd managed nand flash and hmc products 

rd expenses for 2014 increased 47 from 2013 primarily due to the incremental costs resulting from the mmj acquisition higher payroll costs resulting primarily from the reinstatement of variable pay plans and increased resources dedicated to development efforts 

we generally share with intel the costs of product design and process development activities for nand flash memory and 3d xpoint memory our rd expenses reflect net reductions of 231 million 162 million and 176 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of reimbursements under our intel and other costsharing arrangements 

our process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram mobile lpdram products high density nand flash memory including 3d nand and mlc and tlc technologies 3d xpoint memory ssds hybrid memory cubes specialty memory nor flash memory and other memory technologies and systems 

restructure and asset impairments 



in order to optimize operations improve efficiency and increase our focus on our core memory operations we have entered into various restructure activities for 2014 and 2013 other restructure included charges associated with our efforts to wind down our 200mm operations primarily in agrate italy and kiryat gat israel and charges associated with workforce optimization activities primarily related to our mbu and ebu operating segments as of september 3 2015  we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional costs for these restructure activities see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – restructure and asset impairments 

interest income expense 

net interest expense for 2015  2014  and 2013 included aggregate amounts of amortization of debt discount and other costs of 138 million  167 million  and 122 million  respectively 

 32 

income taxes 

our effective tax rates were 60 47 and 06 for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively our effective tax rates reflect the following 

 

income taxes for 2015 and 2014 included 80 million and 59 million respectively related to changes in amounts of net deferred tax assets associated with the mmj group income taxes for 2013 included benefits of 19 million from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters and a change in tax laws applicable to prior years the remaining tax provision for 2015 2014 and 2013 primarily reflects taxes on our other nonus operations income taxes on us operations for 2015 2014 and 2013 were substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowance 

we have a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset associated with our us operations management continues to evaluate future projected financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support a reduction in or reversal of the valuation allowances the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if significant positive evidence increases 

we operate in a number of locations outside the us including singapore and to a lesser extent taiwan where we have tax incentive agreements that are conditional upon meeting certain business operations and employment thresholds the effect of tax incentive arrangements which expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2030 reduced our tax provision for 2015  2014  and 2013  by 338 million  benefitting our diluted earnings per share by 029  286 million   024  per diluted share and 141 million   013  per diluted share respectively 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – income taxes 

equity in net income loss of equity method investees 

we recognize our share of earnings or losses from equity method investments generally on a twomonth lag equity in net income loss of equity method investees net of tax included the following 



our share of earnings for 2015 included 49 million for the net effect of inoteras full release of its valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets related to its net operating loss carryforward and the resulting tax provision in subsequent periods as a result of the release inoteras future net income is subject to tax provisions our equity in net income of inotera declined for 2015 as compared to 2014 due to a decrease in inoteras operating results as a result of declines in average selling prices 

since january 2013 we have purchased all of inoteras dram output at prices reflecting a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement in the second quarter of 2015 we executed the 2016 supply agreement to be effective beginning on january 1 2016 which will replace the current agreement under the 2016 supply agreement the price for dram products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us in 2015 and in 2014 our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities due to the pricing formula of the current agreement and strong market conditions under the market conditions prevailing in the fourth quarter of 2015 costs of products purchased under the current agreement were higher than they would have been under the pricing formula of the 2016 supply agreement 

 33 

other operating and nonoperating 

in 2014 we settled all pending litigation between us and rambus including all antitrust and patent matters and entered into a patent crosslicense agreement as a result other operating expense for 2014 included a 233 million charge to accrue a liability which reflects the discounted value of amounts due under this arrangement 

other nonoperating expense for 2015 2014 and 2013 included losses from the restructure of our debt of 49 million  184 million  and 31 million  respectively see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – debt 

other nonoperating expense included losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 27 million  28 million  and 229 million  for 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the loss for 2013 included a 228 million loss for currency contracts to hedge our yendenominated obligations in connection with the mmj acquisition 

on august 15 2014 on semiconductor corporation acquired aptina for approximately 433 million  and we recognized a nonoperating gain of 119 million  on the sale of our shares based on our diluted ownership interest of approximately 27  

on may 15 2014 inotera issued 400 million  common shares in a public offering at a price equal to 3150  new taiwan dollars per share which was in excess of our carrying value per share as a result of the issuance our ownership interest decreased from 35 to 33  and we recognized a nonoperating gain of 93 million  in 2014 on may 28 2013 inotera issued 634 million common shares to nanya and certain of its affiliates in a private placement at a price equal to 947 new taiwan dollars per share which was in excess of our carrying value per share as a result of the issuance our ownership interest decreased from 40 to 35 and we recognized a nonoperating gain of 48 million in 2013 

further discussion of other operating and nonoperating income and expenses can be found in the following notes contained in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets we generated cash from operations of 521 billion  in 2015 and  570 billion  in 2014 cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products which can vary significantly from period to period we obtained 250 billion from debt and lease financing in 2015 and 223 billion in 2014 as of september 3 2015  we had 1 revolving credit facilities available that provide for up to 842 million  of additional financing based on eligible receivables and inventories and 2 a term loan agreement available to obtain financing collateralized by certain property plant and equipment in the amount of 690 billion  new taiwan dollars or an equivalent amount in us dollars approximately 213 million  as of september 3 2015  of which we drew 40 million  on june 18 2015 we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently funding capital expenditures dilutionmanagement activities including repurchases of convertible notes and our common stock and ongoing operations we expect from time to time in the future to engage in a variety of transactions for such purposes including the issuance or incurrence of secured and unsecured debt and the refinancing and restructuring of existing debt 

to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and equipment and rd as a result of the mmj acquisition and our expansion in singapore we expect our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels we estimate that cash expenditures in 2016 for property plant and equipment will be approximately 53 billion to 58 billion which includes amounts we expect to be funded by our partners the actual amounts for 2016 will vary depending on market conditions investments in capital expenditures for 2015 were 412 billion total additions to property plant and equipment were 446 billion  which in comparison to cash expenditures reflects differences in timing of receipts and payments for equipment as well as noncash additions such as equipment leases as of september 3 2015  we had commitments of approximately 162 billion  for the acquisition of property plant and equipment substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year 

 34 

in december 2014 we announced plans to add approximately 255000 square feet of clean room space to our fabrication facility in singapore this expansion facilitates efficient implementation of 3d nand flash production at the singapore facility and gives us the flexibility to gradually add incremental capacity in response to market requirements construction of the additional space began in 2015 with initial manufacturing output likely in 2017 subject to market conditions we estimate capital expenditures of approximately 193 billion in 2016 related to this facility 

since the first quarter of 2015 our board of directors has authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to 125 billion of our outstanding common stock 250 million of which was authorized in the first quarter of 2016 any repurchases under the authorization may be made in open market purchases block trades privatelynegotiated transactions andor derivative transactions repurchases are subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination of the best use of available cash during 2015 we repurchased 42 million  shares for 831 million  including commissions in the open market 

we expect that our cash and investments cash flows from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through the next 12 months 



as of september 3 2015  217 billion of our cash and equivalents and shortterm investments was held by foreign subsidiaries of which 149 million was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to mitigate credit risk we invest through highcreditquality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor 

limitations on the use of cash and investments 

mmj group  cash and equivalents and shortterm investments in the table above included an aggregate of 748 million held by the mmj group as of september 3 2015  as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings of the mmj companies entered into in march 2012 and for so long as such proceedings are continuing the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies installment payments these prohibitions also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustee and japan court as a result the assets of the mmj group are not available for use by us in our other operations moreover certain uses of the assets of the mmj group including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt may require consent of mmjs trustees andor the japan court 

imft   cash and equivalents and shortterm investments in the table above included 134 million  held by imft as of september 3 2015  our ability to access funds held by imft to finance our other operations is subject to agreement by intel and contractual limitations amounts held by imft are not anticipated to be available to finance our other operations 

 35 

indefinitely reinvested   as of september 3 2015  we had 148 billion of cash and equivalents and shortterm investments including substantially all of the amounts held by the mmj group that were held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the us would subject these funds to us federal income taxes determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries is not practicable 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 521 billion  for 2015 cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to net income generated by our operations adjusted for certain noncash items 

investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities was 623 billion  for 2015 which consisted primarily of cash expenditures of 402 billion  for property plant and equipment and 214 billion of net outflows for investments in availableforsale securities 

financing activities 

net cash used by financing activities was 718 million  for 2015 which included outflows of 233 billion  for repayments of debt including 932 million for the amount in excess of principal of our convertible notes 831 million  for the openmarket repurchases of 42 million  shares of our common stock and 95 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts cash outflows for financing activities in 2015 were partially offset by inflows of 200 billion in aggregate from the issuance of the 2023 notes 2024 notes and 2026 notes 291 million from the proceeds of saleleaseback transactions 125 million from draws on our revolving credit facilities and 87 million from term loans 

2015 debt activity 

throughout 2015 we reduced the dilutive effects of our convertible notes through conversions and repurchases as a result we eliminated convertible notes that were convertible into approximately 37 million shares of our common stock the following table summarized our debt restructure activities in 2015 



 

potential settlement obligations of convertible notes 

since the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 trading day period ended september 30 2015 exceeded 130 of the conversion price per share of our 2032 notes and 2033 notes holders of those notes have the right to convert their notes at any time through december 31 2015 for all of our convertible notes we have either 1 the requirement to pay cash for the principal amount and the option to pay either cash shares of our common stock or any combination thereof for any remaining conversion obligation or 2 the option to pay cash issue shares of common stock or any combination thereof for the aggregate amount due upon conversion 

 36 

the following table summarizes the potential settlements as of september 3 2015  that we could be required to make if all holders converted their 2032 notes and 2033 notes 



 

contractual obligations 



1  amounts include mmj creditor installment payments convertible notes and other notes any future redemptions repurchases or conversions of convertible debt could impact the amount and timing of our cash payments 

2  amounts include principal and interest 

3  amounts include contractually obligated minimum lease payments for operating leases having an initial noncancelable term in excess of one year 

4  amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other longterm liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet including 222 million for the current portion of these longterm liabilities we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities therefore 91 million in aggregate of longterm income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities has been excluded from the preceding table however other noncurrent liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet included these uncertain tax positions and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities 

the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services market prices changes to agreedupon amounts or timing of certain events for some obligations the contractual obligations in the table above include the current portions of the related longterm obligations all other current liabilities are excluded 

purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria 1 they are noncancelable 2 we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled or 3 we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services takeorpay if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable the entire value of the contract was included in the above table if the obligation is cancelable but we would incur a penalty if canceled the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation contracted minimum amounts specified in takeorpay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment 

 37 

inotera supply agreements    since january 2013 we have purchased all of inoteras dram output at prices reflecting discounts from market prices for our comparable components under a supply agreement in the second quarter of 2015 we executed the 2016 supply agreement to be effective beginning on january 1 2016 which will replace the current agreement under the 2016 supply agreement the price for dram products sold to us will be based on a formula that equally shares margin between inotera and us the 2016 supply agreement has an initial twoyear term followed by a threeyear winddown period and contemplates negotiations in late 2016 with respect to a twoyear extension and annual negotiations thereafter with respect to successive oneyear extensions upon termination of the initial twoyear term of the 2016 supply agreement or any extensions we would purchase dram from inotera during the winddown period our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period we purchased 237 billion  of dram products from inotera in 2015 under the current agreement the current agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity as quantities are based on qualified production output and pricing fluctuates as it is based on market prices therefore we did not include any amounts under the current agreement in the contractual obligations table above under the 2016 supply agreement payments are primarily based on fluctuating quantities and prices but a portion of the expected costs under the agreement meet the criteria of a minimum lease payment under an operating lease and are included in the table above 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into capped calls which are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution from our convertible notes the capped calls provide for our receipt of cash or shares at our election from our counterparties if the trading price of our stock is above a specified initial strike price at the expiration dates the amounts receivable varies based on the trading price of our stock up to specified cap prices the dollar value of the cash or shares that we would receive from the capped calls on their expiration dates ranges from 0 if the trading price of our stock is below the initial strike price for all of the capped calls to 814 million  if the trading price of our stock is at or above the cap price for all of the capped calls we paid 57 million  in 2011 103 million  in 2012 and 48 million  in 2013 to purchase capped calls the amounts paid were recorded as charges to additional capital for further details of our capped call arrangements see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – equity – micron shareholders equity – capped calls 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

business acquisitions  accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values the items involving the most significant assumptions estimates and judgments included determining the fair value of the following 

 

 38 

consolidations  we have interests in joint venture entities that are vies determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing whether an entity is a vie and if we are the entitys primary beneficiary to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we evaluate whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies requires significant assumptions and judgment 

contingencies  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date in accounting for the resolution of contingencies considerable judgment may be necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution that are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods 

income taxes  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in recent periods our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and taiwan our income tax provision or benefit is dependent in part on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve numerous judgments including among others projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes manufacturing and overhead costs levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value cost includes depreciation labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining net realizable value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting future average selling prices sales volumes and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated net realizable value below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated net realizable value of our memory inventory by approximately 195 million as of september 3 2015 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to net realizable values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories inventories are primarily categorized as memory including dram nonvolatile and other memory for purposes of determining lower of average cost or net realizable value the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 

property plant and equipment  we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

 39 

research and development  costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are valued in inventory 

stockbased compensation    stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgment 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio substantially all of our indebtedness is at fixed interest rates as a result the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates we estimate that as of september 3 2015  and august 28 2014 a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates of 1 would increase the fair value of our notes payable by approximately 366 million and 250 million respectively the increase in interest expense caused by a 1 increase in the interest rates of our variablerate debt would not be significant 

as of september 3 2015  and august 24 2014 we held debt securities of 383 billion and 165 billion respectively that were subject to interest rate risk we estimate that a 05 increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of these instruments by approximately 13 million as of september 3 2015  and 6 million as of august 28 2014 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the currency exchange rates in part i – item 1a risk factors changes in currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

 40 

the functional currency for all of our consolidated subsidiaries is the us dollar the substantial majority of our revenues are transacted in the us dollar however significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the british pound the euro the shekel the singapore dollar the new taiwan dollar the yen and the yuan we have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in the fair value and volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we utilize currency forward and option contracts in these hedging programs which reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

to hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities we utilize a rolling hedge strategy for our primary currency exposures with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities offset by balance sheet hedges we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 3 million  as of september 3 2015  and 7 million  as of august 28 2014  to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months

manufacturing 

our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china japan malaysia puerto rico singapore and taiwan our inotera joint venture has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment dram nand flash and nor flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines in 2014 we transitioned one of our singapore wafer fabrication facilities from production of dram to nand flash 

our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment we continuously enhance our production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in 2014 the majority of our dram production was manufactured on our 30nm linewidth process technology we expect that in 2015 that the majority of our dram production will be manufactured on our 25nm and 20nm linewidth process technologies in 2014 a majority of our nand flash memory production was manufactured on 20nm linewidth process technology we expect that in 2015 a majority of our nand flash production will be manufactured on our 16nm linewidth process technology we expect to begin sampling 3d nand flash products in the fourth quarter of calendar 2014 and to begin volume production in the second half of calendar 2015 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process perform high temperature burnin on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition we use our proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie bare die forms our packaged products include memory modules ssds mcps managed nand memory cards and usb devices we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment we contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing companies to manufacture nand flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices 

 5 

in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 

availability of raw materials 

our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we andor our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

marketing and customers 

our products are sold into compute and graphics mobile ssd and other storage automotive industrial medical and other embedded and server markets market concentrations from 2014  net sales were approximately as follows 30  for compute and graphics including desktop pcs notebooks and workstations 20  for mobile 20  for ssd and other storage 10  for automotive industrial medical and other embedded and 10  for server sales to kingston primarily dram were 10  of our net sales in 2014  sales to intel primarily nand flash products through im flash were 8  of our net sales in 2014  10  of our net sales in 2013  and 12  of our net sales in 2012  sales to hp primarily dram were 9  of our net sales in 2014  10  of our net sales in 2013  and 8  of our net sales in 2012  

our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron lexar® crucial™ spectek® and elpida brand names and private labels we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world we sell lexarbranded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several months 

backlog 

because of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

 6 

product warranty 

because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery under our general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions 

competition 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation sk hynix inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices many of our highvolume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors for these highvolume memory products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factors for our other memory products the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence to pricing 

research and development 

our process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies as well as new fundamentally different memory structures materials and packages which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram and lpdram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including 3d nand and mlc and tlc technologies nor flash memory specialty memory ssds  hmcs and other memory technologies and systems 

our rd expenses were 137 billion 931 million and 918 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we share certain rd process technology and design costs for nand flash and emerging technologies with intel we shared rd process and design costs for dram with nanya through december 2012 when our costsharing agreement was terminated as a result of reimbursements under our intel and nanya costsharing arrangements our overall rd expenses were reduced by 137 million 146 million and 225 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

to compete in the semiconductor memory industry we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions our process design and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world with our largest rd centers located in boise idaho hiroshima japan hashimoto japan and milpitas california we have several additional product design centers in other strategic locations around the world in addition we develop photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boise 

rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have from time to time licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties some of these license agreements require us to make onetime or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

employees 

as of august 28 2014 we had approximately 30400 employees 

environmental compliance 

government regulations impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges emissions and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes in 2014 our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of iso 14001 certification to continue certification we must meet annual requirements in environmental policy compliance planning management structure and responsibility training communication document control operational control emergency preparedness and response record keeping and management review while we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures modification of our operations or other compliance actions 

directors and executive officers of the registrant 

our executive officers are appointed annually by the board of directors and our directors are elected annually by our shareholders any directors appointed by the board of directors to fill vacancies on the board serve until the next election by the shareholders all officers and directors serve until their successors are duly chosen or elected and qualified except in the case of earlier death resignation or removal

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of us 

we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business 

if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in recent years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future in some prior periods average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future 



we may be unable to maintain or improve gross margins 

our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes including reducing the die size of our existing products in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to maintain or improve gross margins factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes difficulty in transitioning to smaller linewidth process technologies technological barriers and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products 

the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation sk hynix inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments such as china may be considering providing or have provided significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs transitions to smaller linewidth process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 11 

our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks 

we have a supply agreement with inotera the inotera supply agreement under which we are obligated to purchase substantially all of inoteras dram output over an initial threeyear term at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components currently through december 2016 the inotera supply agreement contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive oneyear extensions and if the parties do not agree to an extension the agreement will terminate following the end of the thenexisting term plus a subsequent threeyear winddown period in the event of a winddown our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period we are currently in negotiations regarding the extension of the inotera supply agreement there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement our inotera supply agreement involves numerous additional risks including the following 

 

for 2014 we purchased 268 billion  of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 38 of our aggregate dram gigabit production if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition 

we are engaged in a capital intensive business subject to significant changes in supply and demand and product pricing and recent periods of consolidation any of which could result in our incurrence or assumption of indebtedness in recent periods our debt levels have increased as of august 28 2014  we had debt with a carrying value of 659 billion in addition the conversion value in excess of principal amount for our convertible notes outstanding as of august 28 2014  was 299 billion in 2014 we paid 230 billion to repurchase and settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of 109 billion in the first quarter of 2015 we paid 389 million  to settle conversion obligations for convertible notes with a principal amount of 114 million as of august 28 2014  as of august 28 2014  we had two credit facilities available that provide for up to 408 million of additional financing subject to outstanding balances of trade receivables and other conditions events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy the applicable drawdown conditions and utilize either of these facilities we have in the past and expect in the future to continue to incur additional debt to finance our capital investments including debt incurred in connection with assetbacked financing 

our debt obligations could adversely impact us for example these obligations could 

 

our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future this to some extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 12 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rd and product and process technology we estimate that capital spending for 2015 will be approximately 36 billion to 40 billion in addition as a result of the mmj acquisition we believe that our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels as we integrate our manufacturing operations and support the increase of capacity resulting from the transaction as of august 28 2014  we had cash and equivalents of 415 billion shortterm investments of 384 million and longterm marketable investments of 819 million cash and investments included 160 billion held by mmj and its consolidated subsidiaries and 84 million  held by imft none of which is generally available to finance our other operations 

as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings with the japan court under the corporate reorganization act of japan the japan proceedings for so long as such proceedings are continuing the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies installment payments these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the mmj companies as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court as a result the assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries while available to satisfy the mmj companies installment payments and the other obligations capital expenditures and other operating needs of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are not available for use by us in our other operations furthermore certain uses of the assets of the mmj companies including investments in certain capital expenditures in mmt may require consent of mmjs trustees andor the japan court 

in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our current debt levels expected debt amortization and general economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows use cash held by mmj to fund its capital expenditures access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt amortization payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda 

on january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimonda insolvency proceedings filed suit against mti and micron semiconductor bv our netherlands subsidiary micron bv in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron bv and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron bv purchased substantially all of qimondas shares of inotera memories inc the inotera shares representing approximately 55 of our total shares in inotera and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks among other things to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent crosslicense between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement

following a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate on march 13 2014 the court issued judgments 1 ordering micron bv to pay approximately 1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase 2 ordering micron bv to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties 3 ordering micron bv to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares including in particular any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits 4 denying qimonda’s claims against micron technology for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera and 5 determining that qimondas obligations under the patent crosslicense agreement are cancelled in addition the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering among other things 1 that micron bv transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by it and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties and 2 that micron bv pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares the interlocutory judgments have no immediate enforceable effect on us and accordingly we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case we have filed a notice of appeal and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court a hearing on the matter is scheduled for february 2 2015 

we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or equivalent monetary damages unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron bv from the ownership of the inotera shares andor the termination of the patent crosslicense which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as of august 28 2014 the inotera shares had a carrying value for purposes of our financial reporting of 505 million and a market value of 206 billion 

our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies 

our key semiconductor memory technologies of dram nand flash and nor flash face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability to meet these requirements we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance andor cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies    there can be no assurance of the following 

 

if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

new product development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development including systemlevel memory products over the next several years the process to develop dram nand flash nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 

 14 

products that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

 

a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see item 1 legal proceedings 

we have a number of intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks 

we have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these relationships include our imft nand flash joint venture with intel our inotera dram joint venture with nanya and our mp mask joint venture with photronics these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the following 

 

if our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

 15 

the operations of the mmj companies will be subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings 

because the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of mmj the japan proceedings are continuing and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the japan proceedings the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition 

during the pendency of the japan proceedings the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively integrate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companies 

if our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the us singapore taiwan japan and china additionally our control over operations at our imft inotera mp mask and tera probe joint ventures is limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment equipment failures earthquakes or other environmental acts if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships any of which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur additional restructure or other charges in future periods 

in recent periods we have implemented restructure activities and may implement restructure initiatives in future periods as a result we could incur restructure charges including but not limited to severance and other termination benefits losses on disposition or impairment of equipment or other longlived assets and inventory write downs lose production output lose key personnel and experience disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products in connection with these actions we recorded charges of 40 million for 2014 and 126 million for 2013 we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional costs for these prior restructure activities we may incur additional restructure charges or other losses associated with other initiatives in future periods 

 16 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

across our multinational operations there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the euro the singapore dollar the new taiwan dollar the yen and the yuan we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 28 million for 2014 and 229 million for 2013 based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities offset by balance sheet hedges we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 7 million  as of august 28 2014  in addition a significant portion of our manufacturing costs are denominated in foreign currencies exchange rates for some of these currencies against the us dollar particularly the yen have been volatile in recent periods if these currencies strengthen against the us dollar our manufacturing costs could significantly increase in the event that the exchange rates for us dollar adversely change against our foreign currency exposures in the euro singapore dollar new taiwan dollar the yen and the yuan our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we may make future acquisitions andor alliances which involve numerous risks 

acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 

 

in recent years supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram nand flash and nor flash products resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants including the liquidation of qimonda and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida now known as mmj these types of proceedings often lead to courtdirected processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 17 

the limited availability of raw materials supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations require raw materials and in certain cases third party services that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials and services however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials and services that meet our standards in some cases materials components or services are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials or components such as silicon wafers controllers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future we andor our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials or services is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier from time to time we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the suppliers limited capacity our inability to timely obtain this equipment could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp if we are unable to timely obtain advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions including among others singapore where we currently have arrangements that allow us to compute our tax provision at rates below the local statutory rates our domestic and international taxes are dependent upon the distribution of our earnings among these different jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including challenges by tax authorities to our tax structure income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations we and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with the us federal government various us states and various foreign jurisdictions throughout the world our us federal and state tax returns remain open to examination for 2010 through 2014 in addition tax returns open to examination in multiple foreign taxing jurisdictions range from the years 2005 to 2014 the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability 

we may not utilize all of our net deferred tax assets 

we have substantial deferred tax assets which include among others net operating loss and credit carryforwards as of august 28 2014  our us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards including uncertain tax benefits were 389 billion  and 171 billion  respectively which if not utilized will expire at various dates from 2015 through 2033 as of august 28 2014  our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were 537 billion including 395 billion  pertaining to japan which if not utilized substantially all will expire at various dates from 2018 through 2023 as of august 28 2014  we had valuation allowances of 129 billion  and 979 million against our net deferred tax assets in the us and japan respectively 

a downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business 

downturns in the worldwide economy have harmed our business in the past and future downturns could also adversely affect our business adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers mobile devices solidstate drives and servers reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets could limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 18 

our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate 

we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster fire explosion or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

sales to customers outside the united states approximated 84  of our consolidated net sales for 2014 in addition a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states in particular a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in taiwan singapore and japan our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

these factors may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

breaches of our network security could expose us to losses 

we manage and store on our network systems various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations we also process store and transmit large amounts of data relating to our customers and employees including sensitive personal information computer programmers and hackers may be able to gain unauthorized access to our network system and steal proprietary information compromise confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers 

we are subject to counterparty default risks 

we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash deposits investments cappedcall contracts on our stock and derivative instruments as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding in the event of such default we could incur significant losses which could adversely impact our business results of operations or financial condition 

 19 

compliance with new regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act and its implementing sec regulations the doddfrank act imposes new supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo the drc and finance or benefit local armed groups these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict free

 item 3 legal proceedings 

reorganization proceedings of the mmj companies 

on july 31 2013 we completed the acquisition of elpida now known as mmj a japanese corporation pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement on support for reorganization companies as amended the sponsor agreement that we entered into on july 2 2012 with the trustees of the mmj companies pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan 

the mmj companies filed petitions for commencement of corporate reorganization proceedings with the japan court under the corporate reorganization act of japan on february 27 2012 and the japan court issued an order to commence the reorganization proceedings the japan proceedings on march 23 2012 on july 2 2012 we entered into the sponsor agreement with the legal trustees of the mmj companies and the japan court approved the sponsor agreement under the sponsor agreement we agreed to provide certain support for the reorganization of the mmj companies and the trustees agreed to prepare and seek approval from the japan court and the mmj companies creditors of plans of reorganization consistent with such support 

the trustees initially submitted the proposed plans of reorganization for the mmj companies to the japan court on august 21 2012 and submitted final proposed plans on october 29 2012 on october 31 2012 the japan court approved submission of the trustees proposed plans of reorganization to creditors for approval on february 26 2013 the mmj companies creditors approved the reorganization plans and on february 28 2013 the japan court issued an order approving the plans of reorganization appeals filed by certain creditors of mmj in japan challenging the plan approval order issued by the japan court were denied 

in a related action mmj filed a verified petition for recognition and chapter 15 relief in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the us court on march 19 2012 and on april 24 2012 the us court entered an order that among other things recognized mmjs corporate reorganization proceeding as a foreign main proceeding pursuant to 11 usc § 1517b on june 25 2013 the us court issued a recognition order which recognized the order of the japan court approving mmjs plan of reorganization on november 19 2013 the us court closed the us chapter 15 proceeding 

the plans of reorganization provide for payments by the mmj companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items the plans of reorganization also provided for the investment by us pursuant to the sponsor agreement of 60 billion yen 615 million paid at closing in cash into mmj in exchange for 100 ownership of mmjs equity and the use of such investment to fund the initial installment payment by the mmj companies to their creditors of 60 billion yen subject to reduction for certain items specified in the sponsor agreement and plans of reorganization 

under mmjs plan of reorganization secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their fixed claims and unsecured creditors will recover at least 174 of the amount of their fixed claims the actual recovery of unsecured creditors will be higher however based in part on events and circumstances occurring following the plan approval the remaining portion of the unsecured claims will be discharged without payment over the period that payments are made pursuant to the plans of reorganization the secured creditors will be paid in full on or before the sixth installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments mais plan of reorganization provides that secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their claims whereas unsecured creditors will recover 19 of the amount of their claims the secured creditors of mai were paid in full on the first installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments 

 21 

because the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of the mmj acquisition the japan proceedings are continuing and the mmj companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the reorganization proceedings the business trustee will make decisions in relation to the operation of the businesses of the mmj companies other than decisions in relation to acts that need to be carried out in connection with the japan proceedings which will be the responsibility of the legal trustee the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court will continue until the final creditor payment is made under the mmj companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date the mmj companies may petition the japan court for an early termination of the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made although such early terminations are customarily granted there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition in these particular cases 

during the pendency of the japan proceedings the mmj companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling material disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the mmj companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively integrate the mmj companies as part of our global operations or to cause the mmj companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the mmj companies 

rambus 

on may 5 2004 rambus inc rambus filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county against us and other dram suppliers which alleged that the defendants harmed rambus by engaging in concerted and unlawful efforts affecting rambus dram by eliminating competition and stifling innovation in the market for computer memory technology and computer memory chips rambus complaint alleged various causes of action under california state law including among other things a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices a conspiracy to monopolize intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and unfair competition rambus sought a judgment for damages of approximately 390 billion joint and several liability trebling of damages awarded punitive damages a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint interest and attorneys fees and costs trial began on june 20 2011 and the case went to the jury on september 21 2011 on november 16 2011 the jury found for us on all claims on april 2 2012 rambus filed a notice of appeal to the california 1st district court of appeal 

we were engaged in litigation with rambus relating to certain of rambus patents and certain of our claims and defenses our lawsuits with rambus related to patent matters were pending in the us district court for the district of delaware us district court for the northern district of california germany france and italy 

in december 2013 we settled all pending litigation between us and rambus including all antitrust and patent matters we also entered into a sevenyear term patent crosslicense agreement with rambus that allows us to avoid costs of patentrelated litigation during the term we agreed to pay rambus up to 10 million per quarter over seven years for a total of 280 million beginning in the second quarter of 2014 the primary benefits we received from these arrangements were 1 the settlement and termination of all existing litigation 2 the avoidance of future litigation expenses and 3 the avoidance of future management and customer disruptions as a result other operating expense for the first quarter of 2014 included a 233 million charge to accrue a liability which reflects the discounted value of amounts due under this arrangement

on december 7 2007 tessera inc filed a patent infringement action against mmj elpida memory usa inc and numerous other defendants in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas the complaint alleges that certain mmj and elpida memory usa inc products infringe four us patents and seeks injunctive relief damages attorneys fees and costs prior to answering the complaint mmj and elpida memory usa inc and other defendants filed motions to stay the case pending final resolution of a case before the international trade commission itc against mmj and elpida memory usa inc and other respondents alleging infringement of the same patents asserted in the eastern district of texas case in the matter of certain semiconductor chips with minimized chip package size and products containing same iii itc no 337ta630 the itc action on february 25 2008 the eastern district of texas court granted the defendants motion to stay the action on december 29 2009 the itc issued a notice of final determination in the itc action finding no violation by mmj and elpida memory usa inc tessera inc subsequently appealed the matter to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit on may 23 2011 the federal circuit affirmed the itcs final determination additionally by operation of the recognition order plaintiff in that action is permanently enjoined from continuing its case against mmj and elpida memory usa in respect of any claim or claims arising prior to the commencement of the japan proceeding as defined in the recognition order on july 30 2014 we entered into a fiveyear term patent crosslicense agreement with tessera which also settled the pending litigation against mmj and elpida memory usa the agreement which requires us to make quarterly payments over its term gives us lifeofproduct protection for specifically identified dram products and a term license for certain other products 

among other things the above lawsuits pertain to certain of our ddr ddr2 ddr3 sdr sdram psram rldram lpdram nand flash image sensor products and certain other memory products we manufacture which account for a significant portion of our net sales 

 23 

except for the tessera matter discussed above we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss a determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others or entering into a license agreement covering such intellectual property could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

antitrust matters 

a number of purported class action pricefixing lawsuits have been filed against us and other dram suppliers four cases have been filed in the us district court for the northern district of california asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that indirectly purchased dram andor products containing dram from various dram suppliers during the time period from april 1 1999 through at least june 30 2002 the complaints allege a conspiracy to increase dram prices in violation of federal and state antitrust laws and state unfair competition law andor unjust enrichment relating to the sale and pricing of dram products the complaints seek joint and several damages trebled monetary damages restitution costs interest and attorneys fees in addition at least sixtyfour cases have been filed in various state courts asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of indirect purchasers of dram in july 2006 the attorneys general for approximately forty us states and territories filed suit in the us district court for the northern district of california the complaints allege among other things violations of the sherman act cartwright act and certain other states consumer protection and antitrust laws and seek joint and several damages trebled as well as injunctive and other relief on october 3 2008 the california attorney general filed a similar lawsuit in california superior court purportedly on behalf of local california government entities alleging among other things violations of the cartwright act and state unfair competition law on june 23 2010 we executed a settlement agreement resolving these purported classaction indirect purchaser cases and the pending cases of the attorneys general relating to alleged dram pricefixing in the united states subject to certain conditions we agreed to pay approximately 67 million in aggregate in three equal installments over a twoyear period we paid the full amount into an escrow account by the end of the first quarter of 2013 in accordance with the settlement agreement

we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss except as noted in the above discussion of the us indirect purchaser cases the final resolution of these alleged violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

securities matters 

on july 12 2013 seven former shareholders of elpida now known as mmj filed a complaint against messrs sakamoto adachi gomi shirai tsayjiu wataki kinoshita and takahasi in their capacity as members of the board of directors of mmj as of february 2013 the complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in various acts and misrepresentations to hide the financial condition of mmj and deceive shareholders prior to mmj filing a petition for corporate reorganization on february 27 2013 the plaintiffs seek joint and several damages equal to the market value of shares owned by each of the plaintiffs on february 23 2013 along with attorneys fees and interest at a hearing on september 25 2013 the plaintiffs withdrew the complaint against mr tsayjiu 

we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this matter could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

qimonda 

on january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimonda insolvency proceedings filed suit against mti and micron semiconductor bv our netherlands subsidiary micron bv in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between micron bv and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which micron bv purchased substantially all of qimondas shares of inotera memories inc the inotera shares representing approximately 55 of our total shares in inotera and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer those shares to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks among other things to recover damages for the alleged value of the joint venture relationship with inotera and to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent crosslicense between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement 

following a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses on behalf of the qimonda estate on march 13 2014 the court issued judgments 1 ordering micron bv to pay approximately 1 million in respect of certain inotera shares sold in connection with the original share purchase 2 ordering micron bv to disclose certain information with respect to any inotera shares sold by it to third parties 3 ordering micron bv to disclose the benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares including in particular any profits distributed on such shares and all other benefits 4 denying qimonda’s claims against micron technology for any damages relating to the joint venture relationship with inotera and 5 determining that qimondas obligations under the patent crosslicense agreement are cancelled in addition the court issued interlocutory judgments ordering among other things 1 that micron bv transfer to the qimonda estate the inotera shares still owned by it and pay to the qimonda estate compensation in an amount to be specified for any inotera shares sold to third parties and 2 that micron bv pay the qimonda estate as compensation an amount to be specified for benefits derived by it from ownership of the inotera shares the interlocutory judgments have no immediate enforceable effect on us and accordingly we expect to be able to continue to operate with full control of the inotera shares subject to further developments in the case we have filed a notice of appeal and the parties have submitted briefs to the appeals court a hearing on the matter is scheduled for february 2 2015 

we are unable to predict the outcome of the matter and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or equivalent monetary damages unspecified damages based on the benefits derived by micron bv from the ownership of the inotera shares andor the termination of the patent crosslicense which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as of august 28 2014 the inotera shares had a carrying value for purposes of our financial reporting of 505 million and a market value of 206 billion

our managements discussion and analysis mda is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations financial condition and cash flows mda is organized as follows 

 

overview 

for an overview of our business see item 1 – business – overview our results of operations for 2014 were affected by the following key transaction 

acquisition of micron memory japan inc 

on july 31 2013 we completed the mmj acquisition in which we acquired elpida now known as mmj and a controlling interest in rexchip now known as mmt in 2014 we purchased additional interests in mmt increasing our ownership interest to 995 in connection with the mmj acquisition we recorded net assets of 260 billion noncontrolling interests of 168 million and a gain on the transaction of 148 billion in 2013 in the second quarter of 2014 the provisional amounts recorded in connection with the mmj acquisition were adjusted primarily for prepetition liabilities as a result other nonoperating expense for 2014 included these measurement period adjustments of 33 million see item 8 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – micron memory japan inc note 

the mmj acquisition included a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in hiroshima japan a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility in taichung city taiwan and an assembly and test facility located in akita japan these wafer fabrication facilities together represented approximately 30 of our total wafer capacity for 2014 the mmj groups products include mobile dram targeted to mobile phones and tablets and computing dram targeted to desktop pcs servers notebooks and workstations the operations from the mmj acquisition are included primarily in the mbu and cnbu segments

results of operations 

consolidated results 



business segments 

we have the following four business units which are our reportable segments 

compute and networking business unit cnbu  includes dram and nor flash products sold to the compute networking graphics and cloud server markets 

mobile business unit mbu   includes dram nand flash and nor flash products sold to the smartphone feature phone and tablet mobiledevice market 

storage business unit sbu  includes nand flash components and ssds sold into enterprise and client storage cloud and removable storage markets sbu also includes nand flash products sold to intel through our imft joint venture 

embedded business unit ebu   includes dram nand flash and nor flash products sold into automotive and industrial applications as well as the connected home and consumer electronics markets 

our other operations do not meet the thresholds of a reportable segment and are reported under all other in the third quarter of 2014 we reorganized our business units all prior period amounts reflect this reorganization 

net sales 



 31 

total net sales for 2014 increased 80 as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher cnbu and mbu sales resulting from the mmj acquisition net sales for all segments in 2014 also benefitted as compared to 2013 from increases in dram and nand flash sales volumes driven primarily by higher manufacturing output as a result of improvements in product and process technology and an increased share of output from inotera 

total net sales for 2013 increased 10 as compared to 2012 reflecting increases in cnbu ebu and mbu sales primarily due to higher levels of dram and nand flash gigabit sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices the increases in gigabit sales volumes for 2013 were primarily attributable to manufacturing efficiencies driven by improvements in product and process technologies increased dram supply from inotera due to the restructuring of our supply agreement and 355 million of dram sales from the mmj acquisition after its acquisition on july 31 2013 

gross margin 

our overall gross margin percentage improved to 33 for 2014 from 20 for 2013 primarily due to improvements in the gross margin percentage for cnbu and mbu as a result of higher margins for dram products the gross margin improvements for cnbu and mbu for 2014 as compared to 2013 resulted primarily from the mmj acquisition manufacturing cost reductions and higher average selling prices for cnbu 

through december 2012 we purchased 50 of inoteras wafer production capacity based on a marginsharing formula among nanya inotera and us since january 2013 we have purchased substantially all of inoteras dram output at a discount from market prices for our comparable components under a new supply agreement the inotera supply agreement our costs for supply from inotera increased in 2014 from 2013 due to increases in average selling prices for our dram products and the changes in the pricing terms the inotera supply agreement has a threeyear term currently through december 2016 that contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive oneyear extensions if the parties do not agree to an extension the agreement will terminate following the end of the thenexisting term plus a subsequent threeyear winddown period in the event of a winddown our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the winddown period in 2014 our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities we are currently in negotiations regarding the extension of the inotera supply agreement there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement under the inotera supply agreements we purchased 268 billion  126 billion  and 646 million  of dram products in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to reductions in costs and increases in average selling prices cost reductions for 2014 primarily reflected improvements in product and process technologies and the comparatively lower manufacturing costs of the mmj group partially offset by higher costs for product obtained under the inotera supply agreements for 2014 and the fourth quarter of 2013 our costs of goods sold for dram products included the sale of the mmj groups inventories recorded at fair value in the mmj acquisition which was higher than the manufacturing cost of such inventories this increased our costs of goods sold by approximately 153 million for 2014 and 41 million for 2013 

our overall gross margin percentage improved to 20 for 2013 from 12 for 2012 due to improvements in the gross margin percentage for cnbu and to a lesser extent ebu sbu and mbu primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions partially offset by declines in average selling prices manufacturing cost reductions for 2013 primarily resulted from improvements in product and process technologies 

operating results by business segments 

cnbu 



 32 

cnbu sales and operating results track closely with our average selling prices gigabit sales volumes and cost per gigabit for our consolidated sales of dram products see operating results by product – dram for further detail cnbu sales for 2014 increased 112 as compared to 2013 primarily due to 1 the mmj acquisition 2 higher average selling prices 3 increased dram supply from inotera as a result of the restructuring of our supply agreement and 4 higher output due to improvements in product and process technologies cnbu sales for 2014 as compared to 2013 were adversely impacted by the transition of production at one of our singapore wafer fabrication facilities from dram to nand flash cnbu operating income for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to the mmj acquisition higher average selling prices and manufacturing cost reductions 

cnbu sales for 2013 increased 30 as compared to 2012 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices cnbu operating margin for 2013 improved from 2012 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions as a result of improved product and process technologies partially offset by declines in average selling prices cnbu results of operations for 2013 included sales of 153 million and operating income of 21 million from the acquired mmj group cnbu sales and operating margins for 2012 were adversely impacted by a 58 million charge for a settlement with a customer 

mbu 



in 2014 mbu sales were comprised primarily of dram nand flash and nor flash in decreasing order of revenue with mobile dram products accounting for a significant majority of the sales mbu sales for 2014 increased 199 as compared to 2013 primarily due significant increases in mobile dram sales as a result of the mmj acquisition mbu operating margin for 2014 also improved from 2013 primarily due to the mmj acquisition and manufacturing cost reductions which significantly outpaced declines in average selling prices 

mbu sales increased 3 for 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to higher sales of mobile dram products as a result of the mmj acquisition partially offset by declines in sales of wireless nor flash products mbu results of operations for 2013 included sales of 192 million and operating income of 22 million from the mmj group sales of wireless nor flash products declined in 2014 as a result of weakness in market demand and our customer group in particular as well as a continued transition by customers to nand flash the improvement in mbu operating margin for 2013 from 2012 was primarily due to reductions in manufacturing sga and rd costs 

sbu 



sbu sales and operating results track closely with our average selling prices gigabit sales volumes and cost per gigabit for our sales of nand flash products see operating results by product – nand flash for further detail sbu sales for 2014 increased 23 from 2013 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices increases in gigabits sold for 2014 were primarily due to the transition in 2014 of production at one of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore from dram to nand flash and improvements in product and process technologies sbu sells a portion of its products to intel through our imft joint venture at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost sbu sales of nand flash products to intel under this arrangement were 423 million  387 million  and 718 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively all other sbu products are sold to oems resellers retailers and other customers including intel which we collectively refer to as trade customers 

sbu sales of nand flash products to trade customers for 2014 increased 26 as compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices sbu operating income for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to higher gigabit sales volumes as manufacturing cost reductions were essentially offset by declines in average selling prices 

 33 

 sbu sales for 2013 were relatively unchanged from 2012 as increases in gigabits sold were partially offset by declines in average selling prices increases in gigabits sold for 2013 were primarily due to improvements in product and process technologies sbu sales of nand flash products to trade customers for 2013 increased 22 as compared to 2012 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices on april 6 2012  we acquired intels interests and supply rights from im flash wafer fabrication facilities in singapore and virginia resulting in subsequent increases in our sales to trade customers sbu operating income for 2013 declined from 2012 primarily due to decreases in average selling prices and increases in rd costs mitigated by manufacturing cost reductions manufacturing cost reductions resulted primarily from improvements in product and process technologies 

ebu 



in 2014 ebu sales were comprised of dram nand flash and nor flash in decreasing order of revenue ebu sales for 2014 increased 39 as compared to 2013 primarily due to increased sales volumes of dram and nand flash products partially offset by declines in average selling prices ebu operating income for 2014 improved as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher margins on sales of dram and nand flash products as a result of the increase in sales and cost reductions 

in 2013 ebu sales were comprised of dram nor flash and nand flash in decreasing order of revenue ebu sales increased 16 for 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to increased sales volumes of dram nand flash and nor flash products as ebu continued to expand its customer base partially offset by declines in average selling prices ebu operating income for 2013 improved from 2012 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions and higher sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices 

operating results by product 

net sales by product 



in order to balance our future product mix in anticipation of the closing of the mmj acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2013 we began to transition production at one of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore from dram to nand flash this transition to nand flash production is substantially complete during this period of transition there was a marginal reduction in wafer production 

dram 



 34 

the increase in gigabit sales of dram products for 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher production volumes resulting from the mmj acquisition increased supply under the new inotera supply agreement and improved product and process technologies partially offset by the transition of one of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore from dram to nand flash in 2014 dram products produced by our mmj group facilities constituted 54 of our aggregate dram gigabit production as compared to 9 in 2013 

in 2014 our cost of products purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities and were higher than our costs in 2013 dram products acquired from inotera accounted for 38 of our dram gigabit production for 2014 as compared to 54 for 2013 and 46 for 2012 

our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2014 improved from 2013 primarily due to reductions in costs and increases in average selling prices cost reductions for 2014 primarily reflected improvements in product and process technologies and the comparatively lower manufacturing costs of the mmj group partially offset by higher costs for product obtained under the inotera supply agreement and the sale of the mmj groups inventories recorded in the mmj acquisition 

the increase in gigabit sales of dram products for 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to increased output obtained from our inotera joint venture under the new supply agreement improved product and process technologies and the mmj acquisition on july 31 2013 our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2013 improved from 2012 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions as a result of improvements in product and process technologies partially offset by declines in average selling prices dram sales and gross margins for 2012 were adversely impacted by the effects of a 58 million charge to revenue for a settlement with a customer 

nand flash 

we sell a portion of our output of nand flash products to intel through imft at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost see operating results by business segments – storage business unit for further detail we sell the remainder of our nand flash products to trade customers 



increases in nand flash gigabits sold to trade customers for 2014 as compared to 2013 were primarily due to the transition of one of our wafer fabrication facilities in singapore from dram to nand flash production and improved product and process technologies our gross margin percentage on sales of trade nand flash products for 2014 was relatively unchanged from 2013 as manufacturing cost reductions offset declines in average selling prices manufacturing cost reductions for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily resulted from improvements in product and process technologies 

increases in nand flash gigabits sold to trade customers for 2013 as compared to 2012 were primarily due to improved product and process technologies increased output available for sale to trade customers due to the restructure of our im flash agreement with intel in april 2012 and the rampup of our fabrication facility in singapore throughout 2012 our gross margin percentage on sales of nand flash products for 2013 improved from 2012 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices manufacturing cost reductions for 2013 as compared to 2012 reflect improvements in product and process technologies 

nor flash 

sales of nor flash products for 2014 declined as compared to 2013 primarily due to decreases in sales of wireless nor flash products as a result of the continued transition of wireless applications to nand flash products our gross margin percentage on sales of nor flash products for 2014 declined as compared to 2013 primarily due to costs of underutilized capacity in connection with the decrease in production of wireless products and decreases in average selling prices 

 35 

sales of nor flash products for 2013 declined as compared to 2012 primarily due to decreases in sales of wireless nor flash products as a result of weakness in demand from certain customers and the continued transition of wireless applications to nand flash products which led to significant declines in average selling prices our gross margin percentage on sales of nor flash products for 2013 improved as compared to 2012 primarily due to cost reductions 

operating expenses and other 

selling general and administrative 

sga expenses for 2014 increased 26 as compared to 2013 primarily due to the incremental costs resulting from the mmj acquisition and higher payroll costs resulting primarily from the reinstatement of variable pay plans we expect that sga expenses will approximate 195 million to 205 million for the first quarter of 2015 

sga expenses for 2013 decreased 9 as compared to 2012 primarily due to a reduction in legal costs and lower variable pay costs partially offset by 50 million  of consulting and other costs incurred in connection with the mmj acquisition 

research and development 

rd expenses for 2014 increased 47 from 2013 primarily due to the incremental costs resulting from the mmj acquisition higher payroll costs resulting primarily from the reinstatement of variable pay plans and increased resources dedicated to development efforts we expect that rd expenses net of amounts reimbursable from our rd partners will be approximately 395 million to 405 million for the first quarter of 2015 

rd expenses for 2013 increased 1 from 2012 primarily due to lower reimbursements from nanya under partnering arrangements offset by lower payroll costs primarily resulting from the suspension of variable pay plans and a lower volume of development wafers processed 

as a result of amounts reimbursable from intel under a joint development program for nand flash and certain emerging memory technologies rd expenses were reduced by 137 million  127 million  and 87 million  for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively as a result of amounts reimbursable from nanya under a dram rd joint development program rd expenses were reduced by 19 million  and 138 million  for 2013 and 2012 respectively effective january 1 2013 nanya ceased participating in the dram joint development program 

our process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram mobile lpdram products high density nand flash memory including 3d nand and mlc and tlc technologies ssds hybrid memory cubes specialty memory nor flash memory and other memory technologies and systems 

restructure and asset impairments 



 36 

in order to optimize operations improve efficiency and increase our focus on our core memory operations we have entered into various restructure activities for 2014 and 2013 other restructure included charges associated with our efforts to wind down our 200mm operations primarily in agrate italy and kiryat gat israel and charges associated with workforce optimization activities primarily related to our mbu and ebu operating segments as of august 28 2014  we had accrued 14 million  for unpaid other restructure activities related to our workforce optimization activity as of august 28 2014  we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional costs for these restructure activities see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – restructure and asset impairments 

interest income expense 

net interest expense for 2014  2013  and 2012 included aggregate amounts of amortization of debt discount and other costs of 167 million  122 million  and 81 million  respectively 

income taxes 

income tax provision benefit for 2014 included 249 million of expenses related to the utilization of deferred tax assets by the mmj group partially offset by a 190 million benefit from increases in amount of mmj groups deferred tax assets expected to be realized based on our forecasted utilization of net operating losses the remaining tax provision for 2014 primarily reflects taxes on our other nonus operations the provision benefit for taxes on us operations for 2014 was substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowance as of august 28 2014 we had valuation allowances of 129 billion  against substantially all us net deferred tax assets and 115 billion related to our foreign subsidiaries primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards our valuation allowance decreased 712 million  for 2014 primarily due to the utilization of us and foreign net operating losses and due to the 190 million benefit to deferred tax assets of the mmj group the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if significant positive evidence increases management continues to evaluate future financial performance to determine whether such performance is sufficient evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowances our unrecognized tax benefits increased 150 million in 2014 primarily due to transfer pricing and other matters which was substantially offset by changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 

we currently operate in several tax jurisdictions where we have arrangements that allow us to compute our tax provision at rates below the local statutory rates that expire in whole or in part at various dates through 2026 these arrangements benefitted our tax provision in 2014 2013 and 2012 by 286 million 141 million and 52 million respectively 

income taxes for 2013 and 2012 primarily reflect taxes on our nonus operations offset by benefits of 19 million and 56 million respectively from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters and a change in tax laws applicable to prior years 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  notes to consolidated financial statements  income taxes 

equity in net income loss of equity method investees 

we recognize our share of earnings or losses from the entities listed below under the equity method generally on a twomonth lag equity in net income loss of equity method investees net of tax included the following 



our equity in net income loss of inotera improved for 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to inoteras improved operating results as a result of higher selling prices and lower manufacturing costs higher selling prices resulted from the new inotera supply agreement coupled with an improved market 

losses in 2012 for our other equity method investments were primarily attributable to transform solar pty ltd as of august 30 2012 transforms operations were substantially discontinued see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – equity method investments 

 37 

other operating and nonoperating 

in 2014 we settled all pending litigation between us and rambus including all antitrust and patent matters and entered into a patent crosslicense agreement as a result other operating expense for 2014 included a 233 million charge to accrue a liability which reflects the discounted value of amounts due under this arrangement see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – contingencies note 

other nonoperating expense for 2014 included losses from the restructure of our debt of 184 million  other nonoperating expense for 2013 included losses of 31 million  from the restructure of our debt see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – debt note 

other nonoperating expense included losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 28 million 229 million and 6 million for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the loss for 2013 includes a 228 million loss for currency contracts to hedge our yendenominated obligations in connection with the mmj acquisition see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – derivative instruments note 

on august 15 2014 on semiconductor corporation acquired aptina for approximately 433 million  and we recognized a nonoperating gain of 119 million  on the sale of our shares based on our diluted ownership interest of approximately 27  

on may 15 2014 inotera issued 400 million  common shares in a public offering at a price equal to 3150  new taiwan dollars per share which was in excess of our carrying value per share as a result of the issuance our ownership interest decreased from 35 to 33  and we recognized a nonoperating gain of 93 million  in 2014

our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and financing obtained from capital markets specifically in 2014 we generated cash from operations of 570 billion  and obtained 221 billion  of proceeds from issuance of debt cash generated from operations is highly dependent on selling prices for our products which can vary significantly from period to period we are continuously evaluating alternatives for efficiently financing our capital expenditures dilutionmanagement activities including repurchases of convertible notes or equity and ongoing operations we expect from time to time in the future to engage in a variety of transactions for such purposes including the issuance or incurrence of secured and unsecured debt and the refinancing and restructuring of existing debt 

on october 27 2014 we announced that our board of directors authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to 

100 billion of our outstanding common stock any repurchases under the new authorization may be made in open market purchases block trades privately negotiated transactions andor derivative transactions subject to market conditions and our ongoing determination that it is the best use of available cash we expect to use cash on hand to fund any repurchases the repurchase authorization does not obligate us to acquire any common stock 

we expect that our cash and investments cash flows from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through 2015 

 38 



as of august 28 2014  280 billion of our cash and equivalents and shortterm investments was held by foreign subsidiaries of which 758 million was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar to mitigate credit risk we invest through highcreditquality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting the amount of investments with any single obligor 

limitations on the use of cash and investments 

mmj group  cash and equivalents and shortterm investments in the table above included an aggregate of 160 billion held by the mmj group as of august 28 2014  as a result of the corporate reorganization proceedings of the mmj companies entered into in march 2012 and for so long as such proceedings are continuing the mmj companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the mmj companies prohibit the mmj companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the mmj companies installment payments these prohibitions also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the mmj companies from paying cash dividends to us as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the mmj companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the mmj companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the mmj companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustee and japan court as a result the assets of the mmj group while available to satisfy the mmj companies installment payments and the other obligations capital expenditures and other operating needs of the mmj group are not available for use by us in our other operations moreover certain uses of the assets of the mmj group including investments in certain capital expenditures and in mmt may require consent of mmjs trustees andor the japan court 

imft   cash and equivalents and shortterm investments in the table above included 84 million  held by imft as of august 28 2014  our ability to access funds held by imft to finance our other operations is subject to agreement by intel and contractual limitations amounts held by imft are not anticipated to be available to finance our other operations 

indefinitely reinvested   as of august 28 2014  we had 270 billion of cash and equivalents and shortterm investments that were held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the us would subject these funds to us federal income taxes determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries is not practicable 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 570 billion  for 2014 due primarily to a strong market for our products and our continued focus on costefficient operations operating cash flows in 2014 also benefitted by a 671 million  increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by a 518 million  increase in receivables 

 39 

investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities was 245 billion  for 2014 which consisted primarily of cash expenditures of 266 billion  for property plant and equipment and 506 million for the acquisition of availableforsale securities net of proceeds from sales and maturities of 557 million offset by the use of 534 million of restricted cash in connection with the first mmj creditor installment payment 

we believe that to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and capital equipment and rd we estimate that capital spending for 2015 will be approximately 36 billion to 40 billion the actual amounts for 2015 will vary depending on market conditions as of august 28 2014 we had commitments of approximately 118 billion  for the acquisition of property plant and equipment substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year 

financing activities 

net cash used by financing activities was 195 billion  for 2014 which included 384 billion  for repayments of debt including 120 billion for the amount in excess of principal of our convertible notes 479 million  of payments on equipment purchase contracts and 92 million  of net cash received from noncontrolling interests offset by 221 billion  of proceeds from issuance of debt and by 265 million  of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our equity plans 

2014 debt restructure 

throughout 2014 we reduced the dilutive effects of our convertible notes by exchanging converting or repurchasing a portion of these notes using cash generated from operations and proceeds from issuing nonconvertible debt with near investmentgrade covenants approximately 90 of our free cash flow cash flows from operating activities less expenditures for property plant and equipment less payments on equipment purchase contracts generated during 2014 was used for these dilutionmanagement activities as a result we eliminated convertible notes that would have been converted into 118 million shares of our common stock 

in 2014 we initiated a series of actions to restructure our debt including exchanges conversions and settlements repurchases issuances and early repayments the following table presents the net effect of each of the actions 



 2   the change in carrying value includes an increase of 275 million for the reclassification of the fair value of the equity component to debt in connection with our election to settle the conversions of the 2031b notes in cash 

  40 

 

subsequent to 2014 we settled an aggregate principal amount of 114 million  of our remaining 2031b notes for 389 million  and repaid a 120 million  note prior to its scheduled maturity 

available credit facilities  as of august 28 2014  we had credit facilities available that provide for up to 408 million of additional financing subject to outstanding balances of trade receivables and other conditions 

see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – debt note 

potential settlement obligations of convertible notes 

since the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 trading day periods ended on june 30 2014 and september 30 2014 exceeded 130 of the initial conversion price per share of our 2032 notes and 2033 notes holders of those notes have the right to convert their notes at any time through december 31 2014 for our convertible notes we have 1 the requirement to pay cash for the principal amount and the option to pay either cash shares of our common stock or any combination thereof for any remaining conversion obligation or 2 the option to pay cash issue shares of common stock or any combination thereof for the aggregate amount due upon conversion 

the following table summarizes the potential settlements as of august 28 2014 that we could be required to make if all holders converted their 2032 notes and 2033 notes 



 

 41 

contractual obligations 



1  amounts include mmj creditor installment payments convertible notes and other notes any future redemption or conversion of convertible debt could impact the amount and timing of our cash payments 

2  amounts reflect principal and interest 

3  amounts do not include contingent lease payments 

4  amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other longterm liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet including 335 million for the current portion of these longterm liabilities 

5  we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities therefore 255 million in aggregate of longterm income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities has been excluded from the preceding table however other noncurrent liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet included these uncertain tax positions and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities 

the obligations disclosed above do not include current liabilities except for the current portion of longterm debt the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services market prices changes to agreedupon amounts or timing of certain events for some obligations 

purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria 1 they are noncancellable 2 we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled or 3 we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services takeorpay if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancellable the entire value of the contract was included in the above table if the obligation is cancellable but we would incur a penalty if canceled the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation contracted minimum amounts specified in takeorpay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment 

under the inotera supply agreement effective on january 1 2013 we are obligated to purchase for a threeyear term currently through december 2016 substantially all of inoteras output at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components the inotera supply agreement contemplates annual negotiations with respect to potential successive oneyear extensions and if the parties do not agree to an extension the agreement will terminate following the end of the thenexisting term plus a subsequent threeyear winddown period in the event of a winddown our share of inoteras capacity would decline over the three year winddown period we purchased 268 billion  of dram products from inotera in 2014 under the inotera supply agreement the inotera supply agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity as quantities are based on qualified production output and pricing fluctuates as it is based on market prices therefore we did not include our obligations under the inotera supply agreement in the contractual obligations table above 

 42 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have entered into capped calls which are intended to reduce the effect of potential dilution from our convertible notes the capped calls provide for our receipt of cash or shares at our election from our counterparties if the trading price of our stock is above a specified initial strike price at the expiration dates the amounts receivable varies based on the trading price of our stock up to specified cap prices the dollar value of the cash or shares that we would receive from the capped calls on their expiration dates ranges from 0 if the trading price of our stock is below the initial strike price for all of the capped calls to 864 million if the trading price of our stock is at or above the cap price for all of the capped calls to purchase the capped calls we paid 57 million  in 2011 103 million  in 2012 and 48 million  in 2013 respectively the amounts paid were recorded as charges to additional capital for further details of our capped call arrangements see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – equity – micron shareholders equity – capped calls note 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

business acquisitions  accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values the items involving the most significant assumptions estimates and judgments included determining the fair value of the following 

 

consolidations  we have interests in joint venture entities that are vies determining whether to consolidate a vie requires judgment in assessing 1 whether an entity is a vie and 2 if we are the entitys primary beneficiary to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we evaluate whether we have a the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding and financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies requires significant assumptions and judgment 

contingencies  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date in accounting for the resolution of contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate amounts pertaining to periods prior to the resolution which are charged to operations in the period of resolution and amounts related to future periods 

 43 

income taxes  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in recent periods our results of operations have benefitted from increases in the amount of deferred taxes we expect to realize primarily from the levels of capital spending and increases in the amount of taxable income we expect to realize in japan and taiwan our income tax provision or benefit is dependent in part on our ability to forecast future taxable income in these and other jurisdictions such forecasts are inherently difficult and involve numerous judgments including among others projecting future average selling prices and sales volumes manufacturing and overhead costs levels of capital spending and other factors that significantly impact our analyses of the amount of net deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value cost includes labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated market values below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated market value of our memory inventory by approximately 254 million as of august 28 2014 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories inventories are primarily categorized as memory including dram nand flash and nor flash for purposes of determining lower of average cost or market the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 

property plant and equipment  we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

research and development  costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are valued in inventory 

stockbased compensation    stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgment 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock

recently issued accounting standards 

 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – recently issued accounting standards note 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio substantially all of our indebtedness is at fixed interest rates as a result the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates we estimate that as of august 28 2014  and august 29 2013 a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates of 1 would increase the fair value of our convertible notes and other notes by approximately 250 million and 147 million respectively the increase in interest expense caused by a 1 increase in the interest rates of our variablerate debt would not be significant 

as of august 28 2014  and august 29 2013 we held debt securities of 1653 million and 787 million respectively that were subject to interest rate risk we estimate that a 05 increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of these instruments by approximately 6 million as of august 28 2014  and 4 million as of august 29 2013 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in item 1a risk factors changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the functional currency for all of our operations is the us dollar as a result of our foreign operations we incur costs and carry certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies the substantial majority of our revenues are transacted in the us dollar however significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro the shekel the singapore dollar the new taiwan dollar the yen and the yuan we have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates we utilize currency forward and option contracts in these hedging programs our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

to hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities we utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities offset by balance sheet hedges we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 7 million  as of august 28 2014  and 19 million  as of august 29 2013  to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures and forecasted operating cash flows we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months and currency options that generally mature within 12 to 18 months 

as of august 28 2018 under the terms and conditions of the mmj companies plans of reorganization we are obligated to pay 142 billion  yen or the equivalent of 137 billion  based on exchange rates as of august 28 2014 to the external creditors of the mmj companies the installment payments are due at the end of each calendar year beginning in 2014 through 2019 to mitigate the risk that increases in exchange rates have on the payments due in 2014 and 2015 we entered into forward contracts to purchase 20 billion yen on november 28 2014 and 10 billion yen on november 27 2015 in addition the mmj companies cash and equivalent balances in yen mitigate the foreign currency exchange risk associated with the remaining installment payments due in 2015 and after see item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – debt – mmj creditor installment payments

overview 

we are one of the worlds leading providers of advanced semiconductor solutions through our worldwide operations we manufacture and market a full range of dram nand flash and nor flash memory as well as other innovative memory technologies packaging solutions and semiconductor systems for use in leadingedge computing consumer networking automotive industrial embedded and mobile products we market our products through our internal sales force independent sales representatives and distributors primarily to original equipment manufacturers oems and retailers located around the world our success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor products efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure successful ongoing development of advanced process technologies and generating a return on research and development rd investments 

we obtain products from three primary sources 1 production from our whollyowned manufacturing facilities 2 production from our joint venture manufacturing facilities and 3 to a lesser degree from third party manufacturers in recent years we have increased our manufacturing scale and product diversity through strategic acquisitions and various partnering arrangements including joint ventures 

 1 

we make significant investments to develop the proprietary product and process technologies that are implemented in our worldwide manufacturing facilities and through our joint ventures these investments enable our production of semiconductor products with increasing functionality and performance at lower costs we generally reduce the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technology such as our leadingedge linewidth process technology and innovative array architecture we continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics such as higher data transfer rates reduced package size lower power consumption improved read write reliability and increased memory density to leverage our significant investments in rd we have formed and may continue to form strategic joint ventures that allow us to share the costs of developing memory product and process technologies with joint venture partners in addition from time to time we also sell andor license technology to other parties we continue to pursue additional opportunities to monetize our investment in intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements 

on july 31 2013 we completed the acquisition of elpida memory inc elpida a japanese corporation pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement on support for reorganization companies as amended the sponsor agreement that we entered into on july 2 2012 with the trustees of elpida and one of its subsidiaries akita elpida memory inc a japanese corporation akita and together with elpida the elpida companies pursuant to and in connection with the elpida companies corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan we paid 615 million for the acquisition of 100 of elpidas equity on july 31 2013 we also acquired a 24 ownership interest in rexchip electronics corporation rexchip a taiwanese corporation and manufacturing joint venture formed by powerchip technology corporation powerchip and elpida from powerchip and certain of its affiliates the powerchip group pursuant to a share purchase agreement we paid 334 million in cash for the shares elpida and its subsidiaries the elpida group own approximately 65 of rexchips outstanding common stock therefore as a result of the consummation of our acquisition of elpida and the rexchip shares from the powerchip group we own approximately 89 of rexchips common stock the provisional fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include among other items cash and restricted cash aggregating 1618 million inventories of 962 million property plant and equipment of 935 million net deferred tax assets of 917 million and debt of 2134 million 

elpidas assets include among others a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in hiroshima japan its approximate 65 ownership interest in rexchip whose assets include a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in taichung city taiwan and a 100 ownership interest in akita whose assets include an assembly and test facility located in akita japan 

elpidas semiconductor memory products include mobile dram targeted toward mobile phones and tablets we believe that combining the complementary product portfolios of micron and elpida will strengthen our position in the memory market and enable us to provide customers with a wider portfolio of highquality memory solutions we also believe that our acquisition of elpida will strengthen our market position in the memory industry through increased research and development and manufacturing scale improved access to core memory market segments and additional wafer capacity to balance among our dram nand flash and nor flash memory solutions elpidas operations are included primarily in the dsg and wsg segments 

the elpida companies are currently subject to corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan because the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of the elpida acquisition these proceedings are continuing and the elpida companies remain subject to the oversight of the tokyo district court the japan court and of the trustees appointed by the japan court including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the reorganization proceedings as a result of this oversight and related consent rights of the japan court and the legal trustee our ability to effectively integrate the elpida companies as part of our global operations or to cause the elpida companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions for more information see part i item 1a risk factors and part i item 3 legal proceedings – reorganization proceedings of the elpida companies

partnering arrangements 

the following is a summary of our partnering arrangements as of august 29 2013 



 

  5 

 

in connection with the partnering agreement we have also deployed and licensed certain intellectual property related to the manufacture of dram products to nanya and licensed certain intellectual property from nanya through december 2012 we partnered with nanya to jointly develop process technology and designs to manufacture dram products under a costsharing arrangement effective beginning in april 2010 under which we shared dram development costs with nanya effective beginning january 2013 nanya ceased participating in the joint development program we receive royalties from nanya for sales of dram products manufactured by or for nanya with technology developed prior to april 2010 see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – equity method investments – inotera note 

 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china israel japan malaysia puerto rico singapore and taiwan our inotera joint venture also has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan in september 2013 we entered into an agreement to sell our 200mm wafer fabrication equipment in kiryat gat israel to intel and to terminate the related facility lease with intel if this transaction is completed intel will manufacture wafers for us at the kiryat gat facility through 2014 through a series of arrangements in 2011 we sold our wafer fabrication facility in japan to tower semiconductor ltd tower and entered into a supply agreement for tower to manufacture products for us in the facility through approximately may 2014 our manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment nand flash dram and nor flash products share common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines 

our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment we continuously enhance our production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in 2013 the majority of our dram production was manufactured on 30nm linewidth process technology in connection with our acquisition of elpida we expect in 2014 that a significant portion of our dram production will be manufactured on 25nm linewidth process technology in the fourth quarter of 2013 a majority of our nand flash memory products were manufactured on our 20nm linewidth process technology we expect to begin transitioning our nand flash production to our 16nm linewidth process technology in 2014 our nor flash memory products in 2013 were manufactured on our 65nm and 45nm linewidth process technologies we manufacture all of our highvolume nand flash and dram products on 300mm wafers in 2013 we manufactured nor flash some specialty dram and nonmemory products on 200mm wafers

wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process perform high temperature burnin on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition we use our proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie bare die forms our packaged products include memory modules mcps managed nand ssds memory cards and usb devices we assemble many products inhouse and in some cases we outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment we contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture nand flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices 

in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 

availability of raw materials 

our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases  including helium  photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

marketing and customers 

our products are sold into computing consumer networking telecommunications automotive industrial and mobile markets market concentrations from 2013 net sales were approximately as follows computing including desktop pcs servers notebooks and workstations 30  mobile 15  consumer electronics 15  ssds 15 and networking and storage 10  sales to intel primarily nand flash products through im flash were 10  of our net sales in 2013 12 of our net sales in 2012 and 10 of our net sales in 2011 sales to hewlettpackard company primarily of dram were 10 of our net sales in 2013 8 of our net sales in 2012 and 9 of our net sales in 2011 we expect that our acquisition of elpida will increase our concentration of sales to mobile graphics and computing markets in 2014 

our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron lexar® crucial™ spectek® and elpida brand names and private labels we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world we sell lexarbranded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several months 

backlog 

because of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

product warranty 

because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery under our general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions 

competition 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation sk hynix inc spansion inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices many of our highvolume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors for these highvolume memory products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factors for our other memory products the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence to pricing 

research and development 

our process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies as well as new fundamentally different memory structures materials and packages which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram and mobile low power ddr dram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including mlc and tlc technologies nor flash memory specialty memory ssds  hybrid memory cubes and other memory technologies and systems 

our rd expenses were 931 million 918 million and 791 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we generally share rd process and design costs for nand flash with intel we also share rd costs for certain emerging memory technologies with intel we generally shared rd process and design costs for dram with nanya through december 2012 when our costsharing agreement was terminated as a result of reimbursements under our intel and nanya costsharing arrangements our overall rd expenses were reduced by 146 million 225 million and 236 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

 7 

to compete in the semiconductor memory industry we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions our process design and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world with our largest rd centers located in boise idaho and hiroshima japan our largest design center is also located at our corporate headquarters in boise idaho we have several additional product design centers in other strategic locations around the world in 2012 we commenced operation of our new rd facility in boise which was designed to accommodate 450mm wafer manufacturing in addition we develop photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boise 

rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 

geographic information 

sales to customers outside the united states totaled 76 billion for 2013 and included 38 billion in sales in china 980 million in sales in taiwan 820 million in sales in europe 193 million in sales in malaysia and 13 billion in sales in the rest of the asia pacific region excluding china malaysia and taiwan sales to customers outside the united states totaled 70 billion for 2012 and 74 billion for 2011 as of august 29 2013 we had net property plant and equipment of 32 billion in singapore 30 billion in the united states 615 million in japan 350 million in china 307 million in taiwan 28 million in israel 18 million in italy and 42 million in other countries see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data –notes to consolidated financial statements – geographic information note and item 1a risk factors

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have from time to time licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties some of these license agreements require us to make onetime or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and potential partnering arrangements we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

employees 

as of august 29 2013 we had approximately 30900 employees of which approximately 19600 were outside the united states including approximately 7500 in singapore 3700 in japan 2700 in china 2100 in taiwan 1100 in italy 1000 in israel and 1000 in malaysia our employees include approximately 1700 in our imft joint venture primarily located in the united states and 5700 from our acquisition of elpida and rexchip primarily located in japan and taiwan in september 2013 we entered into an agreement to sell our 200mm wafer fabrication equipment in kiryat gat israel to intel and to terminate the related facility lease with intel if this transaction is completed most of our employees in israel will terminate their employment with us and be transferred to intel as of august 29 2013 we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional costs for this restructure activity our employment levels can vary depending on market conditions and the level of our production research and product and process development many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of us 

we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business 

if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in recent years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future in some prior periods average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future 



we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at the rate average selling prices decline 

our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes including reducing the die size of our existing products in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to improve or maintain gross margins factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes difficulty in transitioning to smaller linewidth process technologies technological barriers and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products 

the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation sk hynix inc spansion inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs transitions to smaller linewidth process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition

our acquisitions of elpida and rexchip involve numerous risks 

on july 31 2013 we completed the acquisition of elpida pursuant to the terms and conditions of the sponsor agreement that we entered into on july 2 2012 with the trustees of the elpida companies pursuant to and in connection with the elpida companies pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan we paid 615 million for the acquisition of 100 of elpidas equity on july 31 2013 we also acquired a 24 ownership interest in rexchip from the powerchip group pursuant to a share purchase agreement we paid 334 million in cash for the shares the elpida group owns approximately 65 of rexchips outstanding common stock therefore as a result of the consummation of our acquisition of elpida and the rexchip shares from the powerchip group we own approximately 89 of rexchips common stock the provisional fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include among other items cash and restricted cash aggregating 1618 million inventories of 962 million property plant and equipment of 935 million net deferred tax assets of 917 million and debt of 2134 million 

in addition to the acquisition risks described elsewhere these acquisitions are expected to involve the following significant risks 

 

our acquisitions of elpida and rexchip are inherently risky may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the operations of the elpida companies will be subject to continued oversight by the japan court during the pendency of the corporate reorganization proceedings 

because the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of our acquisition of elpida the japan proceedings are continuing and the elpida companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the japan proceedings the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court are expected to continue until the final creditor payment is made under the elpida companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date although we may be able to petition the court to terminate the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition 

during the pendency of the japan proceedings the elpida companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the elpida companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively integrate the elpida companies as part of our global operations or to cause the elpida companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the elpida companies

our acquisitions of elpida and rexchip expose us to significant risks from changes in currency exchange rates 

under the sponsor agreement we committed to support plans of reorganization for elpida that provide for payments to the secured and unsecured creditors of elpida in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen the us dollar amount of this payment obligation could increase if the yen strengthens against the us dollar additionally a significant portion of elpidas and rexchips operating costs are paid in yen and new taiwan dollars so our operating results subsequent to the acquisition could also be adversely impacted if these currencies strengthen against the us dollar 

our acquisitions of elpida and rexchip may increase our risk of significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting 

elpida and rexchip have not performed an assessment of the effectiveness of the design and operation of their internal control over financial reporting in addition elpida and rexchip have not historically prepared their financial statements under us generally accepted accounting standards elpida and rexchip were not required to be included in our assessment of internal controls for 2013 but will be included in our assessment for 2014 which may increase our risk for material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 

debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition 

we are engaged in a capital intensive business subject to significant changes in supply and demand and product pricing and recent periods of consolidation any of which could result in our incurrence or assumption of indebtedness in recent periods our debt levels have increased as of august 29 2013 we had 60 billion of debt including 485 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in 2014 as of august 29 2013 we had two credit facilities available that provides for up to 408 million of additional financing subject to outstanding balances of trade receivables and other conditions events and circumstances may occur which would cause us to not be able to satisfy the applicable drawdown conditions and utilize either of these facilities we have in the past and expect in the future to continue to incur additional debt to finance our capital investments including debt incurred in connection with assetbacked financing 

the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies provide for payments by the elpida companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen or the equivalent of approximately 205 billion less certain expenses of the japan proceedings and certain other items if the resolution of certain unfixed claims under the plans of reorganization primarily comprised of outstanding litigation claims would result in payments in respect of those claims in excess of amounts reserved under the plans of reorganization to satisfy such claims there is a possibility that the elpida companies would be required to pay more than 200 billion yen to their prepetition creditors under the plans of reorganization in addition if these unfixed claims are resolved pursuant to settlement arrangements or other postpetition agreements a substantial portion of the amounts payable with respect to the claims may have to be funded by the elpida companies outside of the installment payments provided for by the plans of reorganization 

our debt and our guarantee obligations could adversely impact us for example these obligations could 

 

our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future this to some extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 14 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations make scheduled debt payments and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rd and product and process technology we estimate that capital spending for 2014 will be approximately 26 billion to 32 billion in addition as a result of the elpida acquisition we believe that our future capital spending will be higher than our historical levels as we integrate our manufacturing operations and support the increase of capacity resulting from the elpida transaction as of august 29 2013 we had cash and equivalents of 2880 million shortterm investments of 221 million and longterm marketable investments of 499 million cash and investments included 1094 million held by elpida and its consolidated subsidiaries and 62 million held by im flash technologies llc imft none of which is generally available to finance our other operations 

as a result of the japan proceedings for so long as such proceedings are continuing the elpida companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies prohibit the elpida companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the elpida companies installment payments these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the elpida companies from paying cash dividends to us in respect of the shares of such subsidiaries owned by the elpida companies as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the elpida companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the elpida companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the elpida companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court as a result the assets of the elpida companies and their subsidiaries while available to satisfy the elpida companies installment payments and the other obligations capital expenditures and other operating needs of the elpida companies and their subsidiaries are not available for use by us in our other operations moreover certain uses of the assets of the elpida companies including investments in certain capital expenditures and in rexchip may require consent of elpidas trustees andor the japan court 

in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of our current debt levels expected debt amortization and general economic conditions it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows use cash held by elpida to fund its capital expenditures access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make debt amortization payments and make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks 

on january 17 2013 we entered into a new supply agreement with inotera the inotera supply agreement under which we are obligated to purchase substantially all of inoteras output at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks including the following 

 

inoteras financial situation may adversely impact the value of our interest and our supply agreement 

as of june 30 2013 inoteras current liabilities exceeded its current assets by 10 billion  which exposes inotera to liquidity risk additionally inotera incurred net losses of 541 million  for its fiscal year ended december 31 2012 as of june 30 2013 inotera was not in compliance with certain loan covenants and had not been in compliance for the past several years which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year inotera has applied for a waiver from complying with the june 30 2013 financial covenants inoteras management has implemented plans to improve its liquidity and for its sixmonth period ended june 30 2013 inotera generated net income of 91 million  however there can be no assurance that inotera will be successful in sufficiently improving its liquidity and complying with their loan covenants which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year if inotera is unable to continue to improve its liquidity we may have to impair our investment in inotera 

 15 

on january 17 2013 we entered into agreements with nanya technology corporation nanya to amend the joint venture relationship involving inotera under the inotera supply agreement we purchase substantially all of inoteras output at a purchase price based on a discount from actual market prices for comparable components the inotera supply agreement was retroactively effective beginning on january 1 2013 for the fourth quarter of 2013 we purchased 518 million of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 50 of our aggregate dram gigabit production if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

across our multinational operations there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the singapore dollar euro shekel and yen we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 229 million  for 2013 6 million  for 2012 and 6 million  for 2011 based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities offset by balance sheet hedges we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately 19 million  as of august 29 2013 in the event that the us dollar weakens significantly compared to the singapore dollar euro shekel or yen our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

in connection with the elpida sponsor agreement and rexchip share purchase agreement we entered into currency hedges to mitigate the risk that increases in exchange rates have on our planned yen payments in 2013 we recognized losses of 228 million on these hedges and made payments of 222 million to settle these hedges as of august 29 2013 to hedge certain yendenominated payments resulting from our acquisition of elpida we had an outstanding forward contract to purchase 20 billion yen on november 28 2014 at a yen per us dollar exchange rate of 9853 and a forward contract to purchase 10 billion yen on november 27 2015 at a yen per us dollar exchange rate of 9725 

the financial crisis and overall downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business 

the financial crisis and the overall downturn in the worldwide economy have had an adverse effect on our business a continuation or further deterioration of depressed economic conditions could have an even greater adverse effect on our business including any economic downturn resulting from the shutdown of the us federal government or any default by the us federal government on any of its debt or other obligations adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers networking products and mobile devices reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices and product sales a deterioration of current conditions in worldwide credit markets would limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we may incur additional material restructure or other charges in future periods 

in response to severe downturns in the semiconductor memory industry and global economic conditions we implemented restructure activities and may implement restructure initiatives in future periods we may restructure or dispose of assets as we continue to optimize our manufacturing operations including the winddown of 200millimeter wafer capacity as we migrate more products to 300millimeter wafer production as a result we could incur restructure charges including but not limited to severance and other termination benefits losses on disposition or impairment of equipment or other longlived assets and inventory write downs lose production output lose key personnel and experience disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products in connection with these actions we recorded 126 million in 2013 and may incur restructure charges or other losses associated with other initiatives in future periods 

we may make future acquisitions andor alliances which involve numerous risks 

acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 

  16 

 

in recent years supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices for dram nand flash and nor flash products resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants including the liquidation of qimonda ag and the 2012 bankruptcy filing by elpida memory inc these types of proceedings often lead to confidential courtdirected processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors and we may engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our future success depends on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies 

our key semiconductor memory technologies of dram nand flash and nor flash face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability to meet these requirements we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance andor cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies    there can be no assurance of the following 

 

if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

 17 

the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been legally challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda 

on january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimonda ag qimonda insolvency proceedings filed suit against us and micron semiconductor bv our netherlands subsidiary in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between us and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which we purchased all of qimondas shares of inotera memories inc and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer the inotera shares purchased from qimonda to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent cross license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement a threejudge panel will render a decision after a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses hearings were held on september 25 2012 february 5 2013 june 11 2013 and july 2 2013 an additional hearing is scheduled for november 12 2013 we are unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or equivalent monetary damages and the termination of the patent cross license which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as of august 29 2013 the inotera shares purchased from qimonda had a carrying value of 190 million 

our joint ventures and strategic relationships involve numerous risks 

we have entered into strategic relationships to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these relationships include our imft nand flash joint venture with intel corporation intel our inotera dram joint venture with nanya and our mp mask joint venture with photronics these joint ventures and strategic relationships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the following 

 

if our joint ventures and strategic relationships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

 18 

an adverse outcome relating to allegations of anticompetitive conduct could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

on may 5 2004 rambus inc rambus filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county against us and other dram suppliers which alleged that the defendants harmed rambus by engaging in concerted and unlawful efforts affecting rambus dram by eliminating competition and stifling innovation in the market for computer memory technology and computer memory chips rambus complaint alleged various causes of action under california state law including among other things a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices a conspiracy to monopolize intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and unfair competition rambus sought a judgment for damages of approximately 39 billion joint and several liability trebling of damages awarded punitive damages a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint interest and attorneys fees and costs trial began on june 20 2011 and the case went to the jury on september 21 2011 on november 16 2011 the jury found for us on all claims on april 2 2012 rambus filed a notice of appeal to the california 1st district court of appeal 

we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter an adverse court determination of any lawsuit alleging violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

on january 13 2006 rambus filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california rambus alleges that certain of our ddr2 ddr3 rldram and rldram ii products infringe as many as fourteen rambus patents and seeks monetary damages treble damages and injunctive relief the accused products account for a significant portion of our net sales on june 2 2006 we filed an answer and counterclaim against rambus alleging among other things antitrust and fraud claims on january 9 2009 in another lawsuit involving us and rambus and involving allegations by rambus of patent infringement against us in the us district court for the district of delaware judge robinson entered an opinion in favor of us holding that rambus had engaged in spoliation and that the twelve rambus patents in the suit were unenforceable against us rambus subsequently appealed the delaware courts decision to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit on may 13 2011 the federal circuit affirmed judge robinsons finding of spoliation but vacated the dismissal sanction and remanded the case to the delaware district court for analysis of the remedy based on the federal circuits decision on january 2 2013 judge robinson entered a new opinion in our favor holding that rambus had engaged in spoliation that rambus spoliation was done in bad faith that the spoliation prejudiced us and that the appropriate sanction was to declare the twelve rambus patents in the suit unenforceable against us on march 27 2013 rambus filed a notice of appeal to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit the northern district of california court stayed the trial of the patent phase of the northern district of california case upon appeal of the spoliation issue to the federal circuit in addition others have asserted and may assert in the future that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights see item 1 legal proceedings for additional details on these lawsuits 

we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

products that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition from time to time we experience problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products after we have shipped such products in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application as a result of these problems we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

  

 19 

 

new product development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop dram nand flash nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 

if our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs we maintain operations and continuously implement new product and process technology at our manufacturing operations which are widely dispersed in multiple locations in several countries including the us singapore taiwan japan israel and china additionally our control over operations at our imft inotera and mp mask and tera probe joint ventures is limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment and equipment failures if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

consolidation of industry participants and governmental assistance to some of our competitors may contribute to uncertainty in the semiconductor memory industry and negatively impact our ability to compete 

in recent years supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices of dram nand flash and nor flash products and substantial operating losses by us and our competitors the operating losses as well as limited access to sources of financing have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants and significant recent consolidation and in certain cases liquidation some of our competitors may try to enhance their capacity and lower their cost structure through consolidation in addition some governments have provided and may be considering providing significant financial assistance to some of our competitors consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

the limited availability of raw materials supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases including helium photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

 20 

our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier in recent periods we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the suppliers limited capacity our inability to timely obtain this equipment could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp if we are unable to timely obtain advanced semiconductor equipment our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate 

we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster fire chemical explosion or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited 

we have a valuation allowance against substantially all us net deferred tax assets as well as 15 billion related to our foreign subsidiaries as of august 29 2013 our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards were 42 billion and 22 billion respectively if not utilized our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2033 as of august 29 2013 our federal and state tax credit carryforwards were 238 million and 203 million respectively if not utilized our federal and state tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2033 as of august 29 2013 our foreign net operating loss carryforwards were 70 billion of which 59 billion pertains to elpida we have placed a valuation allowance against 47 billion of these foreign net operating loss carryforwards of which 38 billion pertains to elpida if not utilized our foreign net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2023 

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

sales to customers outside the united states approximated 83  of our consolidated net sales for 2013 in addition a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states in particular a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

these factors may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 21 

breaches of our network security could expose us to losses 

we manage and store on our network systems various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations we also process store and transmit large amounts of data for our customers including sensitive personal information computer programmers and hackers may be able to gain unauthorized access to our network system and steal proprietary information compromise confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers 

we are subject to counterparty default risks 

we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash deposits investments foreign currency option and forward contracts and cappedcall contracts on our stock as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations a counterparty may not comply with their contractual commitments which could then lead to their defaulting on their obligations with little or no notice to us which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding in the event of such default we could incur significant losses which could adversely impact our business results of operations or financial condition 

compliance with new regulations regarding the use of conflict minerals could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

increased focus on environmental protection and social responsibility initiatives led to the passage of section 1502 of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act and its implementing sec regulations the doddfrank act imposes new supply chain diligence and disclosure requirements for certain manufacturers of products containing specific minerals that may originate in or near the democratic republic of the congo the drc and finance or benefit local armed groups these conflict minerals are commonly found in materials used in the manufacture of semiconductors the implementation of these new regulations may limit the sourcing and availability of some of these materials this in turn may affect our ability to obtain materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in sufficient quantities and may affect related material pricing some of our customers may elect to disqualify us as a supplier if we are unable to verify that our products are drc conflict free

 item 3 legal proceedings 

reorganization proceedings of the elpida companies 

on july 31 2013 we completed the acquisition of elpida memory inc elpida a japanese corporation pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement on support for reorganization companies as amended the sponsor agreement that we entered into on july 2 2012 with the trustees of elpida and one of its subsidiaries akita elpida memory inc a japanese corporation akita and together with elpida the elpida companies pursuant to and in connection with the elpida companies pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan 

the elpida companies filed petitions for commencement of corporate reorganization proceedings with the tokyo district court the japan court under the corporate reorganization act of japan on february 27 2012 and the japan court issued an order to commence the reorganization proceedings the japan proceedings on march 23 2012 on july 2 2012 we entered into the sponsor agreement with the legal trustees of the elpida companies and the japan court approved the sponsor agreement under the sponsor agreement we agreed to provide certain support for the reorganization of the elpida companies and the trustees agreed to prepare and seek approval from the japan court and the elpida companies creditors of plans of reorganization consistent with such support 

 23 

the trustees initially submitted the proposed plans of reorganization for the elpida companies to the japan court on august 21 2012 and submitted final proposed plans on october 29 2012 on october 31 2012 the japan court approved submission of the trustees proposed plans of reorganization to creditors for approval on february 26 2013 the elpida companies creditors approved the reorganization plans and on february 28 2013 the japan court issued an order approving the plans of reorganization appeals filed by certain creditors of elpida in japan challenging the plan approval order issued by the japan court were denied 

in a related action elpida filed a verified petition for recognition and chapter 15 relief in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the us court on march 19 2012 and on april 24 2012 the us court entered an order that among other things recognized elpidas corporate reorganization proceeding as a foreign main proceeding pursuant to 11 usc § 1517b on june 25 2013 the us court issued a recognition order which recognized the order of the japan court approving elpidas plan of reorganization 

the plans of reorganization provide for payments by the elpida companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen or the equivalent of approximately 205 billion  as of august 29 2013  less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items the plans of reorganization also provided for the investment by us pursuant to the sponsor agreement of 60 billion yen  615 million  paid at closing in cash into elpida in exchange for 100 ownership of elpidas equity and the use of such investment to fund the initial installment payment by the elpida companies to their creditors of 60 billion yen subject to reduction for certain items specified in the sponsor agreement and plans of reorganization the initial installment payment was made to the creditors of the elpida companies in october 2013 the plans of reorganization also provide for 140 billion yen or the equivalent of approximately 143 billion as of august 29 2013  of additional payments by the elpida companies to their creditors to be paid in six annual installments beginning december 2014 with payments of 20 billion yen or the equivalent of approximately 205 million as of august 29 2013  in each of the first four annual installment payments and payments of 30 billion yen or the equivalent of approximately 307 million as of august 29 2013  in each of the final two annual installment payments 

under the sponsor agreement we agreed that we would subject to certain conditions implement and maintain a cost plus model with the elpida companies in support of the execution of their plans of reorganization in connection with these commitments we entered into a series of costplus agreements with elpida and akita including supply agreements research and development services agreements and general services agreements the cost plus agreements the cost plus agreements are intended to generate more stable operating cash flows to meet the requirements of the elpida companies businesses including the funding of the installment payments to the elpida companies creditors we anticipate that once fully in effect payments we make under the cost plus agreements will generally cover all of elpida and akitas costs 

under elpidas plan of reorganization secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their fixed claims and unsecured creditors will recover at least 174 of the amount of their fixed claims the actual recovery of unsecured creditors will be higher however based in part on events and circumstances occurring following the plan approval the remaining portion of the unsecured claims will be discharged without payment over the period that payments are made pursuant to the plans of reorganization the secured creditors will be paid in full on or before the sixth installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments akitas plan of reorganization provides that secured creditors will recover 100 of the amount of their claims whereas unsecured creditors will recover 19 of the amount of their claims the secured creditors of akita will be paid in full on the first installment payment date while the unsecured creditors will be paid in seven installments 

certain contingency matters related to the elpida companies which are primarily comprised of outstanding litigation claims were not treated as fixed claims under the plans of reorganization at the time the plans were filed with the japan court a portion of each installment amount payable to the creditors of the elpida companies will be reserved for use in the event that any of these matters become fixed claims in which case these fixed claims will be paid under the plans of reorganization in the same manner as the fixed claims of other creditors to the extent the aggregate amounts reserved from the installment payments exceed the aggregate amounts payable with respect to these unfixed claims once they become fixed the excess amounts reserved will be distributed to unsecured creditors with respect to their fixed claims resulting in an increased recovery for the unsecured creditors out of the installment payments to the extent the aggregate amounts reserved are less than the aggregate amounts payable with respect to these unfixed claims once they become fixed the elpida companies would be responsible to fund any shortfall to ensure that the creditors receive the minimum recovery to which they are entitled under the plans of reorganization with respect to these claims as a result there is a possibility that the total amount payable by the elpida companies to their creditors under the plans of reorganization will exceed 200 billion yen in addition certain of these unfixed claims may be resolved pursuant to settlement arrangements or other postpetition agreements and a substantial portion of the amounts payable under such agreements may have to be funded by the elpida companies outside of the plans of reorganization 

 24 

because the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies provide for ongoing payments to creditors following the closing of the elpida acquisition the japan proceedings are continuing and the elpida companies remain subject to the oversight of the japan court and of the trustees including a trustee designated by us who we refer to as the business trustee and a trustee designated by the japan court who we refer to as the legal trustee pending completion of the reorganization proceedings the business trustee will make decisions in relation to the operation of the businesses of the elpida companies other than decisions in relation to acts that need to be carried out in connection with the japan proceedings which will be the responsibility of the legal trustee the japan proceedings and oversight of the japan court will continue until the final creditor payment is made under the elpida companies plans of reorganization which is scheduled to occur in december 2019 but may occur on a later date to the extent any claims of creditors remain unfixed on the final scheduled installment payment date the elpida companies may petition the japan court for an early termination of the japan proceedings once twothirds of all payments under the plans of reorganization are made although such early terminations are customarily granted there can be no assurance that the japan court will grant any such petition in these particular cases 

during the pendency of the japan proceedings the elpida companies are obligated to provide periodic financial reports to the japan court and may be required to obtain the consent of the japan court prior to taking a number of significant actions relating to their businesses including transferring or disposing of or acquiring certain material assets incurring or guaranteeing material indebtedness settling material disputes or entering into certain material agreements the consent of the legal trustee may also be required for matters that would likely have a material impact on the operations or assets of the elpida companies and their subsidiaries or for transfers of material assets to the extent the matters or transfers would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect execution of the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies accordingly during the pendency of the japan proceedings our ability to effectively integrate the elpida companies as part of our global operations or to cause the elpida companies to take certain actions that we deem advisable for their businesses could be adversely affected if the japan court or the legal trustee is unwilling to consent to various actions that we may wish to take with respect to the elpida companies

overview 

for an overview of our business see item 1 – business – overview our results of operations for 2013 were affected by the following key transactions and events 

acquisition of elpida memory inc 

on july 31 2013 we completed our acquisition of elpida memory inc elpida a japanese corporation pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement on support for reorganization companies as amended the sponsor agreement that we entered into on july 2 2012 with the trustees of elpida and one of its subsidiaries akita elpida memory inc a japanese corporation akita and together with elpida the elpida companies pursuant to and in connection with the elpida companies pending corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan we paid 615 million for the acquisition of 100 of elpidas equity on july 31 2013 we also acquired a 24 ownership interest in rexchip electronics corporation rexchip a taiwanese corporation and manufacturing joint venture formed by powerchip technology corporation powerchip and elpida from powerchip and certain of its affiliates the powerchip group pursuant to a share purchase agreement we paid 334 million in cash for the shares elpida and its subsidiaries the elpida group own approximately 65 of rexchips outstanding common stock therefore as a result of the consummation of our acquisition of elpida and the rexchip shares from the powerchip group we own approximately 89 of rexchips common stock the provisional fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include among other items cash and restricted cash aggregating 1618 million inventories of 962 million property plant and equipment of 935 million net deferred tax assets of 917 million and debt of 2134 million 

elpidas assets include among others a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in hiroshima japan its ownership interest in rexchip whose assets include a 300mm dram wafer fabrication facility located in taichung city taiwan and an assembly and test facility located in akita japan the elpida and rexchip fabrication facilities together represent approximately onethird of our wafer capacity 

elpidas semiconductor memory products include mobile dram targeted toward mobile phones and tablets we believe that combining the complementary product portfolios of micron and elpida strengthens our position in the memory market and enables us to provide customers with a wider portfolio of highquality memory solutions we also believe that the elpida transaction strengthens our market position in the memory industry through increased research and development and manufacturing scale improved access to core memory market segments and additional wafer capacity to balance among our dram nand flash and nor flash memory solutions elpidas operations are included primarily in the dsg and wsg segments our results of operations for 2013 included approximately one month of operating results from the elpida operations which accounted for sales of 355 million and net income of 29 million 

the elpida companies are currently subject to corporate reorganization proceedings under the corporate reorganization act of japan both of the elpida companies have adopted plans of reorganization which set forth the treatment of the elpida companies prepetition creditors and their claims which plans were approved by the elpida companies creditors and the tokyo district court in february 2013 the plans of reorganization provide for payments by the elpida companies to their secured and unsecured creditors in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen or the equivalent of approximately 205 billion as of august 29 2013 less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items the plans of reorganization provide for the elpida companies prepetition creditors to be paid in seven installments the initial installment payment of 60 billion  yen  615 million  as of august 29 2013 which amount is subject to reduction for certain items specified in the sponsor agreement and plans of reorganization was paid in october 2013 substantially all of the 615 million  that we paid in connection with the elpida acquisition was deposited into accounts that are legally restricted for payment to the secured and unsecured creditors of elpida in october 2013 and was presented as restricted cash in the amount of 556 million on our august 29 2013 balance sheet the remaining 140 billion yen or the equivalent of approximately 143 billion as of august 29 2013 of installment payments payable to the elpida companies creditors are scheduled to be made by the elpida companies in six annual installments payable beginning on december 31 2014 pursuant to the terms of the sponsor agreement we entered into a series of agreements with the elpida companies including supply agreements research and development services agreements and general services agreements which are intended to generate more stable operating cash flows to meet the requirements of the elpida companies businesses including the funding of the installment payments to the elpida companies creditors we anticipate that once fully in effect payments made under these agreements will generally cover all of elpida and akitas costs 

 35 

to mitigate the risk from the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the proposed elpida acquisition we entered into a series of currency exchange contracts to hedge our exposure to yen and new taiwan dollar payments the elpida hedges these currency exchange contracts were not designated for hedge accounting and were remeasured at fair value each period with gains and losses recognized in other operating income expense as a result of marktomarket adjustments for the elpida hedges we recorded losses to other nonoperating expense of 228 million in 2013 as of august 29 2013 our cumulative loss on the elpida hedges was 220 million

total net sales for 2013 increased 10 as compared to 2012 reflecting increases in dsg esg and wsg sales primarily due to higher levels of dram and nand flash gigabit sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices the increases in gigabit sales volumes for 2013 were primarily attributable to manufacturing efficiencies driven by improvements in product and process technology increased dram supply from inotera due to the restructuring of our supply agreement and 355 million of dram sales from elpida since its acquisition on july 31 2013 

total net sales decreased 6 for 2012 as compared to 2011 reflecting declines in average selling prices across all reportable segments partially offset by increases in sales volumes wsg sales decreased for 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to declines in average selling prices and in nor flash sales volumes as a result of weakness in market demand and our customer group in particular as well as a continued transition by customers from nor flash to nand flash dsg sales decreased primarily due to lower average selling prices partially offset by increases in sales volumes nsg and esg sales increased due to increases in sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices 

sales for all other segments were primarily composed of sales of cmos image sensors on may 3 2013 we sold micron technology italia srl mit a whollyowned subsidiary including its 200mm wafer fabrication facility assets in avezzano italy to lfoundry marsica srl lfoundry in connection with the sale we assigned to lfoundry our supply agreement with aptina imaging corporation aptina for cmos image sensors manufactured at the avezzano facility since the sale we have had no sales of cmos image sensors for 2013 2012 and 2011 we recognized net sales of 182 million  372 million  and 349 million  respectively from products sold to aptina and cost of goods sold of 219 million  395 million  and 358 million  respectively see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – restructure and asset impairments 

gross margin 

our overall gross margin percentage improved to 20 for 2013 from 12 for 2012 due to improvements in the gross margin percentage for dsg and to a lesser extent wsg esg and nsg primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions partially offset by declines in average selling prices manufacturing cost reductions for 2013 primarily resulted from improvements in product and process technologies 

our overall gross margin percentage declined to 12 for 2012 from 20 for 2011 primarily due to decreases in the gross margin percentage for dsg and wsg as a result of significant declines in average selling prices cost reductions from improvements in product and process technologies in 2012 mitigated the effect of significant declines in average selling prices for all reportable operating segments

wireless solutions group wsg 



in 2013 wsg sales were comprised primarily of dram nand flash and nor flash in decreasing order of revenue wsg sales increased 3 for 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to higher sales of mobile dram products as a result of the acquisition of elpida we expect that wsg sales of mobile dram products will increase significantly in 2014 primarily due to our acquisition of elpida wsg results of operations for 2013 included sales of 192 million and operating income of 21 million from the acquired elpida operations increases in wsg sales for 2013 from mobile dram were partially offset by declines in sales of wireless nor flash products as a result of weakness in market demand and our customer group in particular as well as a continued transition by customers to nand flash wsg sales in 2013 were also adversely impacted by lower sales of nand flash products sold in multichip packages the improvement in wsg operating margin for 2013 was primarily due to reductions in manufacturing sga and rd costs 

in 2012 wsg sales were comprised of nor flash nand flash and dram in decreasing order of revenue the 40 decrease in wsg sales for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to declines in sales of wireless nor flash products as a result of weakness in market demand and our customer group in particular as well as a continued transition by customers to nand flash wsg sales in 2012 were also adversely impacted by lower sales of nand flash products sold in multichip packages the decline in wsg operating margin for 2012 was primarily due to the reductions in average selling prices and in nor flash sales volumes in addition wsg operating margin for 2011 benefited from a 95 million gain from an allocated portion of the samsung patent crosslicense agreement 

embedded solutions group esg 



in 2013 esg sales were comprised of nor flash dram and nand flash in decreasing order of revenue esg sales increased 13 for 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to increased sales volume of nand flash dram and nor flash products as esg continued to expand its customer base partially offset by declines in average selling prices esg operating income for 2013 improved from 2012 primarily due to higher gross margins as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices 

in 2012 esg sales were comprised of nor flash dram and nand flash in decreasing order of revenue the 5 increase in esg sales for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to increased sales volume of dram nand flash and nor flash products as esg continued to expand its customer base partially offset by declines in average selling prices esg operating income for 2012 declined as compared to 2011 due to decreases in average selling prices and higher costs associated with underutilized capacity in our nor flash facilities in addition esg operating margin for 2011 benefited from a 33 million gain from an allocated portion of the samsung patent crosslicense agreement

operating results by product 

net sales by product 



in order to balance our future product mix in anticipation of the closing of the elpida transaction in the fourth quarter of 2013 we began to transition production at our dram fabrication facility in singapore from dram to nand flash we expect this transition to nand flash production will occur over approximately four quarters depending on market conditions and result in a marginal reduction in wafer production during the period of this transition 

dram 



the increase in gigabit sales of dram products for 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to increased output obtained from our inotera joint venture under the new supply agreement improved product and process technologies and the acquisition of elpida on july 31 2013 effective on january 1 2013 we entered into the new inotera supply agreement under which we purchase substantially all of inoteras output at a purchase price based on a discount from market prices for our comparable components prior to the new inotera supply agreement we had the right to purchase 50 of inoteras wafer production capacity based on a marginsharing formula among nanya inotera and us see overview – inotera memories inc our cost of product purchased from inotera under these supply agreements was 1260 million  for 2013 646 million  for 2012 and 641 million  for 2011 our cost of product purchased from inotera has increased since the beginning of calendar 2013 and was higher than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities in the fourth quarter of 2013 

dram products acquired from inotera accounted for 54 of our dram gigabit production for 2013 as compared to 46 for 2012 and 33 for 2011 as of june 30 2013 inoteras current liabilities exceeded its current assets by 10 billion  which exposes inotera to liquidity risk additionally inotera incurred net losses of 541 million  for its fiscal year ended december 31 2012 as of june 30 2013 inotera was not in compliance with certain of its loan covenants and had not been in compliance for the past several years which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year inotera has applied for a waiver from complying with the june 30 2013 financial covenants inoteras management has implemented plans to improve its liquidity and for inoteras sixmonth period ended june 30 2013 inotera generated net income of 91 million  however there can be no assurance that inotera will be successful in sufficiently improving its liquidity and complying with their loan covenants which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year 

our gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2013 improved from 2012 primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions as a result of improvements in product and process technology partially offset by declines in average selling prices dram sales and gross margins for 2012 were adversely impacted by the effects of the 58 million charge to revenue for a settlement with a customer 

 40 

we expect that our gigabit production and sales volumes of dram products will increase significantly in 2014 due to our acquisition of elpida elpida has 300mm wafer fabrication facilities in japan and taiwan that are dedicated to the production of dram products we expect that dram products produced by the acquired elpida facilities will constitute over half of our aggregate dram gigabit production in the first quarter of 2014 and result in significant increases in dsg and wsg dram sales in accounting for the elpida acquisition elpidas inventories were recorded at fair value based on their estimated future selling prices estimated costs to complete and other factors which was approximately 200 million higher than the cost of inventory recorded by elpida prior to the acquisition of this amount approximately 40 million was included in cost of goods sold for 2013 and a significant portion of the reminder is expected to be included in costs of goods sold in the first quarter of 2014 

nand flash 

we sell a portion of our output of nand flash products to intel through im flash at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost see operating results by business segments – nand solutions group for further detail we sell the remainder of our nand flash products to trade customers 



increases in nand flash gigabits sold to trade customers for 2013 as compared to 2012 were primarily due to improved product and process technologies increased output available for sale to trade customers due to the restructure of our im flash agreement with intel in april 2012 and the rampup of our fabrication facility in singapore throughout 2012 our gross margin percentage on sales of nand flash products for 2013 improved from 2012 as manufacturing cost reductions outpaced declines in average selling prices manufacturing cost reductions for 2013 as compared to 2012 reflect improvements in product and process technologies 

increases in nand flash gigabits sold to trade customers for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to the ramp of the imfs fabrication facility and improved product and process technologies the new costplus supply agreement with intel also contributed to the increase in gigabits sold to trade customers for 2012 

nor flash 

sales of nor flash products for 2013 declined as compared to 2012 primarily due to decreases in sales of wireless products as a result of weakness in demand from certain customers and the continued transition of wireless applications to nand flash products which led to significant declines in average selling prices our gross margin percentage on sales of nor flash products for 2013 improved as compared to 2012 primarily due to cost reductions 

sales of nor flash products for 2012 declined from 2011 primarily due to decreases in sales of wireless nor flash products as a result of weakness in demand from certain customers and the continued transition of wireless applications to nand flash products that led to significant declines in average selling prices and sales volume our gross margin percentage on sales of nor flash products declined from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to decreases in average selling prices inventory writedowns and costs of underutilized capacity 

operating expenses and other 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative sga expenses for 2013 decreased 9 as compared to 2012 primarily due to a reduction in legal costs and lower variable pay costs partially offset by 50 million  of consulting legal and other costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of elpida 

 41 

sga expenses for 2012 increased 5 as compared to 2011 primarily due to a 13 million contribution to a university program and stockbased compensation and other amounts related to the death benefits of our former chief executive officer in 2012 we expect that sga expenses will approximate 185 million to 195 million for the first quarter of 2014 which includes costs from elpida 

research and development 

rd expenses for 2013 increased 1 from 2012 primarily due to lower reimbursements from nanya under partnering arrangements offset by lower payroll costs primarily resulting from the suspension of variable pay plans and a lower volume of development wafers processed 

rd expenses for 2012 increased 16 from 2011 primarily due to a higher volume of development wafers processed higher personnel costs associated with increased salary and wage rates and additional headcount for our expanded rd operations and higher software and materials costs 

as a result of amounts reimbursable from nanya under a dram rd costsharing arrangement rd expenses were reduced by 19 million  138 million  and 141 million  for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the april 6 2012  agreements with intel expanded our nand flash rd costsharing agreement to include certain emerging memory technologies but did not change the costsharing percentage as a result of amounts reimbursable from intel rd expenses were reduced by 127 million  87 million  and 95 million  for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively effective january 1 2013 nanya ceased participating in the joint development program we expect that rd expenses net of amounts reimbursable from our rd partners will be approximately 340 million to 350 million for the first quarter of 2014 which includes costs from elpida 

our process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram and mobile low power ddr dram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including multilevel and triplelevel cell technologies nor flash memory specialty memory solidstate drives hybrid memory cubes and other memory technologies and systems 

restructure and asset impairments 



we have taken actions to dispose of 200mm wafer manufacturing facilities and optimize operations including our workforce for 2013 esg wsg nsg and dsg recognized restructure and impairment costs of 12 million  11 million  11 million  and 6 million  respectively the remaining restructure and impairment costs for 2013 were allocated to segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment and are reported under all other as of august 29 2013 the only significant remaining amount accrued but unpaid for these restructure activities was 12 million related to workforce optimization as of august 29 2013 we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional costs for these restructure activities see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – restructure and asset impairments 

interest income expense 

interest expense for 2013  2012  and 2011 included aggregate amounts of amortization of debt discount and other interest amortization expense of 120 million 95 million and 60 million respectively see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – debt note

equity in net loss of equity method investees 

we recognize our share of earnings or losses from these entities under the equity method generally on a twomonth lag equity in net loss of equity method investees net of tax included the following 



our equity in net income loss of inotera improved for 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to inoteras improved operating results as a result of higher average selling prices and lower manufacturing costs on may 28 2013 inotera issued 634 million common shares to nanya and certain of its affiliates in a private placement at a price equal to 947 new taiwan dollars per common share approximately 032 us dollars as of may 28 2013 which was in excess of our carrying value per share as a result of the issuance our ownership interest decreased from 40 to 35  and we recognized a gain of approximately 48 million in 2013 the change in ownership interest does not change our obligation to purchase substantially all of inoteras output losses in 2012 for our other equity method investments were primarily attributable to transform solar pty ltd which ceased operations in 2012 and has essentially been liquidated see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – equity method investments

fair values – elpida acquisition 

the provisional fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in the acquisition of elpida is based on estimates using information available at the closing of the acquisition we estimated the provisional fair value of the assets and liabilities of elpida as of july 31 2013 using an inuse model which reflects its value through its use in combination with other assets as a group these provisional amounts could change as additional information become available these changes could result in material variances between the combined entitys future financial results including variances in fair values recorded as well as expenses associated with these items 

determination of provisional fair values for the assets and liabilities acquired in the elpida acquisition required significant assumptions estimates and judgments many of the measurements involved significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a level 3 measurement as defined in asc 820 changes in assumptions estimates and judgments could significantly impact the asset and liabilities recorded as well as the gain recognized in the acquisition the items involving the most significant assumptions estimates and judgments included determining the fair value of the following

liquidity and capital resources 



cash and equivalents in the table above included 1094 million held by elpida and its subsidiaries as of august 29 2013  substantially all of the restricted cash in the table above is held by elpida for its installment payments to its secured and unsecured creditors use of cash and equivalents and restricted cash held by elpida is subject to limitations described below 

as a result of the japan proceedings for so long as such proceedings are continuing the elpida companies and their subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions on dividends loans and advances the plans of reorganization of the elpida companies prohibit the elpida companies from paying dividends including any cash dividends to us and require that excess earnings be used in their businesses or to fund the elpida companies installment payments these prohibitions would also effectively prevent the subsidiaries of the elpida companies from paying cash dividends to us as any such dividends would have to be first paid to the elpida companies which are prohibited from repaying those amounts to us as dividends under the plans of reorganization in addition pursuant to an order of the japan court the elpida companies cannot make loans or advances other than certain ordinary course advances to us without the consent of the japan court moreover loans or advances by subsidiaries of the elpida companies may be considered outside of the ordinary course of business and subject to approval of the legal trustees and japan court as a result the assets of the elpida companies and their subsidiaries while available to satisfy the elpida companies installment payments and the other obligations capital expenditures and other operating needs of the elpida companies and their subsidiaries are not available for use by us in our other operations moreover certain uses of the assets of the elpida companies including investments in certain capital expenditures and in rexchip may require consent of elpidas trustees andor the japan court see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – acquisition of elpida memory inc 

cash and equivalents in the table above included 62 million  held by imft as of august 29 2013  and 157 million  as of august 30 2012  our ability to access funds held by imft to finance our other operations is subject to agreement by the other member and contractual limitations amounts held by imft are not anticipated to be available to finance our other operations 

as of august 29 2013  1598 million of our cash and equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries of which 743 million was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as of august 29 2013  we had 1362 million of cash and equivalents including the 1094 million at elpida that was held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and repatriation of these funds to the us would subject these funds to us federal income taxes 

to mitigate credit risk we invest through highcreditquality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor 

 44 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity our liquidity is highly dependent on selling prices for our products and the timing and level of our capital expenditures both of which can vary significantly from period to period depending on conditions in the semiconductor memory market our cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash and investments may not be adequate to meet our needs for capital expenditures and operations in 2013 we obtained 1121 million  of proceeds from issuance of debt and 126 million  of proceeds from equipment saleleaseback financing as of august 29 2013 we had credit facilities available that provides for up to 408 million of additional financing subject to outstanding balances of trade receivables and other conditions see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – debt – revolving credit facilities we have in the past and expect in the future to continue to incur additional debt to finance our capital investments including debt incurred in connection with assetbacked financing we expect our cash and investments cash flows from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through 2014 

holders of our outstanding convertible notes can convert the notes during any calendar quarter if the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is more than 130 of the conversion price as of august 29 2013 convertible notes with an aggregate principal amount of 1465 million contained contractual terms that require us to pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes upon conversion these notes become convertible at the option of the holders if the closing price of our common stock for the required periods is above prices ranging from 1235 to 1421 none of these convertible notes met the conversion criteria through the calendar quarter ended june 30 2013 of the notes that require us to pay cash up to the principal amount upon conversion only the 2031a and 2031b notes with an aggregate principle amount of 690 million and carrying value of 530 million as of august 29 2013 met the conversion criteria during september 2013 through october 28 2013 none of the 2031a or 2031b notes had been converted by holders we do not believe the amounts converted if any would be significant since the note holders would forgo the time value of the embedded conversion option we may elect in future periods to redeem convertible notes eligible for redemption 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1811 million  for 2013 which reflected approximately 2177 million generated from the production and sales of our products net of a 366 million effect from increases in the amount invested in net working capital the increase in net working capital was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of 409 million as a result of increases in sales activities

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

business acquisitions  accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized accounting for acquisitions can also involve significant judgment to determine when control of the acquired entity is transferred we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values the items involving the most significant assumptions estimates and judgments included determining the fair value of the following 

 

consolidations  we have interests in joint venture entities that are variable interest entities vies determining whether to consolidate a vie may require judgment in assessing 1 whether an entity is a vie and 2 if we are the entitys primary beneficiary to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we evaluate whether we have a the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding and financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies requires significant assumptions and judgment 

contingencies  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 

income taxes  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 

 49 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value cost includes labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated market values below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated market value of our memory inventory by approximately 154 million as of august 29 2013 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories our inventories have been generally categorized as dram nand flash and nor flash memory the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 

property plant and equipment  we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

research and development  costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are valued in inventory 

stockbased compensation    stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fairvalue of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgment 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock 

recently issued accounting standards 

there have been no recently issued accounting pronouncements that have had or are expected to have a material impact on our financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our indebtedness and our investment portfolio substantially all of our indebtedness was at fixed interest rates as a result the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates we estimate that as of august 29 2013  and august 30 2012 a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates of 1 would increase the fair value of our convertible notes and other notes by approximately 147 million  and 88 million respectively the increase in interest expense caused by a 1 increase in the interest rates of our variablerate note would not be significant 

as of august 29 2013  and august 30 2012 we held debt securities of 787 million  and 464 million respectively that were subject to interest rate risk we estimate that a 05 increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of these instruments by approximately 4 million  as of august 29 2013  and 3 million as of august 30 2012 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in item 1a risk factors changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the functional currency for all of our operations is the us dollar as a result of our foreign operations we incur costs and carry certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies the substantial majority of our revenues are transacted in the us dollar however significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro the shekel the yen and the yuan we have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates we utilize currency forward and option contracts in these hedging programs our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

to hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities we utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities offset by balance sheet hedges we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately us 19 million  as of august 29 2013  and us 8 million  as of august 30 2012  to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures and forecasted operating cash flows we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months and currency options that generally mature from 12 to 18 months 

under the terms and conditions of the elpida companies respective plans of reorganization the elpida companies are obligated to pay 200 billion  yen or the equivalent of  205 billion  based on exchange rates as of august 29 2013 less certain expenses of their reorganization proceedings and certain other items to the secured and unsecured creditors the elpida creditor installment payments in respect of the elpida companies prepetition creditors and their related claims substantially all of the 615 million  we paid in connection with the acquisition of elpida was deposited into accounts that are legally restricted for payment to the secured and unsecured creditors of elpida in october 2013 the remaining 140 billion  yen is due in six  annual installments payable at the end of each calendar year beginning in 2014 with payments of 20 billion  yen in each of 2014 through 2017 and payments of 30 billion  yen in each of 2018 and 2019 to mitigate the risk that increases in exchange rates have on the payments due in 2014 and 2015 we entered into forward contracts to purchase 20 billion yen on november 28 2014 and 10 billion yen on november 27 2015 in addition the elpida companies cash and equivalent balances in yen mitigate the foreign currency exchange risk associated with the yen remaining installment payments due in 2015 and after see item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – debt changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the yen could have a significant impact on our financial statements

our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process linewidth number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment we continuously enhance our production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in 2012 most of our nand flash memory products were manufactured on our 25nm linewidth process technology we expect that for the second half of 2013 a majority of our nand flash production will be manufactured on our 20nm linewidth process technology in 2012 the majority of our dram production was manufactured on 42nm linewidth process technology we expect that for 2013 the majority of our dram production will be manufactured on 30nm linewidth process technology our nor flash memory products in 2012 were manufactured on our 65nm and 45nm linewidth process technologies in 2012 we manufactured all of our highvolume nand flash and dram products on 300mm wafers we manufactured nor flash some specialty dram and cmos image sensor products on 200mm wafers in 2012 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

after fabrication most silicon wafers are separated into individual die we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie bare die forms for packaged products functional die are sorted connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages we assemble products in a variety of packages including tsop thin small outline package tqfp thin quad flat package and fbga fine pitch ball grid array bare die products address customer requirements for smaller form factors and higher memory densities and provide superior flexibility for use in packaging technologies such as systeminapackage sips and mcps which reduce the board area required 

we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process perform high temperature burnin on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition we use our proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

we assemble a significant portion of our memory products into memory modules memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards that insert directly into computer systems or other electronic devices we also contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture nand flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices 

we utilize subcontractors to perform a portion of our assembly and module assembly services outsourcing these services enables us to reduce costs and minimize our capital investment 

in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing process although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 

availability of raw materials 

our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

marketing and customers 

our products are sold into computing consumer networking telecommunications automotive industrial and mobile markets market concentrations from 2012 net sales were approximately as follows computing including desktop pcs servers notebooks and workstations 25  consumer electronics 20  mobile 15  networking and storage 10  and ssds 10 sales to intel primarily nand flash products through im flash were 12  of our net sales in 2012 10  of our net sales in 2011 and 9 of our net sales in 2010 sales to hewlettpackard company primarily of dram were 8 of our net sales in 2012 9 of our net sales in 2011 and 13 of our net sales in 2010 

our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron lexar® crucial™ spectek® and numonyx® brand names and private labels we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world we sell lexarbranded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucialbranded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several months 

backlog 

because of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

product warranty 

because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery under our general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions 

competition 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including elpida memory inc samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation sk hynix inc spansion inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices many of our highvolume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors for these highvolume memory products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factors for our other memory products the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence to pricing 

research and development 

our process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram and mobile low power ddr dram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including mlc and tlc technologies nor flash memory specialty memory phasechange memory ssds and other memory technologies and systems 

our rd expenses were 918 million 791 million and 624 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively we generally share rd process and design costs for nand flash with intel and for dram with nanya we also share rd costs for certain emerging memory technologies with intel as a result of reimbursements under our intel and nanya costsharing arrangements our overall rd expenses were reduced by 225 million 236 million and 155 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

to compete in the semiconductor memory industry we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions our process development center and largest design center are located at our corporate headquarters in boise idaho in 2012 we commenced operation of our new rd facility in boise which was designed to accommodate 450mm wafer manufacturing we have several additional product design centers in other strategic locations around the world in addition we develop photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boise 

rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make onetime or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

in recent years we have recovered some of our investment in technology through sales or licenses of intellectual property rights to joint venture partners and other third parties we are pursuing additional opportunities to recover our investment in intellectual property through additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and potential partnering arrangements 

employees 

as of august 30 2012 we had approximately 27400 employees of which approximately 16000 were outside the united states including approximately 7800 in singapore 3400 in italy 2200 in china 1100 in israel and 1000 in malaysia our employees include approximately 1600 in our imft joint venture primarily located in the united states our employment levels can vary depending on market conditions and the level of our production research and product and process development many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success depends in part upon our ability to attract and retain such employees the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

environmental compliance 

government regulations impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges emissions and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes in 2012 our whollyowned wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of iso 14001 certification to continue certification we met annual requirements in environmental policy compliance planning management structure and responsibility training communication document control operational control emergency preparedness and response record keeping and management review while we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures modification of our operations or other compliance actions

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of us 

we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business 

if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices per gigabit in recent years as noted in the table below and may continue to experience such decreases in the future in some prior periods average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs and we may experience such circumstances in the future 



we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at the rate average selling prices decline 

our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes including reducing the die size of our existing products in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to improve or maintain gross margins factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes difficulty in transitioning to smaller linewidth process technologies technological barriers and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products 

the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including elpida memory inc samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation sk hynix inc spansion inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs transitions to smaller linewidth process technologies and product and process improvements have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the european financial crisis and overall downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business 

  

the european financial crisis and the overall downturn in the worldwide economy have had an adverse effect on our business a continuation or further deterioration of depressed economic conditions could have an even greater adverse effect on our business adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers networking products and mobile devices reduced demand for these products could result in significant decreases in our average selling prices a continuation of current negative conditions in worldwide credit markets would limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of loss on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

inoteras financial situation may adversely impact the value of our interest and our supply agreement 

due to significant market declines in the selling prices of dram inotera incurred net losses of 259 million  for its sixmonth period ended june 30 2012 and 737 million for its fiscal year ended december 31 2011 under generally accepted accounting principles in the republic of china inotera reported a loss for its quarter ended september 30 2012 of an additional new taiwan dollars 4390 million approximately 150 million us dollars in addition inoteras current liabilities exceeded its current assets by 185 billion  as of june 30 2012 which exposes inotera to liquidity risk as of june 30 2012 and december 31 2011 inotera was also not in compliance with certain loan covenants and had not been in compliance for the past several years which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year inotera obtained a waiver from complying with its financial covenants through june 30 2012 and has requested an additional waiver from these requirements inoteras management has developed plans to improve its liquidity there can be no assurance that inotera will be successful in obtaining an additional waiver or improving its liquidity if inotera is unable to adequately improve its liquidity we may have to impair our investment in inotera which had a net carrying value of 321 million  as of august 30 2012  

in the second quarter of 2012 we contributed 170 million  to inotera which increased our ownership percentage from 297 to 397  we may not continue to make equity contributions to inotera which may further increase their liquidity risk we have a supply agreement with inotera under which nanya is also a party for the rights and obligations to purchase 50  of inoteras wafer production capacity the inotera supply agreement as a result of our march 7 2012 equity contribution to inotera we expect to receive a higher share of inoteras 30nanometer output when it becomes available as a result of inotera capital investments enabled by our 170 million  equity investment in the fourth quarter of 2012 we purchased 170 million  of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 47 of our aggregate dram gigabit production as a result if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks 

our inotera supply agreement involves numerous risks including the following 

 

we may make future acquisitions andor alliances which involve numerous risks 

acquisitions and the formation or operation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 

 

in recent years supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices of dram nand flash and nor flash products resulting operating losses have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants including the liquidation of qimonda ag and the recent bankruptcy filing by elpida memory inc these types of proceedings often lead to confidential courtdirected processes involving the sale of related businesses or assets we believe the global memory industry is experiencing a period of consolidation as a result of these market conditions and other factors and we have engaged and expect to continue to engage in discussions regarding potential acquisitions and similar opportunities arising out of these industry conditions such as our pending acquisition of elpida to the extent we are successful in completing any such transactions we could be subject to some or all of the risks described above including the risks pertaining to funding assumption of liabilities integration challenges and increases in debt that may accompany such transactions acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our pending acquisitions of elpida and rexchip involve numerous risks 

on july 2 2012 we entered into a sponsor agreement with the trustees of the elpida companies that provides for among other things our acquisition of 100 of the equity of elpida under the sponsor agreement we committed to support plans of reorganization for the elpida companies that would provide for payments to the secured and unsecured creditors of the elpida companies in an aggregate amount of 200 billion  yen or approximately 25 billion  less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items as a condition of the sponsor agreement we deposited 18 billion yen or approximately 23 million into an escrow account in july 2012 which will be applied to the share acquisition payments at closing of the aggregate amount we will fund 60 billion  yen or approximately 750 million  through a cash payment to elpida at the closing in exchange for 100  ownership of elpidas equity the remaining 140 billion  yen or approximately 175 billion  of payments will be made by the elpida companies in six  annual installments payable at the end of each calendar year beginning in 2014 with payments of 20 billion  yen or approximately 250 million  in each of 2014 through 2017 and payments of 30 billion  yen or approximately 375 million  in each of 2018 and 2019 

on that same date we entered into a share purchase agreement with powerchip and certain of its affiliates under which we will purchase approximately 714 million shares of the common stock of rexchip a manufacturing joint venture formed by elpida and powerchip for approximately 10 billion  new taiwan dollars or approximately 334 million  if the transactions contemplated by these two agreements are completed we will own 100 of elpida and directly or indirectly through elpida approximately 89 of rexchip 

there can be no assurance that these transactions will close when expected or at all or that the acquisition of elpida will ultimately be consummated on the terms and conditions set forth in the sponsor agreement the transactions remain subject to bankruptcy andor regulatory approval in various jurisdictions including the peoples republic of china these regulatory authorities may not approve the transactions or may impose modifications conditions or restrictions that adversely impact the value of the transactions to micron in addition the proposed plan of reorganization of the trustees which contemplates microns acquisition of elpida pursuant to the sponsor agreement remains subject to approval of both the court and the creditors of elpida neither of which can be assured various creditors are challenging the trustees proposed plan of reorganization and certain creditors have proposed an alternative plan of reorganization that does not contemplate microns acquisition of elpida if the requisite court and creditor approvals are not obtained micron will not be able to close the acquisitions 

in addition to the risks described in the immediately preceding risk factor relating to acquisitions generally and to microns ability to consummate the transaction described in the preceding paragraph these acquisitions are expected to involve the following significant risks 

 

our pending acquisitions of elpida and rexchip are inherently risky may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our pending acquisitions of elpida and rexchip expose us to significant risks from changes in currency exchange rates 

under the sponsor agreement we committed to support plans of reorganization for elpida that would provide for payments to the secured and unsecured creditors of elpida in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen also under the share purchase agreement with powerchip we agreed to pay approximately 10 billion new taiwan dollars to purchase approximately 714 million shares of rexchip common stock these payments in yen and new taiwan dollars expose us to significant risks from changes in currency exchange rates 

on july 2 2012 we executed a series of separate currency exchange transactions pursuant to which we purchased call options to buy 200 billion  yen with a weightedaverage strike price of 7915  yen per dollar in addition to reduce the cost of these call options we sold put options to sell 100 billion  yen with a strike price of 8332  and we sold call options to buy 100 billion  yen with a strike price of 7557  the net cost of these call and put options which expire on april 3 2013 of 49 million  is payable upon settlement these currency options mitigate the risk of a strengthening yen for our yendenominated payments under the sponsor agreement while preserving some ability for us to benefit if the value of the yen weakens relative to the us dollar on july 25 2012 we executed a series of separate currency exchange transactions pursuant to which we purchased call options to buy 10 billion new taiwan dollars with a weightedaverage strike price of 2921 new taiwan dollars per us dollars the net cost of these options which expire on april 2 2013 of 3 million is payable upon settlement these currency options mitigate the risk of a strengthening new taiwan dollar for our payments under the rexchip share purchase agreement these yen and new taiwan dollar option contracts were not designated for hedge accounting and are remeasured at fair value each period with gains and losses reflected in our results of operations therefore changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the yen and the new taiwan dollar could have a significant impact on our results of operations 

the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been legally challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda 

on january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimonda ag qimonda insolvency proceedings filed suit against us and micron semiconductor bv our netherlands subsidiary in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between us and qimonda signed in fall 2008 pursuant to which we purchased all of qimondas shares of inotera memories inc and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer the inotera shares purchased from qimonda to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent cross license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement a threejudge panel will render a decision after a series of hearings with pleadings arguments and witnesses a first hearing was held on september 25 2012 the next hearing is scheduled for february 5 2013 we are unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit and therefore cannot estimate the range of possible loss the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or equivalent monetary damages and the termination of the patent cross license which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition as of august 30 2012 the inotera shares purchased from qimonda had a net carrying value of 177 million 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies 

our key semiconductor memory technologies of dram nand flash and nor flash face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability to meet these requirements we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance andor cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies    there can be no assurance of the following 

 

if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities rd and product and process technology we estimate that capital spending for 2013 will be approximately 16 billion to 19 billion as of august 30 2012  we had cash and equivalents of 2459 million  and shortterm investments of  100 million  cash and investments included 157 million  held by imft which is generally not available to finance our other operations in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed    as a result of our current debt levels general economic conditions and adverse conditions in the credit markets   it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows access capital markets or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

debt obligations could adversely affect our financial condition 

we are engaged in a capital intensive business subject to significant changes in supply and demand and product pricing and recent periods of consolidation any of which could result in our incurrence or assumption of indebtedness in recent periods our debt levels have increased and are expected to continue to increase through 2013 as of august 30 2012  we had 33 billion  of debt including 949 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2014 in september and october 2012 we entered into financing arrangements that allow for borrowings up to 469 million in addition if we are able to complete the elpida acquisition we will fund 60 billion yen or approximately 750 million through a cash payment to elpida at the closing in exchange for 100 ownership of elpidas equity the remaining 140 billion yen or approximately 175 billion of payments will be made by the elpida companies in six annual installments payable at the end of each calendar year beginning in 2014 with payments of 20 billion yen or approximately 250 million in each of 2014 through 2017 and payments of 30 billion yen or approximately 375 million in each of 2018 and 2019 we may need to incur additional debt in the future 

our debt could adversely impact us for example it could 

 

our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future this to some extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that additional capital will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the convertible notes and our other debt and to fund other liquidity needs if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations we may need to refinance or restructure our debt including the convertible notes sell assets reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital if we were unable to implement one or more of these alternatives we may be unable to meet our payment obligations under the convertible notes and our other debt 

our joint ventures and strategic partnerships involve numerous risks 

we have entered into partnering arrangements to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these arrangements include our imft nand flash joint venture with intel our inotera dram joint venture with nanya our mp mask joint venture with photronics our transform joint venture with origin energy and our cmos image sensor wafer supply agreement with aptina    these joint ventures and strategic partnerships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the following 

 

if our joint ventures and strategic partnerships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected specifically as a result of a liquidation plan approved by the board of directors of transform in may 2012 we recognized a charge of 69 million  

an adverse outcome relating to allegations of anticompetitive conduct could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

on may 5 2004 rambus inc rambus filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county against us and other dram suppliers which alleged that the defendants harmed rambus by engaging in concerted and unlawful efforts affecting rambus dram by eliminating competition and stifling innovation in the market for computer memory technology and computer memory chips rambus complaint alleged various causes of action under california state law including among other things a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices a conspiracy to monopolize intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and unfair competition rambus sought a judgment for damages of approximately 39 billion joint and several liability trebling of damages awarded punitive damages a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint interest and attorneys fees and costs trial began on june 20 2011 and the case went to the jury on september 21 2011 on november 16 2011 the jury found for us on all claims on april 2 2012 rambus filed a notice of appeal to the california 1st district court of appeal 

we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter an adverse court determination of any lawsuit alleging violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

on january 13 2006 rambus filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california rambus alleges that certain of our ddr2 ddr3 rldram and rldram ii products infringe as many as fourteen rambus patents and seeks monetary damages treble damages and injunctive relief the accused products account for a significant portion of our net sales on june 2 2006 we filed an answer and counterclaim against rambus alleging among other things antitrust and fraud claims on january 9 2009 in another lawsuit involving us and rambus and involving allegations by rambus of patent infringement against us in the us district court for the district of delaware judge robinson entered an opinion in favor of us holding that rambus had engaged in spoliation and that the twelve rambus patents in the suit were unenforceable against us rambus subsequently appealed the delaware courts decision to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit on may 13 2011 the federal circuit affirmed judge robinsons finding of spoliation but vacated the dismissal sanction and remanded the case to the delaware district court for analysis of the remedy based on the federal circuits decision the northern district of california court stayed the trial of the patent phase of the northern district of california case upon appeal of the spoliation issue to the federal circuit in addition others have asserted and may assert in the future that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights see item 3 legal proceedings for additional details on these lawsuits 

we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

products that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one or more of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application if problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

 

new product development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop dram nand flash nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 

consolidation of industry participants and governmental assistance to some of our competitors may contribute to uncertainty in the semiconductor memory industry and negatively impact our ability to compete 

in recent years supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices of dram nand flash and nor flash products and substantial operating losses by us and our competitors the operating losses as well as limited access to sources of financing have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants some of our competitors may try to enhance their capacity and lower their cost structure through consolidation in addition some governments have provided and may be considering providing significant financial assistance to some of our competitors consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage 

we may incur additional material restructure charges in future periods 

in response to severe downturns in the semiconductor memory industry and global economic conditions we implemented restructure plans in prior periods and may need to implement restructure initiatives in future periods as a result we could incur restructure charges lose production output lose key personnel and experience disruptions in our operations and difficulties in the timely delivery of products 

the limited availability of raw materials supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier in recent periods we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the suppliers limited capacity our inability to timely obtain this equipment could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp if we are unable to timely obtain advanced semiconductor equipment our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate 

we have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations in addition our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations a natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations or the operations of our customers or suppliers may adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited 

we have a valuation allowance against substantially all us net deferred tax assets as of august 30 2012 our federal state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards were 35 billion  22 billion  and 737 million  respectively if not utilized substantially all of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2023 to 2032 and the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017 as of august 30 2012 our federal and state tax credit carryforwards were 208 million  and 203 million  respectively if not utilized substantially all of our federal and state tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2013 to 2032 as a consequence of prior business acquisitions utilization of the tax benefits for some of the tax carryforwards is subject to limitations imposed by section 382 of the internal revenue code and some portion or all of these carryforwards may not be available to offset any future taxable income the determination of these tax limitations is complex and requires a significant amount of judgment by us with respect to analysis of past transactions 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

across our multinational operations there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the singapore dollar euro shekel and yen we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 6 million for 2012 6 million for 2011 and 23 million for 2010 based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities offset by balance sheet hedges we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately us 8 million  as of august 30 2012 and us 9 million as of september 1 2011 in the event that the us dollar weakens significantly compared to the singapore dollar euro shekel or yen our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

in connection with the elpida sponsor agreement and rexchip share purchase agreement we entered into currency option transactions to mitigate the risk that increases in exchange rates have on our planned yen and new taiwan dollar payments we estimate that as of august 30 2012 a 10 decrease in exchange rates for the yen and new taiwan dollar compared with us dollar would result in losses of approximately us 108 million  for these currency options additionally we estimate that as of august 30 2012 a 10 decrease in exchange rates for the yen and new taiwan dollar compared with us dollar would result in a decrease of us 239 million of our planned payments under the elpida sponsor agreement and rexchip share purchase agreement 

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

sales to customers outside the united states approximated 85 of our consolidated net sales for 2012 in addition a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states in particular a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

these factors may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs additionally our control over operations at our imft inotera and mp mask joint ventures is limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment and equipment failures if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

breaches of our network security could expose us to losses 

we manage and store on our network systems various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations we also process store and transmit large amounts of data for our customers including sensitive personal information computer programmers and hackers may be able to gain unauthorized access to our network system and steal proprietary information compromise confidential information create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these parties may also be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that disrupt our operations and create security vulnerabilities attacks on our network systems could result in significant losses and damage our reputation with customers 

we are subject to counterparty default risks 

we have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that subject us to counterparty default risks including cash deposits investments foreign currency option and forward contracts and cappedcall contracts on our stock as a result we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default on its performance obligations a counterparty may default rapidly and without notice to us which could limit our ability to take action to mitigate our exposure additionally our ability to mitigate our exposures may be constrained by the terms of our contractual arrangements or because market conditions prevent us from taking effective action if one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy our ability to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterpartys default may be limited by the liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable laws governing the bankruptcy proceeding in the event of such default we could incur significant losses which could adversely impact our business results of operations or financial condition

elpida memory inc 

elpida sponsor agreement   

on july 2 2012 we entered into a sponsor agreement the sponsor agreement with the trustees of elpida memory inc “elpida” and elpidas whollyowned subsidiary akita elpida memory inc “akita” elpida and akita collectively the “elpida companies” the elpida companies filed petitions for corporate reorganization proceedings with the tokyo district court under the corporate reorganization act of japan on february 27 2012 

under the sponsor agreement we committed to support plans of reorganization for the elpida companies that would provide for payments to the secured and unsecured creditors of the elpida companies in an aggregate amount of 200 billion yen or approximately 25 billion less certain expenses of the reorganization proceedings and certain other items as a condition of the sponsor agreement we deposited 18 billion yen or approximately 23 million into an escrow account which will be applied to the share acquisition payments at closing of the aggregate amount we will fund 60 billion yen or approximately 750 million through a cash payment to elpida at the closing in exchange for 100 ownership of elpidas equity the remaining 140 billion yen or approximately 175 billion of payments will be made by the elpida companies using cash flows expected to be generated from our payment for foundry services provided by elpida as our subsidiary in six annual installments payable at the end of each calendar year beginning in 2014 with payments of 20 billion yen or approximately 250 million in each of 2014 through 2017 and payments of 30 billion yen or approximately 375 million in each of 2018 and 2019 

we have agreed to provide additional support to elpida which may include a payment guarantee under certain circumstances to facilitate its continued access to debtorinpossession financing of up to 16 billion yen or approximately 200 million from thirdparty finance sources through the closing of the elpida share purchase and to use reasonable efforts to assist elpida in obtaining up to 5 billion yen or approximately 63 million of continued debtorinpossession financing from third parties for up to two months following the closing in addition we have agreed to use reasonable efforts to assist the elpida companies in financing up to 64 billion yen or approximately 800 million of capital expenditures through june 30 2014 including up to 40 billion yen or approximately 500 million prior to june 30 2013 either by providing a payment guarantee under certain circumstances or by providing such financing directly 

under applicable japanese law following the closing of the transaction because a portion of the payments to creditors will be satisfied through the installment payments described above the operation of the businesses of the elpida companies will remain subject to the oversight of the court in charge of the reorganization proceedings and of the trustees including a trustee nominated by us upon the closing of the transaction 

the sponsor agreement contains certain termination rights including our right to terminate the sponsor agreement if a change taken together with all other changes occurs that is or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to i the business assets etc of elpida and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or to the business assets etc taken as a whole of rexchip electronics corporation rexchip a taiwanese corporation formed as a manufacturing joint venture by elpida and powerchip technology corporation powerchip a taiwanese corporation or ii our ability to operate elpidas business immediately following closing in substantially the same manner as conducted by elpida as of july 2 2012 elpida currently owns directly and indirectly through a subsidiary approximately 65  of rexchips outstanding common stock 

the trustees of the elpida companies submitted plans of reorganization to the court on august 21 2012 which plans are subject to court and creditor approval under applicable japanese law the sponsor agreement provides that the plans of reorganization submitted by the trustees are to contain terms consistent with the provisions of the sponsor agreement 

certain creditors of elpida are challenging the proposed plan of reorganization submitted by the trustees and have proposed an alternative plan of reorganization an examiner appointed by the court has reviewed both plans and is currently expected to make a recommendation to the court on or about october 29 2012 regarding whether to submit one or both plans of reorganization to creditors for approval

currency hedging 

elpida hedges   on july 2 2012 we executed a series of separate currency exchange transactions pursuant to which we purchased call options to buy 200 billion  yen with a weightedaverage strike price of 7915  yen per us dollar in addition to reduce the cost of these call options we sold put options to sell 100 billion  yen with a strike price of 8332  and we sold call options to buy 100 billion  yen with a strike price of 7557  the net cost of these call and put options which expire on april 3 2013 of 49 million  is payable upon settlement these currency options mitigate the risk of a strengthening yen for our yendenominated payments under the sponsor agreement while preserving some ability for us to benefit if the value of the yen weakens relative to the us dollar these option contracts were not designated for hedge accounting and are remeasured at fair value each period with gains and losses reflected in our results of operations 

rexchip hedges   on july 25 2012 we executed a series of separate currency exchange transactions pursuant to which we purchased call options to buy 10 billion  new taiwan dollars with a weightedaverage strike price of 2921  new taiwan dollar per us dollar the cost of these options which expire on april 2 2013 of 3 million  is payable upon settlement these currency options mitigate the risk of a strengthening new taiwan dollar for our payments under the rexchip share purchase agreement these option contracts were not designated for hedge accounting and are remeasured at fair value each period with gains and losses reflected in our results of operations 

results of operations 

consolidated results 



our net income loss attributable to micron shareholders for 2012 declined from 2011 primarily due to significant decreases in average selling prices for our principal products market selling prices for nand flash products declined for 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to large increases in supply from improvements in product and process technologies as well as expansions in production capacity which outpaced relatively healthy growth in demand market selling prices for dram products declined for 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to relatively low demand growth particularly for highvolume ddr3 dram as a result of weakness in the personal computer market our improvements in product and process technologies in 2012 enabled significant increases in sales volumes that mitigated reductions in net sales from price declines our improvements in product and process technologies and our cost structure in 2012 produced cost reductions for nand flash products sold to trade customers and for dram products partially offsetting the impact of the declines in average selling prices on our operating margins in 2011 we recognized gains of 275 million  from a 10year patent crosslicense agreement with samsung electronics co ltd samsung 

net sales 



total net sales decreased 6 for 2012 as compared to 2011 reflecting declines in average selling prices across all reportable segments partially offset by increases in sales volumes wsg sales decreased for 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to declines in average selling prices and in nor flash sales volumes as a result of weakness in market demand and our customer group in particular as well as a continued transition by customers from nor flash to nand flash dsg sales decreased primarily due to lower average selling prices partially offset by increases in sales volumes nsg and esg sales increased due to increases in sales volumes partially offset by declines in average selling prices 

total net sales for 2011 increased 4 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increases in wsg and esg sales as a result of the acquisition of numonyx in may 2010 dsg sales for 2011 decreased 31 as compared to 2010 primarily due to declines in average selling prices mitigated by increases in gigabit sales nsg sales for 2011 increased 4 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increases in gigabit sales partially offset by declines in average selling prices 

gross margin 

our overall gross margin percentage declined from 20 for 2011 to 12 for 2012 primarily due to decreases in the gross margin percentage for dsg and wsg as a result of significant declines in average selling prices cost reductions from improvements in product and process technologies in 2012 mitigated the effect of significant declines in average selling prices for all reportable operating segments costs of our underutilized capacity primarily associated with decreased production in our nor flash fabrication facilities and the ramp of our imfs nand flash fabrication facility were 141 million 133 million and 98 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

our overall gross margin percentage declined from 32 for 2010 to 20 for 2011 primarily due to a significant decline in the gross margin for dsg as a result of the dramatic decreases in average selling prices mitigated by a reduction in costs per gigabit declines in the gross margins of nsg wsg and esg primarily due to decreases in average selling prices also contributed to the overall decline in gross margin for 2011 as compared to 2010 the impact of declines in average selling prices for 2011 was partially offset by cost reductions 

operating results by business segments 

nand solutions group nsg 



nsg sales and operating results track closely with our average selling prices gigabit sales volumes and cost per gigabit for our consolidated sales of nand flash products see operating results by product – nand flash for further detail nsg sales for 2012 increased 30 from 2011 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices increases in gigabits sold for 2012 were primarily due to the continued ramp of our new wafer fabrication facility in singapore and from improvements in product and process technologies nsg sells a portion of its products to intel through im flash at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost all other nsg products are sold to oems resellers retailers and other customers including intel which we collectively refer to as trade customers 

nsg sales of nand flash products to trade customers increased 50 for 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to an increase in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices nsg operating income declined from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to decreases in average selling prices mitigated by cost reductions cost reductions resulted primarily from improvements in product and process technologies nsg operating income for 2011 benefited from a 57 million gain from an allocated portion of the samsung patent crosslicense agreement 

nsg sales of nand flash products to trade customers for 2011 decreased 2 from 2010 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by increases in gigabits sold nsg operating income for 2011 benefited from cost reductions and the 57 million gain from the license agreement with samsung which were partially offset by the declines in average selling prices 

the ramp of production at our new wafer fabrication facility in singapore significantly increased our nand flash production in 2012 and 2011 due to the completion of the first phase of the ramp we expect slower growth in our nand flash production for 2013 initially the new wafer fabrication facility in singapore was operated under our imfs joint venture with intel and our share of the operating costs and supply of nand flash from imfs was adjusted for changes in our ownership share in imfs our share of imfs output grew from 51 in the first quarter of 2011 to 78 in the second quarter of 2012 on april 6 2012  we acquired intels remaining ownership interest in imfs and the assets of imft located at our virginia fabrication facility and terminated the imfs supply agreement accordingly we now obtain all of the nand flash output from our singapore and virginia wafer fabrication facilities 

on april 6 2012 we also entered into a new supply agreement with intel under which intel purchases nand flash products from us on a costplus basis margins on products sold to intel on a costplus basis were not significantly different than margins on sales for other trade customers for 2012 aggregate nsg sales to intel including sales by imft at prices approximating cost and sales by us under the new costplus supply agreement were 986 million  for 2012 884 million for 2011 and 764 million for 2010 

dram solutions group dsg 



dsg sales and operating results track closely with our average selling prices gigabit sales volumes and cost per gigabit for our consolidated sales of dram products see operating results by product – dram for further detail dsg sales for 2012 decreased 16 as compared to 2011 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by increases in gigabits sold dsgs operating margin declined from 2011 to 2012 due to decreases in average selling prices mitigated by cost reductions as a result of improved product and process technologies dsg sales and operating margins for 2012 were adversely impacted by a 58 million charge for a settlement with a customer in addition dsg operating income for 2011 benefited from a 75 million gain from an allocated portion of the samsung patent crosslicense agreement 

the significant declines in dsg sales and margins for 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to a severe decrease in demand for pc dram particularly for ddr3 dram due to overall weakness in the pc market decreases in pc dram margins for 2011 were mitigated by the relatively higher margins in our server and other premium markets 

dsg operating income for 2011 benefited from the following items as compared to the corresponding periods of 2010 

 

wireless solutions group wsg 



in 2012 wsg sales were comprised of nor flash nand flash and dram in decreasing order of revenue the 40 decrease in wsg sales for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to declines in sales of wireless nor flash products as a result of weakness in market demand and our customer group in particular as well as a continued transition by customers to nand flash wsg sales in 2012 were also adversely impacted by lower sales of nand flash products sold in multichip packages the decline in wsg operating margin for 2012 was primarily due to the reductions in average selling prices and in nor flash sales volumes in addition wsg operating margin for 2011 benefited from a 95 million gain from an allocated portion of the samsung patent crosslicense agreement 

the 152 increase in wsg sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to the acquisition of numonyx in may 2010 wsg experienced pricing pressure in 2011 due to weakness in demand from certain customers during 2011 and 2010 a portion of the nand flash sold by wsg was obtained from hynix at market prices and by the end of 2011 substantially all of this supply was obtained from lowercost micron production the improvement in wsg operating margin for 2011 was primarily due to the 95 million gain from the license agreement with samsung 

embedded solutions group esg 



in 2012 esg sales were comprised of nor flash dram and nand flash in decreasing order of revenue the 5 increase in esg sales for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to increased sales volume of dram nand flash and nor flash products as esg continued to expand its customer base partially offset by declines in average selling prices esg operating income for 2012 declined as compared to 2011 due to decreases in average selling prices and higher costs associated with underutilized capacity in our nor flash facilities in addition esg operating margin for 2011 benefited from a 33 million gain from an allocated portion of the samsung patent crosslicense agreement 

the 92 increase in esg sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to the acquisition of numonyx in may 2010 absent impacts from the numonyx acquisition esgs performance in the automotive industrial and networking markets was relatively stable from 2010 to 2011 in addition during 2011 and 2010 a portion of the nand flash sold by esg was obtained from hynix at market prices and by the end of 2011 the majority of this supply was obtained from lowercost micron production the increase in esgs operating income for 2011 is primarily due to the acquisition of numonyx in addition esg operating income for 2011 benefited from the 33 million gain from the license agreement with samsung 

operating results by product 

net sales by product 



nand flash 

we sell a portion of our output of nand flash products to intel through im flash at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost see operating results by business segments – nand solutions group for further detail we sell the remainder of our nand flash products to trade customers 



increases in nand flash gigabits sold to trade customers for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to the ramp of the imfs fabrication facility and improved product and process technologies the new costplus supply agreement with intel also contributed to the increase in gigabits sold to trade customers for 2012 

the gross margin percentage on sales of nand flash products to trade customers declined slightly from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to decreases in average selling prices mitigated by cost reductions 

dram 



the increase in gigabit sales of dram products for 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to increased output obtained from our inotera joint venture the effects of a shift in mix to higherdensity products and improved product and process technologies the gross margin percentage on sales of dram products declined from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to the decreases in average selling prices mitigated by cost reductions dram sales and gross margins for 2012 were adversely impacted by the effects of the 58 million charge to revenue in 2012 for a settlement with a customer 

we have the right and obligation to purchase 50  of inoteras wafer production capacity under the inotera supply agreement as a result of our march 7 2012 equity contribution to inotera we expect to receive a higher share of inoteras 30nanometer output when it becomes available as a result of inotera capital investments enabled by this investment dram products acquired from inotera accounted for 46 of our dram gigabit production for 2012 as compared to 33 for 2011 and 23 for 2010 the higher level of production from inotera was achieved through inoteras continued transition to advanced product and process technologies we primarily obtained ddr3 dram products for the pc market from inotera in 2012 and 2011 our cost of wafers purchased under the inotera supply agreement is based on a marginsharing formula among nanya inotera and us under such formula all parties manufacturing costs related to wafers supplied by inotera as well as our and nanyas revenue for the resale of products from wafers supplied by inotera are considered in determining costs for wafers acquired from inotera our cost of products purchased under the inotera supply agreement in 2012 were lower than our cost of similar products manufactured in our whollyowned facilities 

due to significant market declines in the selling prices of dram inotera incurred net losses of 259 million  for its sixmonth period ended june 30 2012 and 737 million for its fiscal year ended december 31 2011 under generally accepted accounting principles in the republic of china inotera reported a loss for its quarter ended september 30 2012 of an additional new taiwan dollars 4390 million approximately 150 million us dollars in addition inoteras current liabilities exceeded its current assets by 185 billion  as of june 30 2012 which exposes inotera to liquidity risk as of june 30 2012 and december 31 2011 inotera was also not in compliance with certain loan covenants and had not been in compliance for the past several years which may result in its lenders requiring repayment of such loans during the next year inotera obtained a waiver from complying with its financial covenants through june 30 2012 and has requested an additional waiver from these requirements inoteras management has developed plans to improve its liquidity there can be no assurance that inotera will be successful in obtaining an additional waiver or improving its liquidity 

nor flash 

sales of nor flash products for 2012 declined from 2011 primarily due to decreases in sales of wireless nor flash 

products as a result of weakness in demand from certain customers and the continued transition of wireless applications to 

nand flash products that led to significant declines in average selling prices and sales volume our gross margin percentage on sales of nor flash products declined from 2011 to 2012 primarily due to decreases in average selling prices inventory writedowns and costs of underutilized capacity 

sales of nor flash products increased for 2011as compared to 2010 primarily due to our acquisition of numonyx in may 2010 as all of our sales of nor flash originated from this acquisition our gross margin percentage on sales of nor flash products for 2011 improved slightly as compared to 2010 primarily due to cost reductions 

operating expenses and other 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative sga expenses for 2012 increased 5 as compared to 2011 primarily due to a 13 million contribution to a university program and stockbased compensation and other amounts related to the death benefits of our former chief executive officer in 2012 

sga expenses for 2011 increased 12 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increased costs associated with numonyx operations and higher payroll costs partially offset by a reduction in legal costs the reduction in legal costs from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to 64 million of costs in 2010 for settlements of an indirect purchasers antitrust case and other matters we expect that sga expenses will approximate 135 million to 145 million for the first quarter of 2013 

research and development 

rd expenses for 2012 increased 16 from 2011 primarily due to a higher volume of development wafers processed higher personnel costs associated with increased salary and wage rates and additional headcount for our expanded rd operations and higher software and materials costs 

rd expenses for 2011 increased 27 from 2010 primarily due to increased costs associated with rd activities for acquired numonyx operations higher payroll costs and a higher volume of prequalification wafers processed 

as a result of amounts reimbursable from nanya under a dram rd costsharing arrangement rd expenses were reduced by 138 million  141 million  and 51 million  for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the april 6 2012  agreements with intel expanded our nand flash rd costsharing agreement to include certain emerging memory technologies but did not change the costsharing percentage as a result of amounts reimbursable from intel rd expenses were reduced by 87 million  95 million  and 104 million  for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively we expect that rd expenses net of amounts reimbursable from our rd partners will be approximately 220 million to 230 million for the first quarter of 2013 

our process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts include our high density ddr3 and ddr4 dram and mobile low power ddr dram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including multilevel and triplelevel cell technologies nor flash memory specialty memory phasechange memory solidstate drives and other memory technologies and systems 

interest income expense 

interest expense for 2012  2011  and 2010 included aggregate amounts of noncash amortization of debt discount and other costs of 83 million 60 million and 76 million respectively interest expense for 2012 also included 9 million  of makewhole premium paid to holders of our 2013 notes see item 8 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – debt note 

other 

further discussion of other operating and nonoperating income and expenses can be found in the following notes contained in item 8 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

liquidity and capital resources 



cash and equivalents in the table above included 157 million  held by imft as of august 30 2012 and 327 million  held by both imft and imfs as of september 1 2011 our ability to access funds held by imft to finance our other operations is subject to agreement by the other member and contractual limitations amounts held by imft are not anticipated to be available to finance our other operations 

to mitigate credit risk we invest through highcreditquality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor as of august 30 2012 the effect of repatriating cash held by foreign subsidiaries where undistributed earnings have been indefinitely reinvested would not be significant 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity our liquidity is highly dependent on selling prices for our products and the timing and level of our capital expenditures both of which can vary significantly from period to period depending on conditions in the semiconductor memory market our cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash and investments may not be adequate to meet our needs for capital expenditures and operations in 2012 we obtained 1065 million  of proceeds from issuance of debt and 609 million  of proceeds from equipment saleleaseback financing in the first quarter of 2013 we entered into additional financing arrangements as detailed under financing activities below and we expect to pursue additional financing in the future as cost effective and strategic opportunities arise we expect our cash and investments cash flows from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet our requirements at least through 2013 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 2114 million  for 2012 which reflected approximately 1572 million generated from the production and sales of our products and a net 542 million effect from changes in the amount invested in net working capital for 2012 inventories decreased by 258 million due to our efforts to manage our business at a lower level of inventories and negotiated changes in the im flash wafer supply agreement with intel 

investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities was 2312 million  for 2012 which consisted primarily of cash expenditures of 1699 million  for property plant and equipment and 412 million for the acquisition of availableforsale securities net of proceeds from sales and maturities of 152 million we believe that to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and capital equipment and rd we estimate that capital spending for 2013 will be approximately 16 billion to 19 billion the actual amounts for 2013 will vary depending on market conditions as of august 30 2012 we had commitments of approximately 550 million for the acquisition of property plant and equipment substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year 

in the second quarter of 2012 we loaned 133 million to inotera under a 90day note with a stated annual interest rate of 2 to facilitate the purchase of capital equipment necessary to implement new process technology the loan was repaid to us with accrued interest in march 2012 also in march 2012 we contributed 170 million to inotera which increased our ownership percentage from 297 to 397 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities was 497 million  for 2012 which included 1065 million  of proceeds from issuance of debt 609 million  of proceeds from equipment saleleaseback financing transactions partially offset by 194 million  of net distributions to noncontrolling interests 203 million  for repayments of debt and 172 million  of payments on equipment purchase contracts 

on april 18 2012 we issued 550 million of 2375 convertible senior notes due may 2032 the 2032c notes and 450 million of 3125 convertible senior notes due may 2032 the 2032d notes and together with the 2032c notes the 2032 notes at face value issuance costs for the 2032 notes totaled 21 million and we paid 103 million  to purchase capped calls to partially offset the potential dilutive effect if the 2032 notes are converted into shares resulting in net proceeds of 876 million from issuance of the 2032 notes 

on april 6 2012  we entered into a series of agreements with intel relating to our imfs and imft joint ventures in connection therewith we acquired intels 18  interest in imfs for 466 million in addition we acquired the assets of imft located at our virginia wafer fabrication facility for which intel received a distribution from imft of 139 million additionally intel deposited  300 million  with us which will be applied to intels future purchases of nand flash under a supply agreement or under certain circumstances refunded as of august 30 2012 45 million  of the deposit had been applied we also entered into a senior unsecured promissory note with intel in april 2012 under the terms of the note we borrowed 65 million payable with interest in eight approximately equal quarterly installments 

in 2012 im flash distributed 391 million  to intel and intel made contributions to im flash of 177 million  

on september 5 2012 we entered into a threeyear revolving credit facility under this credit facility we can draw up to the lesser of 255 million or 80 of the net outstanding balance of a pool of certain accounts receivable we granted a security interest in such receivables to collateralize the facility the availability of the facility is subject to certain customary conditions including the absence of any event or circumstance that has a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition interest is payable monthly on any outstanding principal balance at a variable rate equal to the 30day singapore interbank offering rate sibor plus 28 per annum 

on october 2 2012 we entered into a facility agreement to obtain financing collateralized by semiconductor production equipment subject to customary conditions we can draw up to 214 million under the facility agreement prior to april 4 2013 amounts drawn are payable in 10 equal semiannual installments beginning six months after the draw date on october 18 2012 we drew 173 million with interest at 238 per annum additional amounts drawn will bear interest at our option at either i a fixed rate negotiated at the time of the draw request or ii a floating rate equal to the sixmonth libor rate plus 16 per annum the facility agreement contains customary covenants

on july 2 2012 we entered into the sponsor agreement and the rexchip share purchase agreement that require aggregate payments by us of approximately 60 billion yen and 10 billion new taiwan dollars approximately 11 billion at the closing of the transactions which we expect to occur in the first half of calendar 2013 plus additional installment payments by the elpida companies of 140 billion yen or approximately 175 billion in the aggregate from 2014 through 2019 in addition capital expenditures will be required in furtherance of the planned technology road maps for the elpida and rexchip operations we are obligated to provided financial support subject to certain conditions which may include guarantees of elpidas financing for up to 200 million of working capital and up to 800 million for capital expenditures we may be required to provide these obligations even if the transactions do not close see overview – elpida memory inc” 

contractual obligations 



the obligations disclosed above do not include contractual obligations recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities except for the current portion of longterm debt the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services market prices changes to agreedupon amounts or timing of certain events for some obligations 

purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria 1 they are noncancellable 2 we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled or 3 we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services takeor pay if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancellable the entire value of the contract was included in the above table if the obligation is cancellable but we would incur a penalty if canceled the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation contracted minimum amounts specified in takeorpay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment 

pursuant to the inotera supply agreement we have an obligation to purchase 50 of inotera’s semiconductor memory capacity subject to specific terms and conditions as purchase quantities are based on qualified production output the inotera supply agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity and therefore we did not include our obligations under the inotera supply agreement in the contractual obligations table above our obligation under the inotera supply agreement also fluctuates due to pricing which is based on manufacturing costs and revenues associated with the resale of dram products we purchased 646 million  of dram products from inotera in 2012 under the inotera supply agreement 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

concurrent with the offering of the 2032c and 2032d notes in april 2012 we entered into capped call transactions that have an initial strike price of approximately 980 and 1016 per share respectively subject to certain adjustments which was set to be slightly higher than the initial conversion prices of approximately 963 for the 2032c notes and 998 for the 2032d notes and cap prices that range from 1426 per share to 1604 per share the 2012 capped calls the 2012 capped calls cover subject to antidilution adjustments similar to those contained in the 2032 notes an approximate combined total of 1006 million shares of common stock the 2012 capped calls expire on various dates between may 2016 and may 2018 the 2012 capped calls are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the 2032c and 2032d notes

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

business acquisitions  accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values 

consolidations  we have interests in joint venture entities that are variable interest entities vies determining whether to consolidate a vie may require judgment in assessing 1 whether an entity is a vie and 2 if we are the entitys primary beneficiary to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we evaluate whether we have a the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and b the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding and financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies requires significant assumptions and judgment 

contingencies  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 

income taxes  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value cost includes labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analyses of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated market values below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated market value of our memory inventory by approximately 129 million as of august 30 2012 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories our inventories have been generally categorized as memory primarily dram nand flash and nor flash and imaging products the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 

property plant and equipment  we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us including but not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

research and development  costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as rd as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are valued in inventory 

stockbased compensation    stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fairvalue of the award and is recognized as expense using the straightline amortization method over the requisite service period for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgment 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new accounting standard on the presentation of comprehensive income the new standard requires the presentation of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements we adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2012 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued a new accounting standard on fair value measurements that clarifies the application of existing guidance and disclosure requirements changes certain fair value measurement principles and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements we adopted this standard in the third quarter of 2012 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

as of august 30 2012   3087 million  of our  3262 million  of debt was at fixed interest rates as a result the fair value of the debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates the estimated fair value of our debt was  3622 million  as of august 30 2012  and  2281 million  as of september 1 2011  we estimate that as of august 30 2012  a 1 decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our fixedrate debt instruments by approximately  88 million  as of august 30 2012   175 million  of the debt had variable interest rates the increase in interest expense caused by a 1 increase in the rates would be approximately 2 million  

as of august 30 2012  we held shortterm debt investments of 100 million  and longterm debt investments of 364 million  that were subject to interest rate risk we estimate that as of august 30 2012  a 05 increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair value of our shortterm and longterm debt instruments by approximately 3 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in item 1a risk factors changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the functional currency for all of our operations is the us dollar as a result of our foreign operations we incur costs and carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies the substantial majority of our revenues are transacted in the us dollar however significant amounts of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro the shekel the yen and the yuan we have established currency risk management programs for our operating expenditures and capital purchases to hedge against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates we utilize currency forward and option contracts in these hedging programs our hedging programs reduce but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

to hedge our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates from our monetary assets and liabilities we utilize a rolling hedge strategy with currency forward contracts that generally mature within 35 days based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities offset by balance sheet hedges we estimate that a 10 adverse change in exchange rates versus the us dollar would result in losses of approximately us 8 million  as of august 30 2012 and us 9 million as of september 1 2011 to hedge the exposure of changes in cash flows from changes in currency exchange rates for certain capital expenditures and forecasted operating cash flows we utilize currency forward contracts that generally mature within 12 months and currency options that generally mature from 12 to 18 months 

in connection with the elpida sponsor agreement and rexchip share purchase agreement we may be required to make aggregate payments of 200 billion  yen and approximately 10 billion  new taiwan dollars of the aggregate amount 60 billion  yen and approximately 10 billion  new taiwan dollars will be due at the closing of the transactions and the remaining 140 billion yen amounts will be made by the elpida companies in annual installments from 2014 through 2019 see item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – elpida memory inc” these payments are contingent upon the closing of the transaction and are therefore not recorded on our balance sheet as of august 30 2012 changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the yen and the new taiwan dollar could have a significant impact on our financial statements if the transactions are consummated 

to mitigate the risk that increases in exchange rates have on our planned yen and new taiwan dollar payments we entered into currency option transactions these currency options did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and are markedtomarket at the end of each reporting period and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in other operating income loss see item 8 – financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – derivative financial instruments” we estimate that as of august 30 2012 a 10 decrease in exchange rates for the yen and new taiwan dollar compared with us dollar would result in losses of approximately us 108 million  for these currency options additionally we estimate that as of august 30 2012 a 10 decrease in exchange rates for the yen and new taiwan dollar compared with us dollar would result in a decrease of us 239 million of our planned payments under the elpida sponsor agreement and rexchip share purchase agreement

manufacturing 

our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china israel italy malaysia puerto rico and singapore our inotera joint venture also has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan in 2011 we sold our wafer fabrication facility in japan to tower semiconductor ltd tower and entered into a supply agreement for tower to manufacture products for us in the facility through approximately may 2014 our manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment a significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment dram nand and nor share common manufacturing processes enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines 

our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment we continuously enhance our production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in 2011 we transitioned the majority of our dram production to 42nm linewidth process technology and began transitioning to 30nm linewidth process technology in 2011 most of our nand flash memory products were manufactured on our 25nm linewidth process technology and we expect to continue transitioning to 20nm linewidth process technology in 2012 in 2011 we manufactured all of our nand flash and our highvolume dram products on 300mm wafers we manufactured nor flash some specialty dram and cmos image sensor products on 200mm wafers in 2011 the majority of our nor flash memory products were manufactured on our 65nm linewidth process technology and we expect to continue transitioning to 45nm linewidth technology in 2012 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

after fabrication most silicon wafers are separated into individual die we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie bare die forms for packaged products functional die are sorted connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages we assemble products in a variety of packages including tsop thin small outline package tqfp thin quad flat package and fbga fine pitch ball grid array bare die products address customer requirements for smaller form factors and higher memory densities and provide superior flexibility for use in packaging technologies such as systemsinapackage sips and multichip packages mcps which reduce the board area required 

we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process perform high temperature burnin on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition we use our proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of dram die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

we assemble a significant portion of our memory products into memory modules memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards pcbs that insert directly into computer systems or other electronic devices we also contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture lexarbrand flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices 

we utilize subcontractors to perform a significant portion of our assembly and module assembly services outsourcing these services enables us to reduce costs and minimize our capital investment 

in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing process although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 

nand flash joint ventures with intel corporation 

our im flash joint ventures with intel manufacture nand flash memory products for the exclusive benefit of the partners we share the output of im flash with intel generally in proportion to our and intels investment in im flash in 2011 im flash began ramping production at a new singapore wafer fabrication facility and we expect that output from this facility will significantly increase our overall nand flash production in 2012 

inotera 

under a supply agreement with inotera we have the right and obligation to obtain 50 of inoteras total capacity of approximately 130000 300mm dram wafer starts per month as of september 1 2011 inotera accounted for 33 of our dram gigabit production in 2011 

mp mask 

we produce photomasks for leadingedge and advanced next generation semiconductors through mp mask we and photronics also have supply arrangements wherein we have agreed to purchase a substantial majority of the reticles produced by mp mask 

aptina supply agreement 

we manufacture cmos image sensor products for aptina under a wafer supply agreement 

see partnering arrangements 

availability of raw materials 

our production processes require raw materials that meet exacting standards including several that are customized for or are unique to us we generally have multiple sources and sufficient availability of supply however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames molding compound and other materials shortages may occur from time to time in the future in addition transportation problems could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is interrupted or our lead times extended our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

marketing and customers 

our products are sold into computing consumer networking telecommunications automotive industrial and imaging markets market concentrations from 2011 net sales were approximately as follows computing including desktop pcs servers notebooks and workstations 30  mobile 25  consumer electronics 15  and networking and storage 15  sales to intel primarily of nand flash from our im flash joint ventures were 10 of our net sales in 2011 9 of our net sales in 2010 and 20 of our net sales in 2009 sales to hewlettpackard company primarily of dram were 9 of our net sales in 2011 and 13 of our net sales in 2010 

our semiconductor memory products are offered under the micron lexar® crucial™ spectek® and numonyx® brand names and private labels we market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales offices in our primary markets around the world we sell lexarbranded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucial™branded products through a webbased customer direct sales channel as well as channel and distribution partners our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products 

we offer products designed to meet the diverse needs of computing server automotive networking commercialindustrial consumer electronics mobile embedded security and medical applications many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several months 

backlog 

because of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

product warranty 

because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery under our general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions 

competition 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory markets from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation spansion inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices many of our highvolume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to our competitors for these highvolume memory products the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed power consumption reliability compatibility size and form factors for our other memory products the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedent to pricing 

research and development 

our process technology research and development rd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rd efforts focus on advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts are concentrated on our high density ddr3 dram and lpddr2 mobile lpdram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including multilevel cell technology nor flash memory specialty memory pcm and other nextgeneration memories and memory systems 

our rd expenses were 791 million 624 million and 647 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we generally share rd process and design costs for nand flash equally with intel and for dram equally with nanya as a result of reimbursements under our nand flash and dram cost sharing arrangements with our joint venture partners our overall rd expenses were reduced by 236 million 155 million and 107 million in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

to compete in the semiconductor memory industry we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions our process development center and largest design center are located at our corporate headquarters in boise idaho in 2011 we began construction of a new 450mmwafer capable rd facility in boise which we expect will be ready for tool installations in the beginning of calendar year 2012 we have several additional product design centers in other strategic locations around the world in addition we develop leading edge photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boise 

rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of us 

we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business 

if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected we have experienced significant decreases in our average selling prices in recent years as noted in the table below in some prior periods average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs 



we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at the rate average selling prices decline 

our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes including reducing the die size of our existing products in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to improve or maintain gross margins factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes technological barriers and changes in process technologies or products that may require relatively larger die sizes per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products 

an adverse outcome relating to allegations of anticompetitive conduct could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

on may 5 2004 rambus inc rambus filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county against us and other dram suppliers alleging that the defendants harmed rambus by engaging in concerted and unlawful efforts affecting rambus dram rdram by eliminating competition and stifling innovation in the market for computer memory technology and computer memory chips rambus complaint alleges various causes of action under california state law including among other things a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices a conspiracy to monopolize intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and unfair competition rambus is seeking a judgment for damages of approximately 39 billion joint and several liability trebling of damages awarded punitive damages a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint interest and attorneys fees and costs trial began on june 20 2011 and the case went to the jury on september 21 2011 at the time of this filing a jury verdict is pending we cannot predict when a verdict will be reached or when a formal judgment would be entered by the court subsequent to a verdict in the event of an adverse judgment we would anticipate filing appropriate postjudgment motions and appeals we may be required to post a bond or other security to stay enforcement of an adverse judgment pending appeal depending on the amount required we cannot assure you we would be able to obtain sufficient security to pursue an appeal we are unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss nor estimate a range of possible loss accordingly we have not provided an accrual for an adverse judgment in the september 1 2011 financial statements however we have accrued a liability and charged operations for estimated costs to successfully defend the matter an adverse judgment may have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition including liquidity 

on september 24 2010 oracle america inc oracle successor to sun microsystems a dram purchaser that optedout of a direct purchaser class action suit that was settled filed suit against us in us district court for the northern district of california the complaint alleges dram pricefixing and other violations of federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws based on purported conduct for the period from august 1 1998 through at least june 15 2002 oracle is seeking joint and several damages trebled as well as restitution disgorgement attorneys fees costs and injunctive relief 

we are unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits an adverse court determination in any of these lawsuits alleging violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation spansion inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs the transitions to smaller linewidth process technologies and 300mm wafers in the industry have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business 

the downturn in the worldwide economy had an adverse effect on our business a continuation or further deterioration of depressed economic conditions could have an even greater adverse effect on our business adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers and other computing and networking products mobile devices flash memory cards and usb devices reduced demand for our products could result in continued market oversupply and significant decreases in our average selling prices a continuation of current negative conditions in worldwide credit markets would limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

inoteras liquidity risk may adversely impact our ownership interest and supply agreement 

because of significant market declines in the selling price of dram inotera incurred net losses of 278 million for the sixmonth period ended june 30 2011 also inoteras current liabilities exceeded its current assets by 23 billion as of june 30 2011 which exposes inotera to liquidity risk further under generally accepted accounting principles in the republic of china inotera reported a loss for its quarter ended september 30 2011 of an additional new taiwan dollars 7022 million approximately 241 million us dollars inoteras management has developed plans to improve its liquidity if inotera is unable to adequately improve its liquidity we may have to impair our 323 million investment in inotera in connection with our ownership equity interest in inotera we have rights and obligations to purchase 50 of the wafer production capacity of inotera in 2011 we purchased  641 million of dram products from inotera and our supply from inotera accounted for 37 or our dram gigabit production in the fourth quarter of 2011 as a result if our supply of dram from inotera is impacted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our supply agreement with inotera involves numerous risks 

our supply agreement with inotera involves numerous risks including the following 

 15 

 

the acquisition of our ownership interest in inotera from qimonda has been legally challenged by the administrator of the insolvency proceedings for qimonda 

on january 20 2011 dr michael jaffé administrator for qimonda ag qimonda insolvency proceedings filed suit against us and micron semiconductor bv our netherlands subsidiary in the district court of munich civil chamber the complaint seeks to void under section 133 of the german insolvency act a share purchase agreement between us and qimonda in fall 2008 pursuant to which we purchased all of qimondas shares of inotera memories inc and seeks an order requiring us to retransfer the inotera shares to the qimonda estate the complaint also seeks to terminate under sections 103 or 133 of the german insolvency code a patent cross license between us and qimonda entered into at the same time as the share purchase agreement a hearing is scheduled to begin on november 9 2011 we are unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit the final resolution of this lawsuit could result in the loss of the inotera shares or equivalent monetary damages and the termination of the patent cross license which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operation or financial condition 

our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce competitive new memory technologies 

our key semiconductor memory technologies of dram nand flash and nor flash face technological barriers to continue to meet longterm customer needs these barriers include potential limitations on the ability to shrink products in order to reduce costs meet higher density requirements and improve power consumption and reliability to meet these requirements we expect that new memory technologies will be developed by the semiconductor memory industry our competitors are working to develop new memory technologies that may offer performance andor cost advantages to our existing memory technologies and render existing technologies obsolete accordingly our future success may depend on our ability to develop and produce viable and competitive new memory technologies  there can be no assurance of the following 

 

if our efforts to develop new semiconductor memory technologies are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology capital equipment facilities research and development and product and process technology we estimate that capital spending for 2012 will be approximately 2 billion the actual amounts for 2012 will vary depending on funding participation by joint venture partners and market conditions as of september 1 2011  we had cash and equivalents of 2160 million  of which  327 million consisted of cash and investments of im flash that is generally not available to finance our other operations in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed  as a result of the downturn in general economic conditions and the adverse conditions in the credit markets  it may be difficult for us to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency or access capital markets our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our joint ventures and strategic partnerships involve numerous risks 

we have entered into partnering arrangements to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these arrangements include our im flash nand flash joint ventures with intel our inotera dram joint venture with nanya our mp mask joint venture with photronics our transform joint venture with origin energy and our cmos image sensor wafer supply agreement with aptina  these joint ventures and strategic partnerships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the following 

 

if our joint ventures and strategic partnerships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

on january 13 2006 rambus filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california rambus alleges that certain of our ddr2 ddr3 rldram and rldram ii products infringe as many as fourteen rambus patents and seeks monetary damages treble damages and injunctive relief the accused products account for a significant portion of our net sales on june 2 2006 we filed an answer and counterclaim against rambus alleging among other things antitrust and fraud claims on january 9 2009 in another lawsuit involving us and rambus and involving allegations by rambus of patent infringement against us in the us district court for the district of delaware judge robinson entered an opinion in favor of us holding that rambus had engaged in spoliation and that the twelve rambus patents in the suit were unenforceable against us rambus subsequently appealed the delaware courts decision to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit on may 13 2011 the federal circuit affirmed judge robinsons finding of spoliation but vacated the dismissal sanction and remanded the case to the delaware district court for analysis of the remedy based on the federal circuits decision the northern district of california court stayed a trial of the patent phase of the northern district of california case upon appeal of the spoliation issue to the federal circuit see item 1 legal proceedings for additional details on this lawsuit and other rambus matters pending in the us and europe 

we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

products that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition in recent periods we have further diversified and expanded our product offerings which could potentially increase the chance that one of our products could fail to meet specifications in a particular application if problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

 

we may make future acquisitions and alliances which involve numerous risks 

acquisitions and the formation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 

 

acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and future transactions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the limited availability of raw materials supplies or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases photoresist lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including photolithography tools we are sometimes dependent on a single supplier in recent periods we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the suppliers limited capacity our inability to obtain this equipment timely could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp if we are unable to obtain advanced semiconductor equipment timely our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

new product development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop dram nand flash nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers we cannot assure you that our product development efforts will be successful that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 

our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited 

we have a valuation allowance against substantially all us net deferred tax assets as of september 1 2011 our federal state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards were 29 billion 20 billion and 529 million respectively if not utilized substantially all of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2022 to 2031 and the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2015 as of september 1 2011 our federal and state tax credit carryforwards were 206 million and 215 million respectively if not utilized substantially all of our federal and state tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2013 to 2031 as a consequence of prior business acquisitions utilization of the tax benefits for some of the tax carryforwards is subject to limitations imposed by section 382 of the internal revenue code and some portion or all of these carryforwards may not be available to offset any future taxable income the determination of these tax limitations is complex and requires a significant amount of judgment by us with respect to analysis of past transactions 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

across our multinational operations there are transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency primarily the singapore dollar euro and yen we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of  6 million for 2011 and 23 million for 2010 to the extent our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as of september 1 2011 are not hedged we estimate that a 1 change in the exchange rate versus the us dollar would expose us to foreign currency gains or losses of approximately us  2 million for the euro and us  1 million for the yen and singapore dollar in the event that the us dollar weakens significantly compared to the singapore dollar euro or yen our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

sales to customers outside the united states approximated 84 of our consolidated net sales for 2011 in addition a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states in particular a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

these factors may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs additionally our control over operations at our im flash inotera mp mask and transform joint ventures is limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment and equipment failures if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may incur additional material restructure charges in future periods 

in response to a severe downturn in the semiconductor memory industry and global economic conditions we implemented restructure initiatives that resulted in net charges of 70 million in 2009 and 33 million in 2008 we may need to implement further restructure initiatives in future periods as a result of these initiatives we could incur restructure charges lose production output lose key personnel and experience disruptions in our operations and difficulties in delivering products timely 

consolidation of industry participants and governmental assistance to some of our competitors may contribute to uncertainty in the semiconductor memory industry and negatively impact our ability to compete 

in recent years supply of memory products has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices of dram nand flash and nor flash products and substantial operating losses by us and our competitors the operating losses as well as limited access to sources of financing have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants some of our competitors may try to enhance their capacity and lower their cost structure through consolidation in addition some governments have provided or are considering providing significant financial assistance to some of our competitors consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage

overview 

our results of operations for 2011 were impacted by the following key transactions and events 

rambus antitrust litigation 

on may 5 2004 rambus inc rambus filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county against us and other dram suppliers alleging that the defendants harmed rambus by engaging in concerted and unlawful efforts affecting rambus dram rdram by eliminating competition and stifling innovation in the market for computer memory technology and computer memory chips rambus complaint alleges various causes of action under california state law including among other things a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices a conspiracy to monopolize intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and unfair competition rambus is seeking a judgment for damages of approximately 39 billion joint and several liability trebling of damages awarded punitive damages a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint interest and attorneys fees and costs trial began on june 20 2011 and the case went to the jury on september 21 2011 at the time of this filing a jury verdict is pending we cannot predict when a verdict will be reached or when a formal judgment would be entered by the court subsequent to a verdict on september 29 2011 we entered into a judgment sharing agreement with hynix semiconductor inc a codefendant in the case pursuant to which each party agreed if found liable to share equally any joint and several 

damages in the event of an adverse judgment we would anticipate filing appropriate postjudgment motions and appeals we may be required to post a bond or other security to stay enforcement of an adverse judgment pending appeal depending on the amount required there can be no assurance we would be able to obtain sufficient security to pursue an appeal we are unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss nor estimate a range of possible loss accordingly we have not provided an accrual for an adverse judgment in the september 1 2011 financial statements however we have accrued a liability and charged operations for estimated costs to successfully defend the matter an adverse judgment may have a material impact on our business results of operations and financial condition including liquidity 

numonyx holdings bv numonyx 

on may 7 2010 we acquired numonyx which manufactured and sold primarily nor flash and nand flash memory products the total fair value of the consideration paid for numonyx was 1112 million and consisted of 1377 million shares of our common stock issued to the numonyx shareholders and 48 million restricted stock units issued to employees of numonyx in connection with the acquisition we recorded net assets of 1549 million because the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price we recognized a gain on the acquisition of 437 million in the third quarter of 2010 in addition we recognized a 51 million income tax benefit in connection with the acquisition see item 8 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – numonyx note 

japan fabrication facility 

on june 2 2011 we sold our wafer fabrication facility in japan the japan fab to tower semiconductor ltd tower under the arrangement tower paid  40 million in cash and approximately 20 million of tower ordinary shares in addition we will receive an aggregate amount of  20 million in twelve equal monthly installments beginning in the second quarter of 2012 we recorded a gain of  54 million net of transaction costs of  3 million  in connection with the sale of the japan fab we also recorded a tax provision of  74 million related to the gain on the sale and to write down certain deferred tax assets associated with the japan fab in connection with the sale of the japan fab we entered into a supply agreement for tower to manufacture products for us in the facility through approximately may 2014 

business segments 

in the second quarter of 2011 we reorganized our business to better align with the markets we serve all prior period amounts have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect this reorganization after the reorganization we have the following four reportable segments 

dram solutions group dsg includes dram products sold to the pc consumer electronics networking and server markets 

nand solutions group nsg includes highvolume nand flash products sold into data storage personal music players and the highdensity computing markets as well as nand flash products sold to intel through our consolidated im flash joint ventures 

wireless solutions group wsg     includes dram nand flash and nor flash products including multichip packages sold to the mobile device market 

embedded solutions group esg includes dram nand flash and nor flash products sold into automotive and industrial applications as well as nor and nand flash sold to consumer electronics networking pc and server markets 

our other operations do not meet the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment and are reported under all other all other includes our cmos image sensor led microdisplay and solar operations 

results of operations 

consolidated results 



net sales 



total net sales for 2011 increased 4 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increases in wsg and esg sales as a result of the acquisition of numonyx in may 2010 dsg sales for 2011 decreased 31 as compared to 2010 primarily due to declines in average selling prices mitigated by increases in gigabit sales nsg sales for 2011 increased 4 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increases in gigabit sales partially offset by declines in average selling prices 

total net sales for 2010 increased 77 as compared to 2009 as a result of improved sales across all reportable segments increases in dsg and nsg sales for 2010 primarily reflect significant increases in gigabits sold for both segments and improved average selling prices for dsg products increases in esg and wsg sales for 2010 were primarily the result of the acquisition of numonyx 

gross margin 

our overall gross margin percentage declined from 32 for 2010 to 20 for 2011 primarily due to a significant decline in the gross margin for dsg as a result of the dramatic decreases in average selling prices mitigated by a reduction in costs per gigabit declines in the gross margins of nsg wsg and esg primarily due to declines in average selling prices also contributed to the overall decrease in gross margin for 2011 as compared to 2010 the impact of declines in average selling prices for 2011 was partially offset by cost reductions 

our overall gross margin percentage improved to 32 for 2010 from negative 9 for 2009 primarily due to improvements in the gross margin for all reportable segments as a result of cost reductions and improved dram pricing our gross margin percentage was also impacted by our acquisition of numonyx in may of 2010 as gross margins for numonyx activities were 19 for the 2010 period after the acquisition 

our gross margins in prior years were impacted by charges to write down inventories to their estimated market values as a result of the significant decreases in average selling prices for both dram and nand flash products as charges to write down inventories are recorded in advance of when inventories are sold gross margins in subsequent reporting periods are higher than they otherwise would be our gross margins for 2010 and 2009 were 40 million and 164 million higher as a result of the net impact of sales of products that had been written down to their estimated marked values in prior periods in future periods we will be required to record additional inventory writedowns if estimated average selling prices of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarterend date are below the manufacturing cost of those products 

operating results by business segments 

dram solutions group dsg 



dsg sales and operating results track closely with our average selling prices gigabit sales volumes and cost per gigabit for our consolidated sales of dram products see operating results by product groups  dram for further detail dsg sales for 2011 decreased 31 from 2010 primarily due to significant declines in average selling prices partially offset by an increase in sales volume dsg operating income decreased from 2010 to 2011 primarily as a result of the significant declines in average selling prices mitigated by reductions in manufacturing costs per gigabit as a result of improved production efficiencies 

the significant declines in dsg sales and margins for 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to a severe decrease in demand for pc dram particularly for ddr3 dram due to overall weakness in the pc market decreases in pc dram margins for 2011 were mitigated by the relatively higher margins in our server and other premium markets 

dsg operating income for 2011 benefited from the following items as compared to the corresponding periods of 2010 

 

we have formed partnering arrangements and have sold or licensed technology to other parties dsg recognized royalty and license revenue of 25 million in 2011 83 million in 2010 and 120 million in 2009 we have a partnering arrangement with nanya pursuant to which we and nanya jointly develop process technology and designs to manufacture stack dram products in addition we have deployed and licensed certain intellectual property related to the manufacture of stack dram products to nanya and licensed certain intellectual property from nanya we recognized 65 million and 105 million of license revenue in net sales from this arrangement during 2010 and 2009 respectively in april 2010 the license agreement was completed and we began to share dram development costs with nanya on an approximately equal basis this costsharing arrangement reduced our overall research and development costs by 141 million and 51 million for 2011 and 2010 respectively of which 109 million and 51 million was attributed to dsg dsg received royalties of 25 million and 6 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively from nanya for sales of stack dram products manufactured by or for nanya on process nodes of 50nm or larger and we expect to continue to receive royalties from nanya associated with technology developed prior to the costsharing arrangement 

dsg sales for 2010 increased 121 from 2009 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold and average selling prices per gigabit the increase in gigabits sold for 2010 was largely due to additional supply obtained from inotera which accounted for 23 of our dram gigabit production in 2010 as compared to 4 for 2009 the increase in average selling prices in 2010 for dsg products from improved market conditions was partially offset by a shift in product mix resulting from increases in sales of inotera trench dram products that had significantly lower average selling prices per gigabit than our other dsg products 

nand solutions group nsg 



nsg sales and operating results track closely with our average selling prices gigabit sales volumes and cost per gigabit for our consolidated sales of nand flash products nsg sales for 2011 increased 4 from 2010 primarily due to increases in gigabits sold partially offset by declines in average selling prices we sell nsg products in three principal channels 1 to intel corporation intel through our im flash consolidated joint ventures at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost 2 to original equipment manufacturers oems and other resellers and 3 to retailers 

nsg sales through im flash to intel were 884 million for 2011 764 million for 2010 and 886 million for 2009 the ramp of production at im flashs new wafer fabrication facility in singapore began to increase our nand flash production in the second half of 2011 and we expect that it will significantly increase our nand flash production in 2012 our share of the operating costs and supply of nand flash from imfs adjusts in proportion to changes in our ownership share either 12 months or 8 months depending on the status of imfs production ramp from the date of the applicable ownership change accordingly we anticipate that our share of imfs costs and supply will increase from 57 as of september 1 2011 to our current ownership interest in imfs during the course of 2012 in september 2011 subsequent to the end of our 2011 we contributed 103 million and intel contributed 131 million to imfs decreasing our ownership interest in imfs to 82 the following table presents the contributions and ownership percentages of imfs 



nsg sales of nand flash products to our oem reseller and retail customers decreased 2 for 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to declines in average selling prices partially offset by an an increase in gigabits sold nsg operating income increased for 2011 as compared to 2010 despite declines in average selling prices due to 1 reductions in manufacturing costs per gigabit as a result of improved production efficiencies and higher nand flash production and 2 other operating gains including a 57 million gain from the samsung license arrangement nsgs costs of goods sold for 2011 2010 and 2009 included 81 million 60 million and 60 million respectively of underutilized capacity costs from the imfss wafer fabrication facility in singapore we expect that the underutilized capacity costs will decrease significantly in 2012 due to the qualification of imfs products for sale in the third quarter of 2011 

nsg sales for 2010 increased 21 from 2009 primarily due to an increase in gigabits produced partially offset by a decline in average selling prices per gigabit the decline in average selling prices was primarily due to declines in prices on sales of nand flash to intel as a result of cost reductions and were partially offset by increases in average selling prices to trade customers nsgs operating income improved for 2010 from 2009 primarily due to reductions in costs per gigabit the reductions in manufacturing costs per gigabit for 2010 were partially offset by the declines in overall average selling prices per gigabit nsgs operating income for 2009 included a 144 million gain from termination of a supply agreement with intel 

wireless solutions group wsg 



in 2011 wsg sales were composed of nor flash nand flash and dram in decreasing order of revenue the 152 increase in wsg sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to the acquisition of numonyx in may of 2010 wsg experienced pricing pressure in 2011 due to weakness in demand from certain customers in addition during 2011 and 2010 a portion of the nand flash sold by wsg was obtained from hynix at market prices and by the end of 2011 substantially all of this supply was obtained from lowercost micron production the improvement in wsgs operating income for 2011 is primarily due to a 95 million gain from the samsung license arrangement recognized by wsg in 2011 

the significant increase in wsg sales for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to the acquisition of numonyx operating loss for wsg improved for 2010 from 2009 primarily due to cost reductions and improvements in average selling prices partially offset by higher rd expenses 

embedded solutions group esg 



in 2011 esg sales were composed of nor flash dram and nand flash in decreasing order of revenue the 92 increase in esg sales for 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to the acquisition of numonyx in may of 2010 absent impacts from the numonyx acquisition esgs performance in the automotive industrial and networking markets was relatively stable from 2010 to 2011 in addition during 2011 and 2010 a portion of the nand flash sold by esg was obtained from hynix at market prices and by the end of 2011 the majority of this supply was obtained from lowercost micron production the improvement in esgs operating income for 2011 is primarily due to the acquisition of numonyx in addition esg recognized a 33 million gain from the samsung license arrangement in 2011 

the significant increase in esg sales for 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to the acquisition of numonyx operating income for esg improved for 2010 from 2009 primarily due to cost reductions and improvements in average selling prices partially offset by higher rd expenses 

operating results by product 

net sales by product 



partially as a result of a decrease in dram product sales in 2011 and an increase in nand flash product sales during the same period in the fourth quarter of 2011 sales of nand flash products were higher than sales of dram products this marks the first time in our history that the primary product by revenue was not dram 

dram 



the increase in gigabit sales of dram products for 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to increased output obtained from our inotera joint venture and improved production efficiencies sales of ddr3 and ddr2 dram were 51 and 25 respectively of total dram sales for 2011 and 37 and 40 respectively of total dram sales for 2010 

the gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2011 declined significantly as compared to 2010 primarily due to the declines in average selling prices particularly for ddr3 dram sold into the pc market partially offset by cost reductions resulting from improvements in manufacturing efficiencies the gross margin percentage for 2011 was also adversely affected by an increasing percentage of products obtained from inotera the gross margin percentage on sales of dram products for 2010 improved significantly as compared to 2009 primarily due to cost reductions and increases in average selling prices 

we have rights and obligations to purchase 50 of inoteras wafer production capacity under a supply agreement with inotera the inotera supply agreement dram products acquired from inotera accounted for 33 of our dram gigabit production in 2011 as compared to 23 for 2010 and 4 for 2009 products obtained from inotera in 2011 were primarily ddr3 for the pc market our cost of wafers purchased under the inotera supply agreement is based on a marginsharing formula among nanya inotera and ourselves under such formula all parties manufacturing costs related to wafers supplied by inotera as well as our and nanyas revenue for the resale of products from wafers supplied by inotera are considered in determining costs for wafers acquired from inotera in 2011 the cost of wafers purchased from inotera was significantly higher than our cost of wafers manufactured in our facilities because of significant market declines in the selling price of dram inotera incurred net losses of 278 million for the sixmonth period ended june 30 2011 also inoteras current liabilities exceeded its current assets by 23 billion as of june 30 2011 which exposes inotera to liquidity risk further under generally accepted accounting principles in the republic of china inotera reported a loss for its quarter ended september 30 2011 of an additional new taiwan dollars 7022 million approximately 241 million us dollars inoteras management has developed plans to improve its liquidity we cannot assure you that inoteras plan to improve its liquidity will be successful 

nand flash 



approximately half of our output of nand flash products has been sold to intel through our im flash consolidated joint ventures at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost sales of nand flash products to intel were 884 million for 2011 764 million for 2010 and 886 million for 2009 see segment operating results  nand solutions group for further detail the remainder of our sales of nand flash products is to trade customers ie customers other than intel 

we sell nand flash products in various forms including discrete standalone devices as well as in multichip packages mcps and other nand flash systems solution products mcps and system solutions products which combine nand flash devices with a controller andor other semiconductor devices generally have significantly higher average selling prices and costs per gigabit than discrete nand flash devices our sales of mcps and other system solution nand flash products increased in 2011 from 2010 due primarily to our acquisition of numonyx and to targeted efforts at increasing sales of these products our mix of singlelevel cell slc and multilevel cell mlc nand flash products also impacted our average selling prices and sales volumes slc products have fewer bits per wafer but higher average selling prices per gigabit as compared to mlc products these shifts in the mix of our products increased our average selling prices and cost per gigabit in 2011 as compared to 2010 

increases in gigabits sold for both 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to increased production efficiencies the ramp of the imfs wafer fabrication facility in singapore also contributed to the increase in production for 2011 our acquisition of numonyx in may 2010 also contributed to increases in sales volumes to trade customers in 2011 and 2010 

the gross margin percentage on sales of nand flash products to trade customers for 2011 declined as compared to 2010 primarily due to the declines in average selling prices the gross margin percentage on sales of nand flash products to trade customers for 2010 improved as compared to 2009 primarily due to cost reductions and by the increases in average selling prices 

nor flash 

the increases in our sales of nor flash products for 2011 and 2010 were primarily due to our acquisition of numonyx in may 2010 as all of our sales of nor flash originated from this acquisition our gross margin percentage on sales of nor products for 2011 improved slightly as compared to 2010 primarily due to cost reductions 

operating expenses and other 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative sga expenses for 2011 increased 12 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increased costs associated with numonyx operations and higher payroll costs partially offset by a reduction in legal costs the reduction in legal costs from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to 64 million of costs in 2010 for estimated settlements in an indirect purchasers antitrust case and other matters 

sga expenses for 2010 increased 49 from 2009 primarily due to the costs associated with the indirect purchasers settlements increased costs associated with numonyx operations higher payroll costs and numonyx acquisition costs the increase in sga expenses for 2010 was partially offset by a reduction in expenses for imaging operations as a result of the sale of a 65 interest in aptina imaging corporation aptina in the fourth quarter of 2009 we expect that sga expenses will approximate 155 million to 165 million for the first quarter of 2012 

research and development 

rd expenses for 2011 increased 27 from 2010 primarily due to the following 

• increased costs associated with rd activities for acquired numonyx operations 

• higher payroll costs and 

• a higher volume of prequalification wafers processed 

increases in rd costs for 2011 from the above factors was partially offset by amounts received under a dram costsharing arrangement with nanya that commenced in the third quarter of 2010 as a result of amounts reimbursable from nanya under the dram rd costsharing arrangement rd expenses were reduced by 141 million for 2011 and 51 million for 2010 

rd expenses for 2010 decreased 4 from 2009 primarily due to the following 

 

decreases in rd costs for 2010 from the above factors was partially offset by higher payroll expenses resulting from the accrual of incentivebased compensation costs and additional 79 million of rd expenses in connection with the may 7 2010 acquisition of numonyx 

as a result of amounts reimbursable from intel under a nand flash rd costsharing arrangement rd expenses were reduced by 95 million 104 million and 107 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively we expect that rd expenses net of amounts reimbursable from our rd partners will be approximately 200 million to 230 million for the first quarter of 2012 

our process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts are concentrated on our high density ddr3 dram and lpddr2 mobile low power dram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including multilevel cell technology nor flash memory specialty memory phase change and memory systems 

interest income expense 

interest expense for 2011 2010 and 2009 included aggregate amounts of noncash amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of 60 million 76 million and 71 million respectively net proceeds received at inception from some of our convertible notes were allocated between a liability component issued at a discount and an equity component the debt discount is being amortized from issuance through the expected maturity dates of such convertible notes with the amortization recorded as additional noncash interest expense included in the aggregate noncash interest expense is amortization on the convertible notes of 54 million for 2011 56 million for 2010 and 52 million for 2009 see item 1 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – debt note 

other nonoperating income expense net 

other nonoperating expense for 2011 included a 111 million loss recognized in the first quarter of 2011 in connection with a series of debt restructure transactions with certain holders of our convertible notes see item 1 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – debt note 

other nonoperating income for 2011 also included 15 million in connection with the release of our guarantee of debt in a joint venture in which we previously participated see item 1 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – debt note 

other nonoperating income for 2010 included a gain of 56 million recognized in the first quarter of 2010 in connection with an issuance of common shares in a public offering by inotera memories inc inotera as a result of the issuance our interest in inotera decreased from 355 to 298 see item 1 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – equity method investments – inotera and meiya dram joint ventures with nanya note

liquidity and capital resources 

as of september 1 2011 and september 2 2010 we had the following cash and equivalents 



to mitigate credit risk we invest through highcreditquality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor our ability to access funds held by im flash to finance our other operations is subject to agreement by the joint venture partners and contractual limitations amounts held by im flash are not anticipated to be available to finance our other operations 

cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity our liquidity is highly dependent on average selling prices for our products and the timing and level of our capital expenditures both of which can vary significantly from period to period depending on conditions in the semiconductor memory market our cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash and investments may not be adequate to meet our needs for capital expenditures and operations we may pursue additional financing alternatives in the future as cost effective and strategic opportunities arise 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 2484 million for 2011 which reflected approximately 2423 million generated from the production and sales of our products 230 million net of tax from a patent crosslicense agreement with samsung offset by a net 169 million effect from an increase in the amount invested in working capital primarily due to a 357 million increase in inventories 

investing activities 

net cash used for investing activities was 2201 million for 2011 which consisted primarily of cash expenditures of 2550 million for property plant and equipment and 159 million for the acquisition of noncontrolling interests in tech partially offset by 330 million released from restricted cash we believe that to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and capital equipment and research and development we estimate that capital spending for 2012 will be approximately 2 billion the majority of which is expected to be incurred in the first half of 2012 the actual amounts for 2012 will vary depending on market conditions as of september 1 2011 we had commitments of approximately 600 million for the acquisition of property plant and equipment substantially all of which is expected to be paid within one year 

amounts released to us from restricted cash in 2011 included the following 

 

financing activities 

net cash used for financing activities was 1036 million for 2011 which included 1215 million of payments on debt 322 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts 225 million of distributions to joint venture partners partially offset by 690 million of proceeds from convertible debt offerings and 268 million of proceeds from equipment saleleaseback financing transactions 

on july 26 2011  we issued  345 million of 15 convertible senior notes due august 1 2031 the 2031a notes and  345 million of 1875 convertible senior notes due august 1 2031 the 2031b notes and together with the 2031a notes the 2031 notes at face value issuance costs for the 2031 notes totaled 18 million 

on july 26 2011 concurrent with the offering of the 2031 notes we entered into capped call transactions the 2011 capped calls that have an initial strike price of approximately 950 per share subject to certain adjustments which was set to equal initial conversion price of the 2031 notes 

on july 26 2011 we paid 150 million to repurchase 197 million shares of common stock at 760 per share 

in the third quarter of 2011 we prepaid the remaining 250 million outstanding under our tech subsidiarys credit facility 

on november 3 2010 we completed the following series of debt restructure transactions in connection with separate privately negotiated agreements entered into on october 28 2010 with certain holders of our convertible notes 

 

see item 1 financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements  debt and item 1 financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements  shareholders equity notes 

joint ventures 

in 2011 im flash distributed 225 million to intel timing of future distributions to intel is subject to market conditions and availability of cash in 2011 im flash began installing tools at its new 300mm wafer fabrication facility in singapore we made contributions to im flash of 1580 million in 2011 and 103 million in september 2011 subsequent to 2011 intel did not make any contributions to im flash in 2011 but contributed 131 million in september 2011 we expect to make additional significant contributions to im flash in future periods in connection with tool installations and the further ramp of production at the singapore facility the level of our future capital contributions to im flash will depend on market conditions and the extent to which intel participates with us in future im flash capital calls 

in the second quarter of 2011 we acquired hps and canons interests in our tech subsidiary for an aggregate of 159 million and we became a 100 owner of tech as a result of these transactions 

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of september 1 2011 



the obligations disclosed above do not include contractual obligations recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities except for the current portion of longterm debt the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services market prices changes to agreedupon amounts or timing of certain events for some obligations 

purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria 1 they are noncancellable 2 we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled or 3 we must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take delivery of the contracted products or services takeorpay if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancellable the entire value of the contract was included in the above table if the obligation is cancellable but we would incur a penalty if canceled the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation contracted minimum amounts specified in takeorpay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment 

pursuant to the inotera supply agreement we have an obligation to purchase 50 of inotera’s semiconductor memory capacity subject to specific terms and conditions as purchase quantities are based on qualified production output the inotera supply agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity and therefore we did not include our obligations under the inotera supply agreement in the contractual obligations table above our obligation under the inotera supply agreement also fluctuates due to pricing which is based on manufacturing costs and revenues associated with the resale of dram products we purchased 641 million of dram products from inotera in 2011 under the inotera supply agreement 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

concurrent with the offering of the 2031 notes on july 26 2011 we entered into capped call transactions the 2011 capped calls that have an initial strike price of approximately 950 per share subject to certain adjustments which was set to the initial conversion price of the 2031 notes the 2011 capped calls are in four equal tranches have cap prices of 1140 1216 1267 and 1317 per share and cover subject to antidilution adjustments similar to those contained in the 2031 notes an approximate combined total of 726 million shares of common stock the 2011 capped calls expire on various dates between july 2014 and february 2016 the 2011 capped calls are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the 2031 notes 

concurrent with the offering of the 425 convertible senior notes due 2013 the 2013 notes in april 2009 we paid approximately 25 million for three capped call instruments that have an initial strike price of approximately 508 per share the 2009 capped calls the 2009 capped calls have a cap price of 664 per share and cover an aggregate of approximately 452 million shares of common stock the 2009 capped calls expire in october and november of 2012 the 2009 capped calls are intended to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of the 2013 notes 

concurrent with the offering of the 2014 notes in may 2007 we paid approximately 151 million for three capped call transactions the 2007 capped calls the 2007 capped calls cover an aggregate of approximately 913 million shares of common stock the 2007 capped calls are in three equal tranches with cap prices of 1725 2013 and 2300 per share respectively each with an initial strike price of approximately 1423 per share subject to certain adjustments the 2007 capped calls expire on various dates between november 2011 and december 2012 the 2007 capped calls are intended to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of the 2014 notes

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

business acquisitions  accounting for acquisitions requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values 

consolidations  we have interests in joint venture entities that are variable interest entities vies determining whether to consolidate a vie may require judgment in assessing 1 whether an entity is a vie and 2 if we are the entitys primary beneficiary to determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie we evaluate whether we have 1 the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie our evaluation includes identification of significant activities and an assessment of our ability to direct those activities based on governance provisions and arrangements to provide or receive product and process technology product supply operations services equity funding and financing and other applicable agreements and circumstances our assessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of our vies requires significant assumptions and judgment 

contingencies  we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 

income taxes  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world these estimates involve judgment and interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 

inventories  inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value and we recorded charges of 603 million in aggregate for 2009 and 282 million in aggregate for 2008 to write down the carrying value of inventories of memory products to their estimated market values cost includes labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analysis of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated market values below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated market value of our memory inventory by approximately 143 million at september 1 2011 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories our inventories have been categorized as memory imaging and microdisplay products the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 

property plant and equipment  we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us include but are not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required by us in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

research and development  costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are valued in inventory 

stockbased compensation  compensation cost for stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fairvalue of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award for stockbased compensation awards with graded vesting that were granted after 2005 we recognize compensation expense using the straightline amortization method for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgment 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates we develop these estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new accounting standard on variable interest entities vies which 1 replaces the quantitativebased risks and rewards calculation for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a vie with an approach that is primarily qualitative 2 requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie and 3 requires additional disclosures about an enterprises involvement in vie we adopted this standard as of the beginning of 2011 the initial adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our financial statements as of the adoption date the impact on future periods will depend on changes in the nature and composition of our vies 

recently issued accounting standards 

in may 2011 the fasb issued a new accounting standard on fair value measurements that clarifies the application of existing guidance and disclosure requirements changes certain fair value measurement principles and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements we are required to adopt this standard in the third quarter of 2012 we do not expect this adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued a new accounting standard on the presentation of comprehensive income the new standard requires the presentation of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the new standard also requires presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented we are required to adopt this standard as of the beginning of 2013 the adoption of this standard will only impact the presentation of our financial statements

as of september 1 2011   1950 million of our  2001 million of debt was at fixed interest rates as a result the fair value fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates the estimated fair value of our debt was  2281 million as of september 1 2011 and  2565 million as of september 2 2010  we estimate that as of september 1 2011  a 1 decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our fixedrate debt instruments by approximately  59 million  as of september 1 2011   51 million of the debt had variable interest rates and a 1 increase in the rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately  1 million  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in item 1a risk factors changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

the functional currency for substantially all of our operations is the us dollar we held cash and other assets in foreign currencies valued at an aggregate of us  512 million as of september 1 2011 and us  504 million as of september 2 2010  we also had foreign currency liabilities valued at an aggregate of us  944 million as of september 1 2011  and us  901 million as of september 2 2010  because the substantial majority of our sales are denominated in us dollar we do not have significant natural hedges to offset our expenditures denominated in other currencies significant components of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar our reporting currency were as follows in us dollar equivalents 



we estimate that based on the assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as of september 1 2011  a 1 change in the exchange rate versus the us dollar resulting in currency gains or losses of approximately us  2 million for the euro and  1 million for the yen and singapore dollar  during 2010 we began using derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk see item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – derivative financial instruments note

partnering arrangements 

the following is a summary of our partnering arrangements as of september 2 2010 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

manufacturing 

our manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china israel italy japan malaysia the philippines puerto rico and singapore our inotera joint venture also has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan our manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment most semiconductor equipment must be replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment 

our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment we continuously enhance our production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in the second half of 2010 most of our dram products were manufactured using our 50nm linewidth process technology and we expect to transition our dram production to 42nm linewidth process technology in 2011 in 2010 we began transitioning production of our nand flash memory products to our 25nm linewidth process technology and expect that most of our nand flash products will be manufactured with this process technology in 2011 in 2010 we manufactured substantially all of our highvolume dram and nand flash products on 300mm wafers we manufactured nor flash some specialty dram and cmos image sensor products on 200mm wafers 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks circuit design marginalities or defects and dust particles can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes we are able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

after fabrication most silicon wafers are separated into individual die we sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie “bare die” forms for packaged products functional die are sorted connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages we assemble products in a variety of packages including tsop thin small outline package tqfp thin quad flat package and fbga fine pitch ball grid array bare die products address customer requirements for smaller form factors and higher memory densities and provide superior flexibility for use in packaging technologies such as systemsinapackage sips and multichip packages mcps which reduce the board area required 

we test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process perform high temperature burnin on finished products and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition we use our proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of dram die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

we assemble a significant portion of our memory products into memory modules memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards “pcbs” that insert directly into computer systems or other electronic devices we also contract with independent foundries and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture lexar flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices 

we utilize subcontractors to perform a significant portion of our assembly test and module assembly services outsourcing these services enables us to reduce costs and minimize our capital investment 

in recent years we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing process although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 

  

  

 

nand flash joint ventures with intel corporation our im flash joint ventures with intel manufacture nand flash memory products for the exclusive benefit of the partners we share the output of im flash with intel generally in proportion to their investment in im flash in the second quarter of 2010 im flash began moving forward with startup activities in a new singapore wafer fabrication facility including placing purchase orders and tool installations that commenced in the first quarter of 2011 

inotera     under a supply agreement with inotera we have the right and obligation to obtain 50 of inotera’s output estimated to be approximately 65000 300mm dram wafer starts per month by the end of calendar 2010 in 2010 inotera substantially completed a transition of its manufacturing from trench dram process technology to our stack dram process technology 

tech our tech joint venture in singapore manufactures dram products using our product and process technology subject to specific terms and conditions we have agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by tech in 2010 tech accounted for approximately 24 of our total wafer production and 45 of our total dram production 

mp mask we produce photomasks for leadingedge and advanced next generation semiconductors through mp mask we and photronics also have supply arrangements wherein we purchase a substantial majority of the reticles produced by mp mask 

aptina supply agreement     we manufacture cmos image sensor products for aptina under a wafer supply agreement 

  

see “partnering arrangements” 

availability of raw materials 

our production processes require raw materials that meet exacting standards including several that are customized for or are unique to us we generally have multiple sources and sufficient availability of supply however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases lead frames molding compound and other materials in addition transportation problems could delay our receipt of raw materials although raw materials shortages or transportation problems have not significantly interrupted our operations in the past shortages may occur from time to time in the future also lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is interrupted or lead times are extended our results of operations could be adversely affected 

marketing and customers 

our products are sold into computing consumer networking telecommunications and imaging markets approximately 45 of our net sales for 2010 were to the computing market which includes desktop pcs servers notebooks and workstations sales to hewlettpackard company primarily of dram were 13 of our net sales in 2010 sales to intel primarily of nand flash from our im flash joint ventures were 9 of our net sales in 2010 20 of our net sales in 2009 and 19 of our net sales in 2008 

our memory products are offered under the micron lexar® crucial™ and spectek® brand names and private labels our numonyx products are offered under the numonyx® brand name we market our memory and numonyx semiconductor products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales offices in our primary markets around the world we sell lexarbranded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our crucial™branded products primarily through a webbased customer direct sales channel our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis we make shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors’ products we maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products 

we offer products designed to meet the diverse needs of computing server automotive networking commercialindustrial consumer electronics mobile embedded security and medical applications many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several months 

  

  

 

backlog 

because of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly we typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment for these reasons we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

product warranty 

because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery under our general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our general terms and conditions 

competition 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory markets from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation spansion inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices 

research and development 

our process technology research and development “rd” efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rd efforts focus on advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts are concentrated on our high density ddr3dram and lpddr2 mobile lpdram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including multilevel cell technology nor flash memory specialty memory pcm and memory systems 

our rd expenses were 624 million 647 million and 680 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively we generally share rd process and design costs for nand flash equally with intel and for dram equally with nanya as a result of reimbursements under our nand flash and dram cost sharing arrangements with our joint venture partners our overall rd expenses were reduced by 155 million 107 million and 148 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

to compete in the semiconductor memory industry we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes we believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions our process development center and largest design center are located at our corporate headquarters in boise idaho we have several additional product design centers in other strategic locations around the world in addition we develop leading edge photolithography mask technology at our mp mask joint venture facility in boise 

rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of us 

we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business 

for 2010 average selling prices of nand products decreased 18 and average selling prices of dram products increased 28 the increase in average selling prices for dram products is the first increase since 2004 for 2009 average selling prices of dram and nand flash products decreased 52 and 56 respectively as compared to 2008 for 2008 average selling prices of dram and nand flash products decreased 51 and 67 respectively as compared to 2007 for 2007 average selling prices of dram and nand flash products decreased 23 and 56 respectively as compared to 2006 in some prior periods average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at the rate average selling prices decline 

our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes including reducing the die size of our existing products in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to improve or maintain gross margins factors that may limit our ability to reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes and changes in process technologies or products that inherently may require relatively larger die sizes per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products 

the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation spansion inc and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs the transitions to smaller linewidth process technologies and 300mm wafers in the industry have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production as a result of improving conditions in the semiconductor memory market in recent periods our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

  

 

the inability to reach an acceptable agreement with our tech joint venture partners regarding the future of tech after its shareholders’ agreement expires in april 2011 could have a significant adverse effect on our dram production and results of operation 

since 1998 we have participated in tech a semiconductor memory manufacturing joint venture in singapore among us canon inc “canon” and hewlettpackard company “hp” as of september 2 2010 the ownership of tech was held approximately 87 by us approximately 10 by canon and approximately 3 by hp the financial results of tech are included in our consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2010 tech accounted for 48 of our total dram wafer production the shareholders’ agreement for tech expires in april 2011 in the first quarter of 2010 tech received a notice from hp that it does not intend to extend the tech joint venture beyond april 2011 we have been in discussions with hp and canon to reach a resolution of the matter however there remain wide gaps between our position and those of hp and canon the parties’ inability to reach a resolution of this matter prior to april 2011 would per the terms of the shareholders’ agreement result in the sale of tech’s assets as of september 2 2010 the carrying value of tech’s net assets was 11 billion and in the event of dissolution our loss could be a significant portion of this amount in addition the parties’ inability to reach a resolution prior to april 2011 could result in the sale of tech’s assets and could require repayment of tech’s credit facility 348 million outstanding as of september 2 2010 the sale of tech’s assets per the terms of the shareholders’ agreement may have a significant adverse impact on our dram production and results of operation 

 

integration of our acquired numonyx business may disrupt operations and result in significant costs 

the integration of our acquired numonyx business is a complex timeconsuming and expensive process that even with proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt the business of numonyx and our other operations realizing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will depend in part on the timely integration of technology operations and personnel if we are unable to successfully integrate numonyx with our operations in a timely manner our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected the challenges involved in this integration include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

the downturn in the worldwide economy may harm our business 

the downturn in the worldwide economy had an adverse effect on our business a continuation or deterioration of depressed economic conditions could have an even greater adverse effect on our business adverse economic conditions affect demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers and other computing and networking products mobile devices flash memory cards and usb devices reduced demand for our products could result in continued market oversupply and significant decreases in our average selling prices a continuation of current negative conditions in worldwide credit markets would limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology facilities and capital equipment research and development and product and process technology we expect that capital spending will be approximately 24 billion to 29 billion for 2011 the actual amount in 2011 will vary depending on funding participation by joint venture partners and market conditions as of september 2 2010 we had cash and equivalents of 2913 million of which 601 million consisted of cash and investments of im flash and tech that would generally not be available to finance our other operations in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed as a result of the downturn in general economic conditions and the adverse conditions in the credit markets it may be difficult to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency or access capital markets our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our joint ventures and strategic partnerships involve numerous risks 

we have entered into partnering arrangements to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these arrangements include our im flash nand flash joint ventures with intel our inotera dram joint venture with nanya our tech dram joint venture our mp mask joint venture with photronics our transform joint venture with origin energy and our cmos image sensor wafer supply agreement with aptina  these joint ventures and strategic partnerships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

if our joint ventures and strategic partnerships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

our ownership interest in inotera involves numerous risks 

our 299 ownership interest in inotera involves numerous risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in connection with our ownership equity interest in inotera we have rights and obligations to purchase 50 of the wafer production of inotera in 2010 we purchased 693 million of dram products from inotera 

an adverse outcome relating to allegations of anticompetitive conduct could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

on may 5 2004 rambus inc “rambus” filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county against us and other dram suppliers alleging that the defendants harmed rambus by engaging in concerted and unlawful efforts affecting rambus dram “rdram” by eliminating competition and stifling innovation in the market for computer memory technology and computer memory chips rambus’ complaint alleges various causes of action under california state law including among other things a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices a conspiracy to monopolize intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and unfair competition rambus alleges that it is entitled to actual damages of more than a billion dollars and seeks joint and several liability treble damages punitive damages a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint interest and attorneys’ fees and costs a trial date has not been scheduled see “item 1 legal proceedings” for additional details on this case and other rambus matters pending in the us and europe 

on september 24 2010 oracle america inc “oracle” successor to sun microsystems a dram purchaser that optedout of a direct purchaser class action suit that was settled filed suit against us in us district court for the northern district of california the complaint alleges dram pricefixing and other violations of federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws based on purported conduct for the period from august 1 1998 through at least june 15 2002 oracle is seeking joint and several damages trebled as well as restitution disgorgement attorneys’ fees costs and injunctive relief 

  

  

 

we are unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits an adverse court determination in any of these lawsuits alleging violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

on january 13 2006 rambus filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california rambus alleges that certain of our ddr2 ddr3 rldram and rldram ii products infringe as many as fourteen rambus patents and seeks monetary damages treble damages and injunctive relief the accused products account for a significant portion of our net sales on june 2 2006 we filed an answer and counterclaim against rambus alleging among other things antitrust and fraud claims on january 9 2009 in another lawsuit involving us and rambus and involving allegations by rambus of patent infringement against us in the us district court for the district of delaware judge robinson entered an opinion in favor of us holding that rambus had engaged in spoliation and that the twelve rambus patents in the suit were unenforceable against us rambus subsequently appealed the delaware court’s decision to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit that appeal is pending subsequently the northern district of california court stayed a trial of the patent phase of the northern district of california case pending the outcome of the appeal of the delaware court’s spoliation decision or further order of the california court see “item 1 legal proceedings” for additional details on this lawsuit and other rambus matters pending in the us and europe 

on march 6 2009 panavision imaging llc filed suit against us and aptina imaging corporation then a whollyowned subsidiary of ours in the us district court for the central district of california the complaint alleges that certain of our and aptina’s image sensor products infringe four panavision imaging us patents and seeks injunctive relief damages attorneys’ fees and costs 

 

we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

products that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses if despite design review quality control and product qualification procedures problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

 

 

 

  

  

 

there are a number of risks and uncertainties related to numonyx’s former joint venture with hynix 

in connection with our purchase of numonyx on may 7 2010 we acquired a 207 noncontrolling equity interest in hynixnumonyx semiconductor ltd the “hynix jv” a joint venture with hynix semiconductor inc “hynix” and hynix semiconductor wuxi limited the change in control of numonyx gave hynix the right to purchase all of our equity interests in the hynix jv hynix exercised its right to purchase our interest in the hynix jv and consummated the equity transfer on august 31 2010 for 423 million 

a significant portion of numonyxs sales are dependent upon sales of products supplied to us by the hynix jv pursuant to a supply agreement on july 29 2010 we entered into a new supply agreement with hynix which provides for the continued supply of products through september 30 2011 at market rates pricing under the new agreement is not anticipated to be as favorable as pricing under the jv supply agreement that existed prior to the sale of our ownership interest in the hynix jv 

concurrent with the numonyx acquisition we entered into agreements with stmicroelectronics nv and dbs bank ltd “dbs”   that require us to guarantee an outstanding 250 million loan due in periodic installments from 2014 through 2016 made by dbs to the hynix jv under the agreements on august 31 2010 we deposited 250 million of proceeds from the sale of our interest in the hynix jv into a pledged account at dbs to collateralize our obligations under the guarantee of the loan the amount on deposit in the dbs account is accounted for as restricted cash on our balance sheet the amount on deposit and our guarantee decrease as payments are made by the hynix jv against the loan there can be no assurance that the hynix jv will not default under such loan 

we may make future acquisitions and alliances which involve numerous risks 

acquisitions and the formation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and future transactions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

new product development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop dram nand flash nor flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will allow us to recover costs of development efforts 

our debt level is higher than compared to historical periods 

we currently have a higher level of debt compared to historical periods as of september 2 2010 we had 24 billion of debt net of discounts of 247 million we may need to incur additional debt in the future our debt level could adversely impact us for example it could 

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

several of our credit facilities one of which was modified during 2009 and another of which was modified in 2010 have covenants that require us to maintain minimum levels of tangible net worth and cash and investments as of september 2 2010 we were in compliance with our debt covenants if we are unable to continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants or obtain waivers an event of default could be triggered which if not cured could cause the maturity of other borrowings to be accelerated and become due and currently payable 

 

covenants in our debt instruments may obligate us to repay debt increase contributions to our tech joint venture and limit our ability to obtain financing 

our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt may be affected by economic or business conditions or other events as of september 2 2010 our 87 owned tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd “tech” subsidiary had 348 million outstanding under a credit facility with covenants that among other requirements establish certain liquidity debt service coverage and leverage ratios for tech and restrict tech’s ability to incur indebtedness create liens and acquire or dispose of assets if tech does not comply with these debt covenants and restrictions this debt may be deemed to be in default and the debt declared payable there can be no assurance that tech will be able to comply with its covenants additionally if tech is unable to repay its borrowings when due the lenders under tech’s credit facility could proceed against substantially all of tech’s assets in the first quarter of 2010 tech amended certain of its debt covenants under the credit facility we have guaranteed 100 of the outstanding amount borrowed under tech’s credit facility if tech’s debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due existing covenant restrictions may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing to avoid covenant defaults we may be required to repay debt obligations or make additional contributions to tech all of which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap and are reported in us dollars across our multinational operations there are transactions and balances denominated in other currencies primarily the singapore dollar euro and yen we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 23 million for 2010 30 million for 2009 and of 25 million for 2008 we estimate that based on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as of september 2 2010 a 1 change in the exchange rate versus the us dollar would expose us to foreign currency gains or losses of approximately us 2 million for the singapore dollar and us 1 million for the euro and the yen  in the event that the us dollar weakens significantly compared to the singapore dollar euro and yen our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

  

 

the limited availability certain raw materials or capital equipment could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards in some cases materials are provided by a single supplier various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

our operations are dependent on our ability to procure advanced semiconductor equipment that enables the transition to lower cost manufacturing processes for certain key types of equipment including equipment scanners we are dependent on a single supplier in recent periods we have experienced difficulties in obtaining some equipment on a timely basis due to the supplier’s limited capacity our inability to obtain this equipment timely could adversely affect our ability to transition to next generation manufacturing processes and reduce costs delays in obtaining equipment could also impede our ability to ramp production at new facilities and increase our overall costs of the ramp if we are unable to obtain advanced semiconductor equipment timely our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we may incur additional material restructure charges in future periods 

in response to a severe downturn in the semiconductor memory industry and global economic conditions we implemented restructure initiatives that resulted in net charges of 70 million in 2009 and 33 million in 2008 the restructure initiatives included shutting down our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in boise suspending the production ramp of a new fabrication facility in singapore and other personnel cost reductions we may need to implement further restructure initiatives in future periods as a result of these initiatives we could incur restructure charges lose production output lose key personnel and experience disruptions in our operations and difficulties in delivering products timely 

 

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

sales to customers outside the united states approximated 83 of our consolidated net sales for 2010 in addition a substantial portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside the united states in particular a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are concentrated in singapore our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

  

 

our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited 

we have a valuation allowance against substantially all us net deferred tax assets as of september 2 2010 our federal state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards were 24 billion 20 billion and 290 million respectively if not utilized substantially all of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2022 to 2029 and the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2015 as of september 2 2010 our federal and state tax credit carryforwards were 188 million and 204 million respectively if not utilized substantially all of our federal and state tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2013 to 2030 as a consequence of prior business acquisitions utilization of the tax benefits for some of the tax carryforwards is subject to limitations imposed by section 382 of the internal revenue code and some portion or all of these carryforwards may not be available to offset any future taxable income the determination of the limitations is complex and requires significant judgment and analysis of past transactions 

if our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs additionally our control over operations at our im flash tech inotera mp mask and transform joint ventures is limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced minor disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment and equipment failures if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers’ requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

 

consolidation of industry participants and governmental assistance to some of our competitors may contribute to uncertainty in the semiconductor memory industry and negatively impact our ability to compete 

in recent years manufacturing supply has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices of dram nand flash and nor flash products and substantial operating losses by us and our competitors the operating losses as well as limited access to sources of financing have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants some of our competitors may try to enhance their capacity and lower their cost structure through consolidation consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments have provided or are considering significant financial assistance for some of our competitors

on may 5 2004 rambus inc “rambus” filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county against us and other dram suppliers alleging that the defendants harmed rambus by engaging in concerted and unlawful efforts affecting rambus dram “rdram” by eliminating competition and stifling innovation in the market for computer memory technology and computer memory chips rambus’ complaint alleges various causes of action under california state law including among other things a conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices a conspiracy to monopolize intentional interference with prospective economic advantage and unfair competition rambus alleges that it is entitled to actual damages of more than a billion dollars and seeks joint and several liability treble damages punitive damages a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint interest and attorneys’ fees and costs a trial date has not been scheduled 

a number of purported class action pricefixing lawsuits have been filed against us and other dram suppliers four cases have been filed in the us district court for the northern district of california asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that indirectly purchased dram andor products containing dram from various dram suppliers during the time period from april 1 1999 through at least june 30 2002 the complaints allege price fixing in violation of federal antitrust laws and various state antitrust and unfair competition laws and seek treble monetary damages restitution costs interest and attorneys’ fees in addition at least sixtyfour cases have been filed in various state courts asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of indirect purchasers of dram in july 2006 the attorneys general for approximately forty us states and territories filed suit in the us district court for the northern district of california the complaints allege among other things violations of the sherman act cartwright act and certain other states’ consumer protection and antitrust laws and seek joint and several damages trebled as well as injunctive and other relief on october 3 2008 the california attorney general filed a similar lawsuit in california superior court purportedly on behalf of local california government entities alleging among other things violations of the cartwright act and state unfair competition law on june 23 2010 we executed a settlement agreement resolving these purported classaction indirect purchaser cases and the pending cases of the attorneys general relating to alleged dram pricefixing in the united states subject to certain conditions including final court approval of the class settlements we agreed to pay a total of approximately 67 million in three equal installments over a twoyear period 

additionally three purported class action cases have been filed against us in the following canadian courts superior court district of montreal province of quebec ontario superior court of justice ontario and supreme court of british columbia vancouver registry british columbia the substantive allegations in these cases are similar to those asserted in the dram antitrust cases filed in the united states plaintiffs’ motion for class certification was denied in the british columbia and quebec cases in may and june 2008 respectively plaintiffs have filed an appeal of each of those decisions on november 12 2009 the british columbia court of appeal reversed the denial of class certification and remanded the case for further proceedings the appeal of the quebec case is still pending 

on february 28 2007 february 28 2007 and march 8 2007 cases were filed against us and other manufacturers of dram in the us district court for the northern district of california by all american semiconductor inc jaco electronics inc and dram claims liquidation trust respectively that optedout of a direct purchaser class action suit that was settled the complaints allege among other things violations of federal and state antitrust and competition laws in the dram industry and seek joint and several damages trebled as well as restitution attorneys’ fees costs and injunctive relief 

on june 21 2010 the brazil secretariat of economic law of the ministry of justice “sde” announced that it had initiated an investigation relating to alleged anticompetitive activities within the dram industry  the sde’s notice of investigation names various dram manufacturers and certain executives including ours and focuses on the period from july 1998 to june 2002 

on september 24 2010 oracle america inc “oracle” successor to sun microsystems a dram purchaser that optedout of a direct purchaser class action suit that was settled filed suit against us in us district court for the northern district of california the complaint alleges dram pricefixing and other violations of federal and state antitrust and unfair competition laws based on purported conduct for the period from august 1 1998 through at least june 15 2002 oracle is seeking joint and several damages trebled as well as restitution disgorgement attorneys’ fees costs and injunctive relief 

three purported class action lawsuits alleging pricefixing of “static random access memory” or “sram” products have been filed in canada asserting violations of the canadian competition act these cases assert claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that purchased sram products directly or indirectly from various sram suppliers 

  

  

 

in addition three purported class action lawsuits alleging pricefixing of flash products have been filed in canada asserting violations of the canadian competition act these cases assert claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that purchased flash memory directly and indirectly from various flash memory suppliers 

we are unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits the final resolution of these alleged violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

patent matters 

on august 28 2000 we filed a complaint against rambus in the us district court for the district of delaware seeking monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief among other things our complaint as amended alleges violation of federal antitrust laws breach of contract fraud deceptive trade practices and negligent misrepresentation the complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment a that we did not infringe on certain of rambus’ patents are invalid andor are unenforceable b that we have an implied license to those patents and c that rambus is estopped from enforcing those patents against us on february 15 2001 rambus filed an answer and counterclaim in delaware denying that we are entitled to relief alleging infringement of the eight rambus patents later amended to add four additional patents named in our declaratory judgment claim and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief in the delaware action we subsequently added claims and defenses based on rambus’ alleged spoliation of evidence and litigation misconduct the spoliation and litigation misconduct claims and defenses were heard in a bench trial before judge robinson in october 2007 on january 9 2009 judge robinson entered an opinion in favor of us holding that rambus had engaged in spoliation and that the twelve rambus patents in the suit were unenforceable against us rambus subsequently appealed the decision to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit that appeal is pending 

a number of other suits involving rambus are currently pending in europe alleging that certain of our sdram and ddr sdram products infringe various of rambus’ country counterparts to its european patent 525 068 including on september 1 2000 rambus filed suit against micron semiconductor deutschland gmbh in the district court of mannheim germany on september 22 2000 rambus filed a complaint against us and reptronic a distributor of our products in the court of first instance of paris france on september 29 2000 we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of milan italy alleging invalidity and noninfringement in addition on december 29 2000 we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of avezzano italy alleging invalidity and noninfringement of the italian counterpart to european patent 1 004 956 additionally on august 14 2001 rambus filed suit against micron semiconductor deutschland gmbh in the district court of mannheim germany alleging that certain of our ddr sdram products infringe rambus’ country counterparts to its european patent 1 022 642 in the european suits against us rambus is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief subsequent to the filing of the various european suits the european patent office the “epo” declared rambus’ 525 068 and 1 004 956 european patents invalid and revoked the patents the declaration of invalidity with respect to the ‘068 patent was upheld on appeal the original claims of the 956 patent also were declared invalid on appeal but the epo ultimately granted a rambus request to amend the claims by adding a number of limitations 

on january 13 2006 rambus filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california rambus alleges that certain of our ddr2 ddr3 rldram and rldram ii products infringe as many as fourteen rambus patents and seeks monetary damages treble damages and injunctive relief the accused products account for a significant portion of our net sales on june 2 2006 we filed an answer and counterclaim against rambus alleging among other things antitrust and fraud claims on january 9 2009 in another lawsuit involving us and rambus and involving allegations by rambus of patent infringement against us in the us district court for the district of delaware judge robinson entered an opinion in favor of us holding that rambus had engaged in spoliation and that the twelve rambus patents in the suit were unenforceable against us rambus subsequently appealed the delaware court’s decision to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit subsequently the northern district of california court stayed a trial of the patent phase of the northern district of california case pending the outcome of the appeal of the delaware court’s spoliation decision or further order of the california court

overview 

we are a global manufacturer and marketer of semiconductor devices principally dram nand flash and nor flash memory as well as other innovative memory technologies packaging solutions and semiconductor systems in addition we manufacture semiconductor components for cmos image sensors and other semiconductor products we market our products through our internal sales force independent sales representatives and distributors primarily to original equipment manufacturers and retailers located around the world our success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor products efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure successful ongoing development of advanced process technologies and the return on research and development investments see “part i  item 1 business” 

numonyx holdings bv “numonyx” on may 7 2010 we completed our acquisition of numonyx holdings bv “numonyx” which manufactures and sells nor flash nand flash dram and phase change memory technologies and products we acquired numonyx to   further strengthen our portfolio of memory products increase manufacturing and revenue scale access numonyx’s customer base and provide opportunities to increase multichip offerings in the embedded and mobile markets in connection therewith we issued 1377 million shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding numonyx capital stock and issued 48 million restricted stock units to the employees of numonyx in exchange for all of their outstanding restricted stock units the total fair value of the consideration we paid for numonyx was 1112 million and the net assets acquired were valued at 1549 million resulting in a gain of 437 million in addition we recognized a 51 million income tax benefit in connection with the acquisition our results of operations for 2010 include 635 million of net sales and 13 million of operating losses from the numonyx operations after the may 7 2010 acquisition date we incurred transaction costs of 20 million during 2010 in connection with the acquisition 

in connection with our purchase of numonyx on may 7 2010 we acquired a 207 noncontrolling equity interest in hynixnumonyx semiconductor ltd the “hynix jv” a joint venture with hynix semiconductor inc “hynix” and hynix semiconductor wuxi limited the change in control of numonyx gave hynix the right to purchase all of our equity interest in the hynix jv hynix exercised its right to purchase our interest in the hynix jv and consummated the equity transfer on august 31 2010 for 423 million concurrent with the numonyx acquisition we entered into agreements with stmicroelectronics nv and dbs bank ltd “dbs”   that required us to guarantee under certain conditions an outstanding loan made by dbs to the hynix jv and as a result recorded a 15 million liability as of the acquisition date the outstanding balance of the hynix jv loan was 250 million as of the acquisition date and is due in periodic installments from 2014 through 2016 under the agreements on august 31 2010 the conditions for the guarantee were satisfied and we deposited 250 million of proceeds from the sale of our interest in the hynix jv into a pledged account at dbs to collateralize our obligations under the guarantee of the loan the amount on deposit in the dbs account is accounted for as restricted cash the amount on deposit and our guarantee decrease as payments are made by the hynix jv against the loan

results of operations 

 

our fiscal year is the 52 or 53week period ending on the thursday closest to august 31 

amounts in the table above have been adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of new accounting standards for noncontrolling interests and certain convertible debt instruments see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – adjustment for retrospective application of new accounting standards” note 

in 2010 we added a new reportable segment as a result of the acquisition of numonyx and had two reportable segments memory and numonyx we included the former numonyx business as a reportable segment since its acquisition on may 7 2010 in 2009 we had two reportable segments memory and imaging in the first quarter of 2010 imaging no longer met the quantitative thresholds of a reportable segment and management does not expect that imaging will meet the quantitative thresholds in future years as a result imaging is no longer considered a reportable segment and is included in our all other nonreportable segments prior period amounts have been recast to reflect imaging in all other operating results of all other primarily reflect activity of imaging and also include activity of our microdisplay solar and other operations  the continued integration of numonyx into our operations will likely result in the redefinition of our reportable segments in 2011 

net sales 

total net sales for 2010 increased 77 as compared to 2009 primarily due to a 73 increase in memory sales and the addition of 635 million of sales from numonyx as a result of its acquisition in may 2010 the increase in memory sales for 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily reflects significant increases in gigabits sold and improved average selling prices for certain products total net sales for 2009 decreased 18 as compared to 2008 primarily due to a 17 decrease in memory sales and a 21 decrease in all other sales 

memory memory sales for 2010 increased 73 from 2009 primarily due to a 109 increase in sales of dram products and a 28 increase in sales of nand flash products 

  

  

 

sales of dram products for 2010 increased from 2009 primarily due to a 69 increase in gigabits sold and a 28 increase in average selling prices gigabit production of dram products increased 75 for 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to additional supply received from our inotera joint venture and production efficiencies achieved primarily through transitions to higher density advanced geometry devices dram products acquired from our inotera memories inc “inotera” joint venture accounted for 10 of our total net sales in 2010 as compared to less than 1 for 2009 we have rights and obligations to purchase 50 of inotera’s wafer production capacity under a supply agreement with inotera the “inotera supply agreement” we expect that our dram supply from inotera will increase significantly in 2011 due to inotera’s transition of its manufacturing from trench dram process technology to our stack dram technology the increase in average selling prices in 2010 for dram products from improved market conditions were partially offset by a shift in product mix resulting from increases sales of inotera trench dram products that had significantly lower average selling prices per gigabit than our other dram products sales of ddr2 and ddr3 dram our highest volume products were 46 of our total net sales for 2010 as compared to 29 of total net sales for 2009 and 2008 the increase in ddr2 and ddr3 dram sales in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily attributable to higher increases in average selling prices relative to our other products and the increased supply from inotera 

we sell nand flash products in three principal channels 1 to intel corporation “intel” through our im flash consolidated joint venture at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost 2 to original equipment manufacturers “oems” and other resellers and 3 to retailers aggregate sales of nand flash products for 2010 increased 28 from 2009 primarily due to a 55 increase in units sold partially offset by a 18 decline in average selling prices sales of nand flash products represented 28 of our total net sales for 2010 39 of our total net sales for 2009 and 35 of net sales for 2008 

sales through im flash to intel were 764 million for 2010 886 million for 2009 and 1037 million for 2008 gigabit sales to intel were 71 higher in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to a 68 increase in gigabit production of nand flash products over the same period production increases for nand flash were primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies achieved primarily through transitions to higher density advanced geometry devices we expect that the ramp of production at im flash’s new wafer fabrication facility in singapore will begin to increase our nand flash production in the second half of 2011 for 2010 average selling prices for im flash sales to intel decreased 49 as compared to 2009 due to reductions in costs per gigabit 

aggregate sales of nand flash products to our oem reseller and retail customers were 65 higher for 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to a 42 increase in gigabit sales average selling prices to our oem and reseller customers for 2010 increased 31 as compared to 2009 while average selling prices of our lexar brand which is directed primarily at the retail market decreased 16 

memory sales for 2009 decreased 17 from 2008 primarily due to a 23 decrease in sales of dram products and a 10 decrease in sales of nand flash products sales of dram products for 2009 decreased from 2008 primarily due to a 52 decline in average selling prices mitigated by a 56 increase in gigabits sold gigabit production of dram products increased 52 for 2009 despite the shutdown of the boise fabrication facility and production slowdowns at other 200mm wafer fabrication facilities sales of nand flash products for 2009 decreased 10 from 2008 due to a 15 decrease in sales to intel primarily due to the shutdown of nand flash production at the our boise wafer fabrication facility in 2009 and a 4 decrease in sales to oem resellers and retail customers primarily due a 52 decline in average selling prices partially offset by a 100 increase in gigabit sales 

we have formed partnering arrangements which have sold or licensed technology to other parties our memory segment recognized royalty and license revenue of 97 million in 2010 135 million in 2009 and 58 million in 2008 we have a partnering arrangement with nanya pursuant to which we and nanya jointly develop process technology and designs to manufacture stack dram products in addition we have deployed and licensed certain intellectual property related to the manufacture of stack dram products to nanya and licensed certain intellectual property from nanya we recognized 65 million 105 million and 37 million respectively of license revenue in net sales from this arrangement during 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively effective beginning in april 2010 the license agreement was completed and we generally share dram development costs with nanya equally our research and development costs for 2010 were reduced 51 million by this cost sharing arrangement in addition in 2010 we received 6 million of royalties from nanya for sales of stack dram products manufactured by or for nanya on process nodes of 50nm or higher and will continue to receive royalties from nanya associated with technology developed prior to april 2010 

  

  

 

numonyx numonyx segment sales for 2010 reflect sales subsequent to the may 7 2010 acquisition date of numonyx for this period numonyx segment sales were composed of approximately 70 nor flash products and approximately 30 nand flash products under business acquisition accounting we are unable to recognize revenue on sales of numonyx products that at the acquisition date were in the distribution channel and accounted for on a sellthrough basis such unrecognized revenue was 79 million for 2010 

gross margin 

our overall gross margin percentage improved to 32 for 2010 from negative 9 for 2009 primarily due to improvements in the gross margin for memory as a result of improved pricing and cost reductions overall gross margins were also impacted by our acquisition of numonyx in may of 2010 as the numonyx segment recorded gross margins of 19 for 2010 after the acquisition our overall gross margin percentage declined from negative 1 for 2008 to negative 9 for 2009 due to declines in the gross margins for both memory and all other primarily as a result of severe pricing pressure mitigated by cost reductions 

memory our gross margin percentage for memory products for 2010 improved to 35 from negative 12 for 2009 primarily due to improvements in the gross margins on sales of both dram and nand flash products 

our gross margins are impacted by charges to write down inventories to their estimated market values as a result of the significant decreases in average selling prices for both dram and nand flash products as charges to write down inventories are recorded in advance of when inventories are sold gross margins in subsequent reporting periods are higher than they otherwise would be the impact of inventory writedowns on gross margins for all periods reflects inventory writedowns less the estimated net effect of prior period writedowns the effects of inventory writedowns on memory gross margins by period were as follows 

 

in future periods we will be required to record additional inventory writedowns if estimated average selling prices of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarterend date are below the manufacturing cost of those products 

improvements in gross margins on sales of dram products for 2010 as compared to 2009 were primarily due to the 28 increase in average selling prices and a 35 reduction in costs per gigabit primarily as a result of improved production efficiencies dram products acquired from our inotera joint venture accounted for 10 total net sales in 2010 and our cost of wafers purchased under the inotera supply agreement is based on a margin sharing formula among nanya inotera and ourselves under such formula all parties’ manufacturing costs related to wafers supplied by inotera as well as our and nanya’s selling prices for the resale of products from wafers supplied by inotera are considered in determining costs for wafers acquired from inotera for 2010 we realized significantly lower gross margins on sales of inotera dram products than for sales of our other dram products gross margins on sales of dram products for 2010 did not include any costs for inotera’s underutilized capacity while in 2009 95 million of underutilized capacity costs were recorded 

our gross margin on sales of nand flash products for 2010 improved from 2009 primarily due to reductions in costs per gigabit of 42 as a result of lower manufacturing costs from increased production of higherdensity advancedgeometry devices the reductions in costs per gigabit on sales of nand flash products for 2010 were partially offset by the declines in average selling prices per gigabit of 18 gross margins on sales of nand flash products reflect sales of approximately half of im flash’s output to intel at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost our cost of goods sold on sales of nand flash products for 2010 and 2009 included 62 million and 61 million respectively of idle capacity costs from im flash’s wafer fabrication facility in singapore 

  

  

 

our gross margin percentage for memory products declined from negative 5 for 2008 to negative 12 for 2009 primarily due to declines in the gross margin for dram products partially offset by improvements in the gross margin for nand flash products gross margins for 2009 were positively affected by significant cost reductions for dram and nand flash products and the effects of selling memory products that were subject to inventory writedowns in 2008 declines in gross margins on sales of dram products for 2009 as compared to 2008 were primarily due to the 52 decline in average selling prices mitigated by 40 reduction in costs per gigabit the reduction in dram costs per gigabit was primarily due to production efficiencies dram production costs for 2009 were adversely impacted by 95 million of underutilized capacity costs from inotera our gross margin on sales of nand flash products for 2009 improved from 2008 despite a 56 decrease in overall average selling prices per gigabit primarily due to a 61 reduction in costs per gigabit primarily due to lower manufacturing costs 

numonyx numonyx segment gross margin for 2010 reflects operations subsequent to the may 7 2010 acquisition date of numonyx in acquisition accounting numonyx’s inventory was recorded at fair value reflecting its estimated selling price at the time of the acquisition which was approximately 185 million higher than the cost of inventory recorded by numonyx at the acquisition date of this amount approximately 67 million was reflected as an increase to numonyx cost of goods sold for 2010 and substantially all the remainder is expected to be reflected in cost of goods sold as the products are sold in 2011 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for 2010 increased 49 from 2009 primarily due to higher payroll expenses resulting from increased incentivebased compensation costs increased costs associated with legal matters including 64 million relating to accruals for estimated settlements in the indirect purchasers antitrust case and other matters in memory 20 million of numonyx acquisition costs and numonyx sga subsequent to the acquisition the increase in sga expenses for 2010 was reduced by a reduction in expenses for imaging operations as a result of the sale of a 65 interest in aptina imaging corporation “aptina” in the fourth quarter of 2009 we expect to incur increased sga expenses from numonyx operations for 2011 as compared to 2010 which only reflected numonyx’s operations from the may 7 2010 acquisition date sga expenses for 2009 decreased 22 from 2008 primarily due to lower payroll expenses and other costs related to our restructure initiatives and lower legal expenses lower payroll expenses reflected reductions in headcount variable pay salary levels and employee benefits future sga expense is expected to vary potentially significantly depending on among other things the number of legal matters that are resolved relatively early in their lifecycle and the number of legal matters that progress to trial we expect that sga expenses will approximate 140 million to 150 million for the first quarter of 2011 sga expense by segment were as follows 

 

research and development 

research and development “rd” expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification as costs incurred in production prior to qualification are charged to rd 

  

  

 

rd expenses for 2010 decreased 4 from 2009 primarily due to a dram costsharing arrangement with nanya that commenced in 2010 and a reduction in rd costs for imaging products as a result of the sale of a 65 interest in aptina in the fourth quarter of 2009 partially offset by higher payroll expenses resulting from the accrual of incentivebased compensation costs and additional rd expenses in connection with the may 7 2010 acquisition of numonyx rd expenses were reduced by 104 million in 2010 107 million in 2009 and 148 million in 2008 for amounts reimbursable from intel under a nand flash rd costsharing arrangement rd expenses were reduced by 51 million in 2010 for amounts reimbursable from nanya under a dram rd costsharing arrangement that commenced in the third quarter of 2010 we expect that reimbursements from nanya under the dram rd cost sharing arrangement will increase in 2011 when the arrangement is outstanding for the entire year we expect to incur increased rd expenses from numonyx’s operations in 2011 as compared to 2010 which only reflected numonyx’s operations from the may 7 2010 acquisition date we expect that rd expenses net of amounts reimbursable from our rd partners will approximate 195 million to 205 million for the first quarter of 2011 rd expenses for 2009 decreased 5 from 2008 primarily due to lower payroll costs and decreases in costs of development wafers processed 

rd expenses by segment were as follows 

 

 

 

our process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts are concentrated on our high density ddr3 dram and lpddr2 mobile lpdram products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including multilevel cell technology nor flash memory specialty memory phase change memory and memory systems 

restructure 

in response to a severe downturn in the semiconductor memory industry and global economic conditions we initiated a restructure plan in 2009 primarily within our memory segment in the first quarter of 2009 im flash our joint venture and intel terminated an agreement to obtain nand flash memory supply from our boise facility in connection therewith intel paid us 208 million in 2009 in addition we phased out all remaining 200mm dram wafer manufacturing operations in boise idaho in the second half of 2009 as a result of these restructure plans we reduced employment in 2009 by approximately 4600 employees or approximately 20 we do not expect to incur any additional material restructure charges related to the plan initiated in 2009   t he following table summarizes restructure charges credits resulting from the restructure activities 

 

  

  

 

goodwill impairment 

in the second quarter of 2009 our imaging operations the primary component of all other segment experienced a severe decline in sales margins and profitability due to a significant decline in demand as a result of the downturn in global economic conditions the drop in market demand resulted in significant declines in average selling prices and unit sales due to these market and economic conditions our imaging operations experienced a significant decline in market value accordingly in the second quarter of 2009 we performed an assessment of our imaging operations goodwill for impairment based on this assessment we wrote off all of the 58 million of goodwill associated with our imaging operations as of march 5 2009 

in the first and second quarters of 2008 we experienced a sustained significant decline in our stock price as a result of the decline in stock prices our market capitalization fell significantly below the recorded value of our consolidated net assets for most of the second quarter of 2008 the reduced market capitalization at that time reflected in part the memory segment’s lower average selling prices and expected continued weakness in pricing for our memory products accordingly in the second quarter of 2008 we performed an assessment of memory segment goodwill for impairment based on this assessment we wrote off all the 463 million of goodwill associated with our memory segment as of february 28 2008 

other operating income expense net 

other operating income expense consisted of the following 

 

interest incomeexpense 

interest expense for 2010 2009 and 2008 includes aggregate amounts of noncash amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of 76 million 71 million and 49 million respectively as a result of the retrospective adoption of a new accounting standard for certain convertible debt we modified our accounting for our 13 billion 1875 convertible notes we retrospectively allocated the 13 billion aggregate proceeds at inception between a liability component issued at a discount and an equity component the debt discount is being amortized from issuance through june 2014 the maturity date of the 1875 convertible notes with the amortization recorded as additional noncash interest expense included in the noncash interest expense above is amortization on the 1875 convertible notes of 56 million in 2010 52 million in 2009 and 47 million in 2008 see “item 1 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – adjustments for retrospective application of new accounting standards” note 

other nonoperating income expense net 

on august 3 2009 inotera sold common shares in a public offering as a result our interest in inotera decreased from 355 to 298 and we recognized a gain of 56 million in the first quarter of 2010 see “item 8 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – supplemental balance sheet information – equity method investments – inotera and meiya dram joint ventures with nanya – inotera” note 

income taxes 

income taxes for 2010 include a benefit of 51 million from reduction of a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in connection with the sale of our equity interest in the hynix jv that was acquired as part of the numonyx acquisition except for this benefit taxes for 2010 and 2009 primarily reflect taxes on our nonus operations and us alternative minimum tax we have a valuation allowance against substantially all us net deferred tax assets taxes attributable to us operations for 2010 2009 and 2008 were substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowance 

  

  

 

we have a valuation allowance against substantially all us net deferred tax assets as of september 2 2010 the federal state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards were 24 billion 20 billion and 290 million respectively if not utilized substantially all of the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in 2022 to 2029 and the foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2015 as of september 2 2010 the federal and state tax credit carryforwards were 188 million and 204 million respectively if not utilized substantially all of the federal and state tax credit carryforwards will expire in 2013 to 2030 as a consequence of prior business acquisitions utilization of the tax benefits for some of the tax carryforwards is subject to limitations imposed by section 382 of the internal revenue code and some portion or all of these carryforwards may not be available to offset any future taxable income the determination of the limitations is complex and requires significant judgment and analysis of past transactions 

in connection with the acquisition of numonyx we accrued a 66 million liability related to uncertain tax positions on the tax years of numonyx open to examination we have recorded an indemnification asset for a significant portion of these accrued liabilities related to these tax positions 

equity in net losses of equity method investees 

we have partnered with nanya in two taiwan dram memory companies accounted for as equity method investments inotera and meiya technology corporation “meiya” inotera and meiya each have fiscal years that end on december 31 we recognize our share of inotera’s and meiya’s quarterly earnings or losses on a twomonth lag from our interest in these equity method investments we recognized a loss of 5 million for 2010 and a loss of 140 million for 2009 

as a result of our sale of a 65 interest in our aptina subsidiary on july 10 2009 we account for our remaining interest in aptina under the equity method our shares in aptina constitute 35 of aptina’s total common and preferred stock and 64 of aptina’s common stock under the equity method we recognize our share of aptina’s results of operations based on our 64 share of aptina’s common stock on a twomonth lag we recognized losses of 24 million on our investment in aptina for 2010 

on december 18 2009 we acquired a 50 interest in transform a subsidiary of origin energy limited “origin” in exchange for our contribution to transform of nonmonetary manufacturing assets with a fair value of 65 million we recognize our 50 share of transform’s results of operations on a twomonth lag our results of operations for 2010 included a loss of 12 million for our share of transform’s results of operations from the acquisition date through june 30 2010 

see “item 8 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – supplemental balance sheet information – equity method investments” note 

noncontrolling interests in net income loss 

noncontrolling interests for 2010 2009 and 2008 primarily reflects the share of income or losses attributed to the noncontrolling interests in our tech joint venture we made the following purchases of tech shares 99 million on february 27 2009 99 million on june 2 2009 and 60 million on august 27 2009 as a result noncontrolling interests in tech were reduced from approximately 27 as of august 28 2008 to approximately 15 as of september 3 2009 we purchased an additional 80 million of tech shares on january 27 2010 and further reduced noncontrolling interest in tech to approximately 13 as of september 2 2010 see “item 8 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd” note 

stockbased compensation 

total compensation cost for our equity plans for 2010 2009 and 2008 was 93 million 44 million and 48 million respectively stockbased compensation expense was higher for 2010 than for 2009 primarily due to the accrual of performancebased stock compensation costs as a result of improved operating results stock compensation expenses fluctuate based on assessments of whether the achievement of performance conditions is probable for performancebased stock grants 

  

  

 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of september 2 2010 we had cash and equivalents totaling 2913 million compared to 1485 million as of september 3 2009 the balance as of september 2 2010 included 355 million held at our tech joint venture and 246 million held at our im flash joint ventures our ability to access funds held by the joint ventures to finance our other operations is subject to agreement by the joint venture partners debt covenants and contractual limitations amounts held by tech and im flash are not anticipated to be available to finance our other operations 

our cash and equivalents were composed of the following as of september 2 2010 

 

to mitigate credit risk we invest through highcreditquality financial institutions and by policy generally limit the concentration of credit exposure by restricting investments with any single obligor 

our liquidity is highly dependent on average selling prices for our products and the timing of capital expenditures both of which can vary significantly from period to period depending on conditions in the semiconductor memory market our cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash and investments may not be adequate to meet our needs for capital expenditures and operations historically we have used external sources of financing to fund these needs due to conditions in the credit markets it may be difficult to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us 

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 3096 million for 2010 which reflected approximately 3530 million generated from the production and sales of our products partially offset by a 516 million increase in accounts receivable due to a higher level of sales and in an increase in the proportion of sales to original equipment manufacturers who generally have longer payment terms than other customers 

on october 1 2010 we entered into a 10year patent crosslicense agreement with samsung electronics co ltd “samsung” under the agreement samsung will pay us 275 million with 200 million paid in october 2010 40 million due january 31 2011 and 35 million due march 31 2011 the license is a lifeofpatents license for existing patents and applications and a 10year term license for all other patents 

investing activities net cash used for investing activities was 448 million for 2010 which included cash expenditures of 616 million for property plant and equipment and 138 million for the acquisition of additional shares in inotera partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of our interest in the hynix jv of 173 million net of 250 million placed in a cash collateral account for a loan guarantee a significant portion of the capital expenditures related to im flash and tech operations we believe that to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and capital equipment and research and development we expect that capital spending will be approximately 24 billion to 29 billion for 2011 the actual amount in 2011 will vary depending on funding participation by joint venture partners and market conditions as of september 2 2010 we had commitments of approximately 12 billion for the acquisition of property plant and equipment most of which is expected to be paid within one year 

in connection with the numonyx acquisition we acquired a 207 noncontrolling interest in the hynix jv subsequent to the acquisition hynix exercised its option to purchase our equity interest in the hynix jv for 423 million on august 31 2010 also in connection with the numonyx acquisition we entered into agreements with stmicroelectronics nv and dbs bank ltd “dbs”   that require us to guarantee an outstanding 250 million loan due in periodic installments from 2014 through 2016 made by dbs to the hynix jv under the agreements on august 31 2010 we deposited 250 million of proceeds from the sale of our interest in the hynix jv into a pledged account at dbs bank ltd “dbs” to collateralize the guarantee of the loan the amount on deposit in the dbs account is accounted for as restricted cash the amount on deposit and our guarantee decrease as payments are made by the hynix jv against the loan 

financing activities net cash used for financing activities was 1220 million for 2010 which includes payments of debt net of proceeds received of 640 million debt payments included 213 million to repay a note with the singapore economic development board 200 million to reduce the amount outstanding under the tech credit facility and 70 million to repay the lexar convertible notes cash used for financing activities also includes 330 million of payments on equipment purchase contracts and 229 million of net distributions to joint venture partners 

  

  

 

tech’s credit facility contains covenants that among other requirements establish certain liquidity debt service coverage and leverage ratios and restrict its ability to incur indebtedness create liens and acquire or dispose of assets in the first quarter of 2010 the covenants were modified and as of september 2010 tech was in compliance with the covenants we guarantee 100 of the 348 million outstanding amount borrowed under the tech credit facility as of september 2 2010 under the terms of the credit facility tech had 60 million in restricted cash as of september 2 2010 

see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – supplemental balance sheet information – debt” note 

joint ventures in 2010 im flash distributed 267 million to intel and we expect that it will make additional distributions to intel in the future timing of these distributions and any future contributions however is subject to market conditions and approval of the partners in the second quarter of 2010 im flash began moving forward with startup activities including placing purchase orders and preparing the facility for tool installations at its new 300mm wafer fabrication facility in singapore that commenced in 2011 in 2010 we contributed 128 million and intel contributed 38 million to im flash in the first quarter of 2011 we contributed 392 million to im flash and intel did not make any contribution we expect to make significant contributions to im flash in future periods in connection with these startup activities the level of our future capital contributions to im flash will depend on the extent to which intel participates with us in future im flash capital calls 

we made capital contributions to tech of 80 million in 2010 and 258 million in 2009 increasing our equity interest in tech to 87 the shareholders’ agreement for the tech joint venture expires in april 2011 in september 2009 tech received a notice from hewlettpackard company “hp” that it does not intend to extend the tech joint venture beyond april 2011 we are in discussions with hp and canon inc “canon” to reach a resolution of the matter which may include our purchase of their interests the parties’ inability to reach a resolution prior to april 2011 could result in the sale of tech’s assets and could require repayment of tech’s credit facility 348 million outstanding as of september 2 2010 see item 1a risk factors 

on december 15 2009 inotera’s board of directors approved the issuance of 640 million common shares on february 6 2010 we purchased approximately 196 million shares for 138 million slightly increasing our equity interest in inotera from 298 to 299 

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of september 2 2010 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

 

the obligations disclosed above do not include contractual obligations recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities except for the current portion of longterm debt the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services market prices changes to agreedupon amounts or timing of certain events for some obligations 

purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria 1 they are noncancelable 2 we would incur a penalty if the agreement was cancelled or 3 we must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take delivery of the contracted products or services “takeorpay” if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable the entire value of the contract was included in the above table if the obligation is cancelable but we would incur a penalty if cancelled the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation contracted minimum amounts specified in takeorpay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment 

  

  

 

pursuant to the inotera supply agreement we have an obligation to purchase 50 of inotera’s output of semiconductor memory components subject to specific terms and conditions as purchase quantities are based on qualified production output the inotera supply agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity and therefore we did not include our obligations under the inotera supply agreement in the contractual obligations table above our obligation under the inotera supply agreement also fluctuates due to pricing which is based on manufacturing costs and margins associated with the resale of dram products pursuant to our obligations under the inotera supply agreement we purchased 693 million of dram products from inotera in 2010 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with the acquisition of numonyx we entered into agreements with stmicroelectronics nv and dbs that require us to guarantee an outstanding 250 million loan due in periodic installments from 2014 through 2016 made by dbs to the hynix jv under the agreements on august 31 2010 we deposited 250 million of proceeds from the sale of our interest in the hynix jv into a pledged account at dbs to collateralize our obligations under the guarantee of the loan the amount on deposit in the dbs account is accounted for as restricted cash the amount on deposit and our guarantee decrease as payments are made by the hynix jv against the loan as of september 2 2010 other noncurrent liabilities included 15 million for the fair value of our obligations under our agreements with stmicroelectronics and dbs see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – supplemental balance sheet information – equity method investments – hynix jv” note 

concurrent with the offering of the 1875 convertible notes in may 2007 we paid approximately 151 million for three capped call transactions the “capped calls” the capped calls cover an aggregate of approximately 913 million shares of common stock the capped calls are in three equal tranches with cap prices of 1725 2013 and 2300 per share respectively each with an initial strike price of approximately 1423 per share subject to certain adjustments the capped calls expire on various dates between november 2011 and december 2012 the capped calls are intended to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible notes 

concurrent with the offering of the 425 senior notes in april 2009 we paid approximately 25 million for three capped call instruments that have an initial strike price of approximately 508 per share the “2009 capped calls” the 2009 capped calls have a cap price of 664 per share and cover an aggregate of approximately 452 million shares of common stock the capped calls expire in october and november of 2012 the 2009 capped calls are intended to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of the 425 senior notes 

see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – supplemental balance sheet information – shareholders’ equity – capped call transactions” note 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in may 2008 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued a new accounting standard for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement this standard requires that issuers of these types of convertible debt instruments separately account for the liability and equity components of such instruments in a manner such that interest cost is recognized at the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate in subsequent periods we adopted this standard as of the beginning of 2010 and retrospectively accounted for our 13 billion 1875 convertible senior notes under the provisions of this guidance from the may 2007 issuance date of the notes as a result prior financial statement amounts were recast see “adjustments for retrospective application of new accounting standards” note 

in december 2007 the fasb issued a new accounting standard on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements this standard requires that 1 noncontrolling interests be reported as a separate component of equity 2 net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be separately identified in the statement of operations 3 changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest be accounted for as equity transactions and 4 any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary be initially measured at fair value we adopted this standard as of the beginning of 2010 as a result prior financial statement amounts were recast see “adjustments for retrospective application of new accounting standards” note 

  

  

 

in december 2007 the fasb issued a new accounting standard on business combinations which establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer 1 recognizes and measures in its financial statements identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree 2 recognizes and measures goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and 3 determines what information to disclose we adopted this standard effective as of the beginning of 2010 the initial adoption did not have a significant impact on our financial statements the acquisition of numonyx was accounted for under the provisions of this new standard   see “numonyx holdings bv” note 

in september 2006 the fasb issued a new accounting standard on fair value measurements and disclosures which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements we adopted this standard effective as of the beginning of 2009 for financial assets and financial liabilities we adopted this standard effective as of the beginning of 2010 for all other assets and liabilities the adoptions did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 

recently issued accounting standards 

in june 2009 the fasb issued a new accounting standard on variable interest entities which 1 replaces the quantitativebased risks and rewards calculation for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity with an approach that is primarily qualitative 2 requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and 3 requires additional disclosures about an enterprise’s involvement in variable interest entities  we are required to adopt this standard as of the beginning of 2011 we do not expect the initial adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our financial statements as of the adoption date the impact on periods subsequent to the initial adoption will depend on the nature and extent of our variable interest entities after the beginning of 2011 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted future events and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis our management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

acquisitions accounting for acquisitions and consolidations requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets and liabilities acquired as well as various forms of consideration given which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized we typically obtain independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values 

consolidations determining whether to consolidate a variable interest entity may require judgment in assessing 1 whether an entity is a variable interest entity and 2 if we are the entity’s primary beneficiary we are required to consolidate a variable interest entity if we have variable interests that will absorb a   majority of the entity’s expected losses receive a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns or both determining the primary beneficiary requires consideration of the rights and obligations conveyed by our variable interests and the relationship of our variable interests with variable interests held by other parties if we hold variable interests in the same variable interest entity with another entity that is considered a related party we are required to assess whether we are the primary beneficiary based on a determination of who is most closely associated with the variable interest entity this assessment requires judgment and shall be based on an analysis of all relevant facts and circumstances including 1 the relationship and significance of the activities of the variable interest entity to the various parties within the related party group 2 each party’s exposure to the expected losses of the variable interest entity and 3 the design of the variable interest entity in 2011 upon adoption of a new accounting standard the determination of the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity will require an assessment of whether we have the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance 

 

  

  

 

contingencies we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 

income taxes we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year we are also required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of our performance and other relevant factors realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income 

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value and we recorded charges of 603 million in aggregate for 2009 and 282 million in aggregate for 2008 to write down the carrying value of inventories of memory products to their estimated market values cost includes labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes we review recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analysis of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated market values below our manufacturing costs we record a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated market value of our memory segment inventory by approximately 105 million at september 2 2010 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories our inventories have been categorized as memory numonyx imaging and microdisplay products the major characteristics we consider in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 

product and process technology costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by ourselves are capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over periods currently ranging up to 10 years we capitalize a portion of costs incurred based on our analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents filed capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of 1 the estimated useful life of the technology 2 the patent term or 3 the term of the technology agreement 

property plant and equipment we review the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by us include but are not limited to future use of the assets for our operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for our products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required by us in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

research and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment y us we deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are valued in inventory 

stockbased compensation compensation cost for stockbased compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fairvalue of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award for stockbased compensation awards with graded vesting that were granted after 2005 we recognize compensation expense using the straightline amortization method for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved we utilize forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgment 

  

  

 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates we develop its estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation we use the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards we estimate stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

as of september 2 2010 1810 million of our 2360 million of debt was at fixed interest rates as a result the fair value of our debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates the estimated fair value of our debt was 2565 million as of september 2 2010 and 2868 million as of september 3 2009 we estimate that as of september 2 2010 a 1 decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our fixedrate debt instruments by approximately 49 million as of september 2 2010 550 million of the debt had variable interest rates and a 1 increase in the rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately 4 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in “item 1a risk factors” changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the functional currency for substantially all of our operations is the us dollar we held cash and other assets in foreign currencies valued at an aggregate of us 504 million as of september 2 2010 and us 229 million as of september 3 2009 we also had foreign currency liabilities valued at an aggregate of us 901 million as of september 2 2010 and us 742 million as of september 3 2009 significant components of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were as follows in us dollar equivalents 

 

we estimate that based on the assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as of september 2 2010 a 1 change in the exchange rate versus the us dollar would expose us to foreign currency gains or losses of approximately us 2 million for the singapore dollar and us 1 million for the euro and the yen during the first quarter of 2010 we began using derivative instruments to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk see item 8 financial statements – “derivative financial instruments” note

manufacturing 

the company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china italy japan puerto rico and singapore the company’s inotera joint venture also has a wafer fabrication facility in taiwan the company’s manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment most semiconductor equipment must be replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment 

the company’s process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment the company is continuously enhancing its production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products the company was transitioning its dram production to 50nm linewidth process technology in 2009 and expects that most of its dram products will be manufactured using its 50nm linewidth process technology in the second half of 2010 in 2009 the company manufactured the majority of its nand flash memory products using its 34nm linewidth process technology in 2010 the company expects to transition to a lower linewidth process technology for its manufacture of nand flash memory products in 2009 the company manufactured substantially all of its highvolume memory products on 300mm wafers the company manufactured some specialty dram and imaging products using 200mm wafers 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls dust particles equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks and circuit design marginalities or defects can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional success of the company’s manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard the company employs rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes the company is able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

after fabrication silicon wafers are separated into individual die the company sells semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie “bare die” forms for packaged products functional die are sorted connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages the company assembles products in a variety of packages including tsop thin small outline package tqfp thin quad flat package and fbga fine pitch ball grid array bare die products address customer requirements for smaller form factors and higher memory densities and provide superior flexibility bare die products are used in packaging technologies such as systemsinapackage sips and multichip packages mcps which reduce the board area required 

the company tests its products at various stages in the manufacturing process performs high temperature burnin on finished products and conducts numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition the company uses its proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of dram die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

the company assembles a significant portion of its memory products into memory modules memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards “pcbs” that insert directly into computer systems or other electronic devices the company’s lexar subsidiary contracts with independent foundries and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices 

the company utilizes subcontractors to perform a significant portion of its assembly test and module assembly services outsourcing these services enables the company to reduce costs and minimize its capital investment 

in recent years the company has produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances the company’s ability to allocate resources to its most profitable products but also increases the complexity of its manufacturing process although the company’s product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes the company’s overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines 

nand flash joint ventures with intel corporation the company has formed two joint ventures with intel to manufacture nand flash memory products for the exclusive benefit of the partners im flash technologies llc and im flash singapore llp collectively “im flash” im flash manufactures nand flash memory products using nand flash designs developed by the company and intel the parties share the output of im flash generally in proportion to their investment in im flash the company owned a 51 interest in im flash at september 3 2009 im flash’s financial results are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company 

in the first quarter of 2009 im flash substantially completed construction of a new 300mm wafer fabrication facility structure in singapore the singapore facility has not been equipped and in october 2008 the company and intel agreed to suspend tooling and the ramp of nand flash production at the facility see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – consolidated variable interest entities – nand flash joint ventures with intel”

availability of raw materials 

the company’s production processes require raw materials that meet exacting standards including several that are customized for or unique to the company the company generally has multiple sources and sufficient availability of supply however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet the company’s standards various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases lead frames molding compound and other materials in addition any transportation problems could delay the company’s receipt of raw materials although raw materials shortages or transportation problems have not interrupted the company’s operations in the past shortages may occur from time to time in the future also lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if the company’s supply of raw materials is interrupted or lead times are extended results of operations could be adversely affected 

marketing and customers 

the company’s products are sold into computing consumer networking telecommunications and imaging markets approximately 30 of the company’s net sales for 2009 were to the computing market including desktop pcs servers notebooks and workstations sales to intel primarily for nand flash from the im flash joint ventures were 20 of the company’s net sales in 2009 and 19 of the company’s net sales in 2008 sales to hewlettpackard company were 10 of the company’s net sales in 2007 

the company’s memory products are offered under the micron lexar crucial and spectek brand names and private labels the company markets its semiconductor products primarily through its own direct sales force and maintains sales offices in its primary markets around the world the company maintains inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products the company sells lexarbranded nand flash memory products primarily through retail channels and its crucialbranded products primarily through a webbased customer direct sales channel the company’s products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by the company and are compensated on a commission basis the company makes shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry the company’s products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors’ products 

the company offers products designed to meet the diverse needs of computing server automotive networking security commercialindustrial consumer electronics medical and mobile applications many of the company’s customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several months as the company further diversifies its product lines and reduces the die sizes of existing products more products become subject to qualification which may delay volume introduction of specific devices by the company 

backlog 

because of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for the company’s semiconductor products fluctuate significantly orders are typically accepted with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment customers can change delivery schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty for these reasons the company does not believe that its order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

  

  

product warranty 

because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that the company may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice the company generally provides a limited warranty that its products are in compliance with company specifications existing at the time of delivery under the company’s general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances the company provides more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under the company’s general terms and conditions 

competition 

the company faces intense competition in the semiconductor memory markets from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation and toshiba corporation some of the company’s competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which the company competes invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities the company’s competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product design resulting in significantly increased worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices 

research and development 

the company’s process technology research and development “rd” efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate the company’s transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage the company’s core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts are concentrated on the company’s high density ddr3 and mobile products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including mlc technology specialty memory products and memory systems the company’s rd expenses were 647 million 680 million and 805 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

to compete in the semiconductor memory industry the company must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes the company believes that expansion of its semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory and imaging solutions the company’s process development center and largest design center are located at its corporate headquarters in boise idaho the company has several additional product design centers in other strategic locations around the world in addition the company develops leading edge photolithography mask technology at its mp mask joint venture facility in boise 

rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture its products the company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification the company and intel share rd process and design costs for nand flash equally the company and nanya also jointly develop process technology and designs to manufacture stack dram products with each party bearing its own development costs

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company 

we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business 

for 2009 average selling prices of dram and nand flash products decreased 52 and 56 respectively as compared to 2008 for 2008 average selling prices of dram and nand flash products decreased 51 and 67 respectively as compared to 2007 for 2007 average selling prices of dram and nand flash products decreased 23 and 56 respectively as compared to 2006 in some prior periods average selling prices for our memory products have been below our manufacturing costs if average selling prices for our memory products remain depressed or decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs as they recently have our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology facilities and capital equipment research and development and product and process technology we currently estimate our capital spending to be between 750 million and 850 million for 2010 as of september 3 2009 we had cash and equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 1485 million of which 302 million consisted of cash and investments of im flash and tech that would generally not be available to finance our other operations in the past we have utilized external sources of financing when needed and access to capital markets has historically been very important to us as a result of the severe downturn in the semiconductor memory market the downturn in general economic conditions and the adverse conditions in the credit markets it may be difficult to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us we significantly reduced our actual capital expenditures for 2009 and planned capital expenditures for 2010 in addition we are considering further financing alternatives continuing to limit capital expenditures and implementing further costcutting initiatives there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency or access capital markets our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at the rate average selling prices decline 

our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes including reducing the die size of our existing products in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to improve or maintain gross margins factors that many limit our ability to reduce costs include but are not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes changes in process technologies or products that inherently may require relatively larger die sizes per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products 

consolidation of industry participants and governmental assistance to some of our competitors may contribute to uncertainty in the semiconductor market and negatively impact our ability to compete 

in recent periods manufacturing supply has significantly exceeded customer demand resulting in significant declines in average selling prices of dram and nand flash products and substantial operating losses by the company and its competitors the operating losses as well as limited access to sources of financing have led to the deterioration in the financial condition of a number of industry participants some of our competitors may try to enhance their capacity and lower their cost structure through consolidation consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage in addition some governments have provided or are considering significant financial assistance for some of our competitors 

  

  

the recent economic downturn in the worldwide economy and the semiconductor industry may harm our business 

the downturn in the worldwide economy including a continuing downturn in the semiconductor memory industry had an adverse effect on our business adverse economic conditions affect consumer demand for devices that incorporate our products such as personal computers mobile phones flash memory cards and usb devices reduced demand for our products could result in continued market oversupply and significant decreases in our average selling prices a continuation of current negative conditions in worldwide credit markets would limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation and toshiba corporation some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources or greater access to resources including governmental resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs the transitions to smaller linewidth process technologies and 300mm wafers in the industry have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our joint ventures and strategic partnerships involve numerous risks 

we have entered into partnering arrangements to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these arrangements include our im flash nand flash joint ventures with intel our inotera dram joint venture with nanya our tech dram joint venture our mp mask joint venture with photronics and our cmos image sensor wafer supply agreement with aptina  these joint ventures and strategic partnerships are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if our joint ventures and strategic partnerships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

  

our ownership interest in inotera memories inc involves numerous risks 

in the first quarter of 2009 we acquired a 355 ownership interest in inotera memories inc a publicly traded taiwanese dram memory manufacturer from qimonda ag in august 2009 our ownership interest in inotera was reduced to 298 as a result of inotera’s issuance of common stock in a public offering for approximately 310 million in connection with our interest in inotera we also have rights and obligations to purchase up to 50 of the wafer production of inotera our acquisition of an interest in inotera involves numerous risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant to our obligations under a supply agreement with inotera we recorded 95 million of charges in cost of goods sold in 2009 related to underutilized capacity and purchased 46 million of trench dram products from inotera 

we may incur additional restructure charges in future periods 

in response to a severe downturn in the semiconductor memory industry and global economic conditions we implemented restructure initiatives in 2009 2008 and 2007 that resulted in net charges of 70 million 33 million and 19 million respectively the restructure initiatives included shutting down our 200mm wafer fabrication facility in boise suspending the production ramp of a new fabrication facility in singapore and other personnel cost reductions depending on market conditions in future periods we may implement further restructure initiatives as a result of these initiatives we could incur restructure charges lose production output lose key personnel and experience disruptions in our operations and difficulties in delivering products timely 

  

  

an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

on january 13 2006 rambus inc “rambus” filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california rambus alleges that certain of our ddr2 ddr3 rldram and rldram ii products infringe as many as fourteen rambus patents and seeks monetary damages treble damages and injunctive relief the accused products account for a significant portion of our net sales on june 2 2006 we filed an answer and counterclaim against rambus alleging among other things antitrust and fraud claims on january 9 2009 in another lawsuit involving the company and rambus and involving allegations by rambus of patent infringement against us in the us district court for the district of delaware judge robinson entered an opinion in favor of us holding that rambus had engaged in spoliation and that the twelve rambus patents in the suit were unenforceable against the company rambus subsequently appealed the delaware court’s decision to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit subsequently the northern district of california court stayed a trial of on the patent phase of the northern district of california case pending the outcome of the appeal of the delaware court’s spoliation decision or further order of the california court see “item 3 legal proceedings” for additional details on this lawsuit and other rambus matters pending in the us and europe 

on march 6 2009 panavision imaging llc filed suit against the company and aptina imaging corporation then a whollyowned subsidiary of the company in the us district court for the central district of california the complaint alleges that certain of the company and aptina’s image sensor products infringe four panavision imaging us patents and seeks injunctive relief damages attorneys’ fees and costs 

on march 24 2009 accolade systems llc filed suit against the company and aptina in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging that certain of the company and aptina’s image sensor products infringe one accolade systems us patent the complaint seeks injunctive relief damages attorneys’ fees and costs accolade systems never served the complaint and on october 15 2009 filed a motion to dismiss the complaint against the company and aptina without prejudice 

we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

an adverse outcome relating to allegations of anticompetitive conduct could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

a number of purported class action pricefixing lawsuits have been filed against us and other dram suppliers numerous cases have been filed in various state and federal courts asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that indirectly purchased dram andor products containing dram from various dram suppliers during the time period from april 1 1999 through at least june 30 2002 the complaints allege violations of the various jurisdictions’ antitrust consumer protection andor unfair competition laws relating to the sale and pricing of dram products and seek joint and several damages trebled restitution costs interest and attorneys’ fees a number of these cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the us district court for the northern district of california san francisco for consolidated pretrial proceedings on january 29 2008 the northern district of california court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the plaintiff’s second amended consolidated complaint the district court subsequently certified the decision for interlocutory appeal on february 27 2008 plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint on june 26 2008 the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit agreed to consider plaintiffs’ interlocutory appeal see “item 3 legal proceedings” for additional details on these cases and related matters 

various states through their attorneys general have filed suit against us and other dram manufacturers alleging violations of state and federal competition laws the amended complaint alleges among other things violations of the sherman act cartwright act and certain other states’ consumer protection and antitrust laws and seeks damages and injunctive and other relief on october 3 2008 the california attorney general filed a similar lawsuit in california superior court purportedly on behalf of local california government entities alleging among other things violations of the cartwright act and state unfair competition law see “item 3 legal proceedings” for additional details on these cases and related matters 

 

three purported class action lawsuits alleging pricefixing of flash products have been filed against us in canada asserting violations of the canadian competition act these cases assert claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that purchased flash memory directly and indirectly from various flash memory suppliers see “item 3 legal proceedings” for additional details on these cases and related matters 

on may 5 2004 rambus filed a lawsuit in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county against us and other dram suppliers the complaint alleges various causes of action under california state law including conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices of rambus dram rdram and unfair competition the complaint seeks joint and several damages trebled punitive damages attorneys’ fees costs and a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint trial is currently scheduled to begin in january 2010 see “item 3 legal proceedings” for additional details on this case and other rambus matters pending in the us and europe 

we are unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits an adverse court determination in any of these lawsuits alleging violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

an adverse outcome relating to allegations of violations of securities laws could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

on february 24 2006 a number of purported class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our officers in the us district court for the district of idaho alleging claims under section 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and rule 10b5 promulgated thereunder the cases purport to be brought on behalf of a class of purchasers of our stock during the period february 24 2001 to february 13 2003 the five lawsuits have been consolidated and a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed on july 24 2006 the complaint generally alleges violations of federal securities laws based on among other things claimed misstatements or omissions regarding alleged illegal pricefixing conduct the complaint seeks unspecified damages interest attorneys fees costs and expenses on december 19 2007 the court issued an order certifying the class but reducing the class period to purchasers of our stock during the period from february 24 2001 to september 18 2002 see “item 3 legal proceedings” for additional details on these cases and related matters 

we are unable to predict the outcome of these cases an adverse court determination in any of the class action lawsuits against us could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

our debt level is higher than compared to historical periods 

we currently have a higher level of debt compared to historical periods as of september 3 2009 we had 31 billion of debt we may need to incur additional debt in the future our debt level could adversely impact us for example it could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

several of our credit facilities one of which was modified during 2009 have covenants which require us to maintain minimum levels of tangible net worth and cash and investments as of september 3 2009 we were in compliance with our debt covenants if we are unable to continue to be in compliance with our debt covenants or obtain waivers an event of default could be triggered which if not cured could cause the maturity of other borrowings to be accelerated and become due and currently payable 

covenants in our debt instruments may obligate us to repay debt increase contributions to our tech joint venture and limit our ability to obtain financing 

our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt may be affected by economic or business conditions or other events as of september 3 2009 our 85 owned tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd “tech” subsidiary had 548 million outstanding under a credit facility with covenants that among other requirements establish certain liquidity debt service coverage and leverage ratios for tech and restrict tech’s ability to incur indebtedness create liens and acquire or dispose of assets if tech does not comply with these debt covenants and restrictions this debt may be deemed to be in default and the debt declared payable there can be no assurance that tech will be able to comply with its covenants additionally if tech is unable to repay its borrowings when due the lenders under tech’s credit facility could proceed against substantially all of tech’s assets in the first quarter of 2010 tech modified its debt covenants in connection with the modification our guarantee of tech’s debt increased from approximately 73 to approximately 85 of the outstanding amount borrowed under tech’s credit facility our guarantee could increase up to 100 of the outstanding amount borrowed under the facility based on further increases in our ownership interest in tech and other conditions if tech’s debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due existing covenant restrictions may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing to avoid covenant defaults we may be required to repay debt obligations andor make additional contributions to tech all of which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

we expect to make future acquisitions and alliances which involve numerous risks 

acquisitions and the formation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and any future transactions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

new product development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop dram nand flash and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture new products that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will recover costs of development efforts 

the future success of our imaging foundry business is dependent on aptina’s market success and customer demand 

in recent quarters aptina’s net sales and gross margins decreased due to declining demand and increased competition there can be no assurance that aptina will be able to grow or maintain its market share or gross margins any reduction in aptina’s market share could adversely affect the operating results of our imaging foundry business aptina’s success depends on a number of factors including 

 

 

 

 

depressed pricing for semiconductor memory products may lead to future losses and inventory writedowns 

as a result of the significant decreases in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products we recorded charges of 603 million in aggregate for 2009 282 million in aggregate for 2008 and 20 million in 2007 to write down inventories to their estimated market value differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated market value of our semiconductor memory inventory by approximately 75 million at september 3 2009 if the estimated market values of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarterend date are below the manufacturing cost of these products we will recognize charges to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of our inventories to market value 

the inability to reach an acceptable agreement with our tech joint venture partners regarding the future of tech after its shareholders’ agreement expires in april 2011 could have a significant adverse effect on our dram production and results of operation 

since 1998 we have participated in tech a semiconductor memory manufacturing joint venture in singapore among the company canon inc “canon” and hewlettpackard company “hp” as of september 3 2009 the ownership of tech was held approximately 85 by us approximately 11 by canon and approximately 4 by hp the financial results of tech are included in our consolidated financial statements in 2009 tech accounted for 20 of our total dram gigabit production the shareholders’ agreement for tech expires in april 2011 in the first quarter of 2010 tech received a notice from hp that it does not intend to extend the tech joint venture beyond april 2011 we are working with hp and canon to reach a resolution of the matter the parties’ inability to reach a resolution of this matter prior to april 2011 could result in the dissolution of tech and have a significant adverse impact on our dram production and results of operation 

products that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses if despite design review quality control and product qualification procedures problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

 

 

  

  

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap and are reported in us dollars across our multinational operations there are transactions and balances denominated in other currencies primarily the singapore dollar euro and yen we recorded net losses from changes in currency exchange rates of 30 million for 2009 and of 25 million for 2008 we estimate that based on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as of september 3 2009 a 1 change in the exchange rate versus the us dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately us 3 million for the singapore dollar and 1 million for the euro and yen in the event that the us dollar weakens significantly compared to the singapore dollar euro and yen our results of operations or financial condition will be adversely affected 

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

sales to customers outside the united states approximated 81 of our consolidated net sales for 2009 in addition we have manufacturing operations in china italy japan puerto rico and singapore our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited 

we have a valuation allowance against substantially all of our us net deferred tax assets as of september 3 2009 we had aggregate us tax net operating loss carryforwards of 42 billion and unused us tax credit carryforwards of 212 million we also had unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of 26 billion and unused state tax credits of 198 million substantially all of the net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2022 to 2029 and substantially all of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2013 to 2029 utilization of these net operating losses and credit carryforwards is dependent upon us achieving sustained profitability as a consequence of prior business acquisitions utilization of the tax benefits for some of the tax carryforwards is subject to limitations imposed by section 382 of the internal revenue code and some portion or all of these carryforwards may not be available to offset any future taxable income the determination of the limitations is complex and requires significant judgment and analysis of past transactions 

  

  

if our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs additionally our control over operations at our im flash tech inotera and mp mask joint ventures may be limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced minor disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment and equipment failures if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

disruptions in our supply of raw materials could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected

results of operations 

 

the company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53week period ending on the thursday closest to august 31 

net sales 

total net sales for 2009 decreased 18 as compared to 2008 primarily due to a 17 decrease in memory sales and a 21 decrease in imaging sales memory sales for 2009 reflect significant declines in per gigabit average selling prices partially offset by significant increases in gigabits sold as compared to 2008 memory sales were 89 of total net sales for 2009 and 2008 and 88 for 2007 the 21 decrease in imaging sales for 2009 was primarily due to lower sales volume and average sales prices total net sales for 2008 increased 3 as compared to 2007 primarily due to a 4 increase in memory sales partially offset by a 5 decrease in imaging sales 

  

  

in response to adverse market conditions the company shut down production of nand for im flash at the company’s boise fabrication facility beginning in the second quarter of 2009 and phased out the remainder of its 200mm dram production at the boise fabrication facility in the second half of 2009 in addition the company implemented production slowdowns at some of its manufacturing facilities during 2009 production of memory and imaging products in 2009 was affected by the shutdown of the boise fabrication facility and slowdowns at other facilities the company will adjust utilization of 200mm wafer processing capacity as product demand varies 

the company has formed partnering arrangements under which it has sold andor licensed technology to other parties the company’s memory segment recognized royalty and license revenue of 135 million in 2009 and 58 million in 2008 

memory memory sales for 2009 decreased 17 from 2008 primarily due to a 23 decrease in sales of dram products and a 10 decrease in sales of nand flash products 

sales of dram products for 2009 decreased from 2008 primarily due to a 52 decline in average selling prices mitigated by a 56 increase in gigabits sold gigabit production of dram products increased 52 for 2009 despite the shutdown of the boise fabrication facility and production slowdowns at other 200mm wafer fabrication facilities the dram production increase was primarily due to production efficiencies achieved primarily through transitions to higher density advanced geometry devices in the fourth quarter of 2009 the company began receiving trench dram products from inotera the company expects that in 2010 its dram production will increase as a result of increases in stack and trench dram production purchased from inotera sales of ddr2 and ddr3 dram the company’s highest volume products were 29 of the company’s total net sales for 2009 and 2008 and were 32 for 2007 

the company sells nand flash products in three principal channels 1 to intel corporation “intel” through its im flash consolidated joint venture at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost 2 to original equipment manufacturers “oem’s” and other resellers and 3 to retail customers aggregate sales of nand flash products for 2009 decreased 10 from 2008 and represented 39 of the company’s total net sales for 2009 as compared to 35 for 2008 and 23 for 2007 

sales through im flash to intel were 886 million for 2009 1037 million for 2008 and 497 million for 2007 for 2009 average selling prices for im flash sales to intel decreased significantly due to a 61 reduction in costs per gigabit however gigabit sales to intel were 110 higher in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to an 85 increase in gigabit production of nand flash products over the same period as a result of the company’s continued transition to higher density 34 nanometer nm nand flash products and other improvements in product and process technologies the increase in nand flash production was achieved despite the shutdown of 200mm nand flash production which began in the second quarter of 2009 the company expects that its gigabit production of nand flash products will continue to increase in 2010 but at a slower rate than in 2009 

aggregate sales of nand flash products to the company’s oem resellers and retail customers were 4 lower for 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due a 52 decline in average selling prices partially offset by a 100 increase in gigabit sales average selling prices to the company’s oem and reseller customers for 2009 decreased approximately 41 compared to 2008 while average selling prices of the company’s lexar brand directed primarily at the retail market decreased approximately 62 for 2009 compared to 2008 

memory sales for 2008 increased 4 from 2007 primarily due to a 55 increase in sales of nand flash products offset by a 15 decrease in sales of dram products sales of nand flash products for 2008 increased from 2007 primarily due to an increase of approximately 370 in gigabits sold as a result of production increases partially offset by a decline of 67 in average selling prices per gigabit gigabit production of nand flash products increased approximately 350 for 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to the continued ramp of nand flash products at the company’s 300mm fabrication facilities and transitions to higher density advanced geometry devices sales of dram products for 2008 decreased from 2007 primarily due to a decline of 51 in average selling prices which included the effects of a 50 million charge to revenue in the first quarter of 2007 as a result of a settlement agreement with a class of direct purchasers of certain dram products mitigated by an increase in gigabits sold of approximately 70 gigabit production of dram products increased approximately 70 for 2008 primarily due to production efficiencies from improvements in product and process technologies including tech’s conversion to 300mm wafer fabrication 

  

  

imaging imaging sales for 2009 decreased by 21 from 2008 primarily due to decreased unit sales and declines in average selling prices demand for imaging products in 2009 was adversely impacted by weakness in the mobile phone markets imaging sales for 2009 were also negatively impacted by the company’s sale of a 65 interest in aptina on july 10 2009 after the sale of the company’s 65 interest in aptina imaging’s revenue is derived entirely from sales of imaging wafers to aptina under a wafer supply agreement the company anticipates that pricing under the wafer supply agreement will generally result in lower revenue than historically realized on sales by the company of imaging products to end customers imaging sales for 2008 decreased 5 from 2007 primarily due to significant declines in average selling prices by product type partially offset by a shift in product mix from products with 1megapixel or lower resolution to products with 3megapixel or higher resolution which had higher average selling prices per unit imaging sales were 11 of the company’s total net sales for 2009 and 2008 and 12 for 2007 

gross margin 

the company’s overall gross margin percentage declined from negative 1 for 2008 to negative 9 for 2009 due to declines in the gross margins for both memory and imaging primarily as a result of severe pricing pressure mitigated by cost reductions the company’s overall gross margin percentage declined from 19 for 2007 to negative 1 for 2008 primarily due to a decrease in the gross margin percentage for memory as a result of significant declines in average selling prices production slowdowns implemented at some of the company’s 200mm manufacturing facilities during 2009 adversely affected per gigabit costs of memory products and per unit costs of imaging products 

memory the company’s gross margin percentage for memory products declined from negative 5 for 2008 to negative 12 for 2009 primarily due to declines in the gross margin for dram products partially offset by improvements in the gross margin for nand flash products gross margins for 2009 were positively affected by significant cost reductions for dram and nand flash products and the effects of selling memory products that were subject to inventory writedowns in 2008 as discussed in more detail below gross margins for memory products in 2009 were adversely affected by 187 million of costs associated with underutilized capacity primarily from inotera and im flash’s singapore facility the company expects that underutilized capacity costs from inotera will decrease substantially in 2010 as inotera increases its utilization of production capacity 

the company’s gross margins for memory in 2009 2008 and 2007 were impacted by charges to write down inventories to their estimated market values as a result of the significant decreases in average selling prices for both dram and nand flash products as charges to write down inventories are recorded in advance of when inventories are sold gross margins in subsequent reporting periods are higher than they otherwise would be the impact of inventory writedowns on gross margins for all periods reflects inventory writedowns less the estimated net effect of prior period writedowns the effects of inventory writedowns on gross margin by period were as follows 

 

in future periods the company will be required to record additional inventory writedowns if estimated average selling prices of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarterend date are below the manufacturing cost of those products 

declines in gross margins on sales of dram products for 2009 as compared to 2008 were primarily due to the 52 decline in average selling prices mitigated by 40 reduction in costs per gigabit the reduction in dram costs per gigabit was primarily due to production efficiencies achieved through transitions to higherdensity advancedgeometry devices dram production costs for 2009 were adversely impacted by 95 million of underutilized capacity costs from inotera 

the company’s gross margin on sales of nand flash products for 2009 improved from 2008 despite a 56 decrease in overall average selling prices per gigabit primarily due to a 61 reduction in costs per gigabit the reduction in nand flash costs per gigabit was primarily due to lower manufacturing costs as a result of increased production of higherdensity advancedgeometry devices in particular from the company’s transition to 34nm process technology gross margins on sales of nand flash products reflect sales of approximately half of im flash’s output to intel at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost 

the company’s gross margin percentage for memory products declined from 17 for 2007 to negative 5 for 2008 primarily due to the significant decreases in average selling prices writedowns of inventories to their estimated market values and the shift in product mix to nand flash products which had a significantly lower gross margin than dram products in 2008 mitigated by cost reductions the company’s gross margin for dram products for 2008 declined from 2007 primarily due to the 51 decline in average selling prices per gigabit mitigated by a 38 reduction in costs per gigabit cost reductions in 2008 for dram products were partially offset by inventory writedowns the company’s gross margin for nand flash products for 2008 declined from 2007 primarily due to the 67 decline in average selling prices per gigabit mitigated by a 64 reduction in costs per gigabit cost reductions in 2008 primarily reflect lower manufacturing costs and lower costs of nand flash products purchased for sale under the company’s lexar brand nand flash costs for 2008 were also reduced by a recovery of 70 million for price adjustments for nand flash products purchased from other suppliers in prior periods cost reductions in 2008 for nand flash products were partially offset by inventory writedowns 

imaging the company’s gross margin percentage for imaging declined from 28 for 2008 to 16 for 2009 primarily due to declines in average selling prices and costs associated with underutilized production capacity the decrease in the gross margin percentage for 2009 was mitigated by a shift in product mix to products with 3megapixels or more which realized higher margins imaging gross margins subsequent to the company’s sale of a 65 interest in aptina on july 10 2009 are affected by the transition to a wafer foundry manufacturing model where imaging sells all of its output to aptina under a wafer supply agreement the company anticipates that pricing under the wafer supply agreement will generally result in lower gross margins than historically realized by the company on sales of imaging products to end customers the company’s gross margin for imaging declined to 28 for 2008 from 34 for 2007 primarily due to declines in average selling prices mitigated by cost reductions and a shift to higher resolution products that realized better gross margins 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for 2009 decreased 22 from 2008 primarily due to lower payroll expenses and other costs related to the company’s restructure initiatives and lower legal expenses lower payroll expenses reflect reductions in headcount variable pay salary levels and employee benefits sga expenses for 2008 decreased 25 from 2007 primarily due to lower legal costs as well as lower payroll costs and other expenses driven by the company’s restructure initiatives the reduction of payroll costs in 2008 was primarily the result of a decrease in employee headcount in 2007 the company recorded a 31 million charge to sga as a result of the settlement of certain antitrust class action direct purchaser lawsuits future sga expense is expected to vary potentially significantly depending on among other things the number of legal matters that are resolved relatively early in their lifecycle and the number of matters that progress to trial sga expenses by segment were as follows 

 

research and development 

research and development “rd” expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture its products the company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification as costs incurred in production prior to qualification are charged to rd 

rd expenses for 2009 decreased 5 from 2008 primarily due to lower payroll costs and decreases in costs of development wafers processed lower payroll expenses reflect reductions in variable pay salary levels and employee benefits rd expenses were reduced by 107 million in 2009 148 million in 2008 and 240 million in 2007 for amounts reimbursable from intel under a nand flash rd costsharing arrangement rd expenses for 2008 decreased 16 from 2007 primarily due to decreases in development wafers processed and lower payroll costs driven by the company’s restructure initiatives the company expects that the sale of a majority interest in aptina in the fourth quarter of 2009 will reduce rd expenses in future periods rd expenses by segment were as follows 

  

  

 

the company’s process technology research and development “rd” efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate the company’s transition to next generation memory products additional process technology rd efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures the investigation of new opportunities that leverage the company’s core semiconductor expertise and the development of new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts are concentrated on the company’s high density ddr3 and mobile products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including mlc technology specialty memory products and memory systems 

restructure 

in response to a severe downturn in the semiconductor memory industry and global economic conditions the company initiated restructure plans in 2009 primarily within the company’s memory segment in the first quarter of 2009 im flash a joint venture between the company and intel terminated its agreement with the company to obtain nand flash memory supply from the company’s boise facility reducing the company’s nand flash production by approximately 35000 200mm wafers per month in connection with the termination of the nand flash memory supply agreement intel paid the company 208 million in 2009 the company and intel also agreed to suspend tooling and the ramp of nand flash production at im flash’s singapore wafer fabrication facility in addition the company phased out all remaining 200mm dram wafer manufacturing operations in boise idaho in the second half of 2009 as a result of these restructure plans the company reduced employment in 2009 by approximately 4600 employees or approximately 20 due to improvements in market conditions and the pursuit of new business opportunities future reduction in employees may not occur in 2008 and 2007 to reduce costs the company implemented restructure initiatives including workforce reductions and relocating and outsourcing certain of its operations the following table summarizes restructure charges credits resulting from the company’s restructure activities 

 

goodwill impairment 

in the second quarter of 2009 the company’s imaging segment experienced a severe decline in sales margins and profitability due to a significant decline in demand for products as a result of the downturn in global economic conditions the drop in market demand resulted in significant declines in average selling prices and unit sales due to these market and economic conditions the company’s imaging segment and its competitors experienced significant declines in market value as a result the company concluded that there were sufficient factual circumstances for interim impairment analyses under sfas no 142 and it performed an assessment of goodwill for impairment based on the results of the impairment analysis the company wrote off all 58 million of goodwill relating to its imaging segment in the second quarter of 2009 

in the first and second quarters of 2008 the company experienced a sustained significant decline in its stock price as a result of the decline in stock price the company’s market capitalization fell significantly below the recorded value of its consolidated net assets for most of the second quarter of 2008 the reduced market capitalization reflected in part the memory segment’s lower average selling prices and expected continued weakness in pricing for the company’s memory products due to these market and economic conditions the company concluded that there were sufficient factual circumstances for interim impairment analyses of its memory segment under sfas no 142 and it performed an assessment of goodwill for impairment based on the results of the impairment analysis the company wrote off all 463 million of goodwill relating to its memory segment in the second quarter of 2008

income taxes 

income taxes for 2009 2008 and 2007 primarily reflect taxes on the company’s nonus operations and us alternative minimum tax the company has a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax asset associated with its us operations the benefit for taxes on us operations in 2009 2008 and 2007 was substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowance as of september 3 2009 the company had aggregate us tax net operating loss carryforwards of 42 billion and unused us tax credit carryforwards of 212 million the company also had unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of 26 billion and unused state tax credits of 198 million as of september 3 2009 substantially all of the net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2022 to 2029 and substantially all of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2013 to 2029 due to the expiration of certain foreign statutes of limitations the company recognized approximately 15 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in 2008 

equity in net losses of equity method investees 

in connection with its dram partnering arrangements with nanya the company has investments in two taiwan dram memory companies accounted for as equity method investments inotera and meiya inotera and meiya each have fiscal years that end on december 31 the company recognizes its share of inotera’s and meiya’s quarterly earnings or losses for the calendar quarter that ends within the company’s fiscal quarter this results in the recognition of the company’s share of earnings or losses from these entities for a period that lags the company’s fiscal periods by two months the company recognized losses from these equity method investments of 140 million for 2009 

as a result of its sale of a 65 interest in its aptina subsidiary on july 10 2009 the company’s investment in aptina is accounted for as an equity method investment the company’s shares in aptina constitute 35 of aptina’s total common and preferred stock and 64 of aptina’s common stock under the equity method the company recognizes its share of aptina’s results of operations based on its 64 share of aptina’s common stock on a twomonth lag beginning in 2010 

see “item 8 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – supplemental balance sheet information – equity method investments” 

noncontrolling interests in net income loss

stockbased compensation 

total compensation cost for the company’s equity plans in 2009 2008 and 2007 was 44 million 48 million and 44 million respectively stock compensation expenses fluctuate based on assessments of whether performance conditions will be achieved for the company’s performancebased stock grants as of september 3 2009 71 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards was expected to be recognized through the fourth quarter of 2013 

liquidity and capital resources

the company’s liquidity is highly dependent on average selling prices for its products and the timing of capital expenditures both of which can vary significantly from period to period depending on conditions in the semiconductor memory market the company’s cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash and investments may not be adequate to meet the company’s needs for capital expenditures and operations historically the company has used external sources of financing to fund these needs due to conditions in the credit markets it may be difficult to obtain financing on terms acceptable to the company the company significantly reduced its actual capital expenditures for 2009 and planned capital expenditures for 2010 in addition the company is considering further financing alternatives continuing to limit capital expenditures and implementing further cost reduction initiatives 

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 1206 million in 2009 which reflected approximately 642 million generated from the production and sales of the company’s products and approximately 564 million provided from the management of working capital specifically the company reduced the amount of working capital as of september 3 2009 invested in inventories by 304 million and receivables by 126 million as compared to august 28 2008 

investing activities net cash used for investing activities was 674 million in 2009 which included cash expenditures of 488 million for property plant and equipment and cash expenditures of 408 million for the acquisition of a 355 interest in inotera partially offset by the net effect of maturities and purchases of marketable investment securities of 124 million a significant portion of the capital expenditures related to im flash and tech operations the company believes that to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality it must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and capital equipment and research and development the company expects that capital spending will be approximately 750 million to 850 million for 2010 as of september 3 2009 the company had commitments of approximately 276 million for the acquisition of property plant and equipment most of which is expected to be paid within one year 

financing activities net cash used for financing activities was 290 million in 2009 which primarily reflects 705 million of distributions to joint venture partners 429 million in debt payments and 144 million in payments on equipment purchase contracts partially offset by 716 million in proceeds from borrowings and 276 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock 

on april 15 2009 the company issued 693 million shares of common stock for 415 per share in a registered public offering the company received net proceeds of 276 million after deducting underwriting fees and other offering costs of 12 million 

on april 15 2009 the company issued 230 million of 425 convertible senior notes due october 15 2013 the “425 senior notes” issuance costs associated with the 425 senior notes totaled 7 million the initial conversion rate for the 425 senior notes is 1967052 shares of common stock per 1000 principal amount of the 425 senior notes this is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 508 per share of common stock holders of the 425 senior notes may convert their 425 senior notes at any time prior to maturity unless previously redeemed or repurchased the company may not redeem the 425 senior notes prior to april 20 2012 on or after april 20 2012 the company may redeem for cash all or part of the 425 senior notes if the closing price of its common stock has been at least 135 of the conversion price for at least 20 trading days during a 30 consecutive trading day period 

concurrent with the offering of the 425 senior notes the company also entered into capped call transactions the “2009 capped calls” that have an initial strike price of approximately 508 per share subject to certain adjustments which was set to equal the initial conversion price of the 425 senior notes the 2009 capped calls have a cap price of 664 per share and cover an approximate combined total of 452 million shares of common stock and are subject to standard adjustments for instruments of this type the 2009 capped calls are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the 425 senior notes if however the market value per share of the common stock as measured under the terms of the 2009 capped calls exceeds the applicable cap price of the 2009 capped calls there would be dilution to the extent that the then market value per share of the common stock exceeds the cap price the 2009 capped calls expire in october and november of 2012 the company paid approximately 25 million to purchase the 2009 capped calls 

on february 23 2009 the company entered into a singapore dollardenominated term loan agreement with the singapore economic development board “edb” enabling the company to borrow up to 300 million singapore dollars at 54 per annum the terms of the agreement require the company to use the proceeds from any borrowings under the agreement to make equity contributions to its tech company’s joint venture subsidiary the loan agreement further required that tech use the proceeds from the company’s equity contributions to purchase production assets and meet certain production milestones related to the implementation of advanced process manufacturing the loan contains a covenant that limits the amount of indebtedness tech can incur without approval from the edb the loan is collateralized by the company’s shares in tech up to a maximum of 66 of tech’s outstanding shares the company drew 150 million singapore dollars in the second quarter of 2009 and an additional 150 million singapore dollar in the third quarter of 2009 the aggregate 300 million singapore dollars outstanding 208 million us dollars as of september 3 2009 is due in february 2012 with interest payable quarterly

joint ventures in 2009 im flash distributed 695 million to intel and the company expects that it will make additional distributions to intel in 2010 timing of these distributions and any future contributions however is subject to market conditions and approval of the partners 

the company purchased 99 million of tech shares on february 27 2009 99 million of tech shares on june 2 2009 and 60 million of tech shares on august 27 2009 as a result the company’s ownership interest in tech increased from approximately 73 as of august 28 2008 to approximately 85 in august 2009 the company expects to make additional capital contributions to tech in 2010 to support its continued transition to 50nm wafer processing the timing and amount of these contributions is subject to market conditions 

  

  

contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations at september 3 2009 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the company’s liquidity and cash flows in future periods 

 

the obligations disclosed above do not include contractual obligations recorded on the company’s balance sheet as current liabilities except for the current portion of longterm debt the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services market prices or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria 1 they are noncancelable 2 the company would incur a penalty if the agreement was cancelled or 3 the company must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take delivery of the contracted products or services “takeorpay” if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable the entire value of the contract was included in the above table if the obligation is cancelable but the company would incur a penalty if cancelled the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation contracted minimum amounts specified in takeorpay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment 

pursuant to the inotera supply agreement the company has an obligation to purchase up to 50 of inotera’s output of semiconductor memory components subject to specific terms and conditions as purchase quantities are based on qualified production output the inotera supply agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity and therefore the company did not include its obligations under the inotera supply agreement in the contractual obligations table above the company’s obligation under the inotera supply agreement also fluctuates due to pricing which is based on manufacturing costs and margins associated with the resale of dram products pursuant to the company’s obligations under the inotera supply agreement the company purchased 46 million of trench dram products from inotera in 2009 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

concurrent with the offering of the 1875 senior notes in may 2007 the company paid approximately 151 million for three capped call transactions the “capped calls” the capped calls cover an aggregate of approximately 913 million shares of common stock the capped calls are in three equal tranches with cap prices of 1725 2013 and 2300 per share respectively each with an initial strike price of approximately 1423 per share subject to certain adjustments the capped calls expire on various dates between november 2011 and december 2012 the capped calls are intended to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of the senior notes 

concurrent with the offering of the 425 senior notes in april 2009 the company paid approximately 25 million for three capped call instruments that have an initial strike price of approximately 508 per share the “2009 capped calls” the 2009 capped calls have a cap price of 664 per share and cover an aggregate of approximately 452 million shares of common stock the capped calls expire in october and november of 2012 the 2009 capped calls are intended to reduce potential dilution upon conversion of the 425 senior notes

recently adopted accounting standards 

in february 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities – including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” under sfas no 159 an entity may elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis subject to certain restrictions the company adopted sfas no 159 effective as of the beginning of 2009 the company did not elect to measure any existing items at fair value upon the adoption of sfas no 159 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 as amended by subsequent fsp’s defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the company adopted sfas no 157 effective as of the beginning of 2009 for financial assets and financial liabilities the adoption did not have a significant impact on the company’s financial statements sfas no 157 is also effective for all other assets and liabilities of the company as of the beginning of 2010 the company does not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on its financial statements as of the adoption date the impact to periods subsequent to the initial adoption of sfas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities will depend on the nature and extent of nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value after the beginning of 2010 

recently issued accounting standards 

in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 167 “amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r” “sfas no 167” which 1 replaces the quantitativebased risks and rewards calculation for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity with an approach that is primarily qualitative 2 requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and 3 requires additional disclosures about an enterprise’s involvement in variable interest entities  the company is required to adopt sfas no 167 as of the beginning of 2011 the company is evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas no 167 will have on its financial statements 

in may 2008 the fasb issued fsp no apb 141 “accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement” fsp no apb 141 requires that issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion separately account for the liability and equity components of such instruments in a manner such that interest cost will be recognized at the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate in subsequent periods the company is required to adopt fsp no apb 141 as of the beginning of 2010 upon adoption the company will retrospectively account for its 13 billion of 1875 convertible senior notes issued in may 2007 under the provisions of fsp no apb 141 at issuance the carrying value of the 13 billion convertible senior notes will be 402 million lower under fsp no apb 141 this difference of 402 million will be recognized in equity as additional capital and the carrying value of the convertible senior notes will be accreted to their face amount with a charge to interest expense over the approximate sevenyear term of the notes resulting in additional interest expense net of the effects of capitalized interest of 50 million 38 million and 12 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively additional interest expense will be 53 million in 2010 57 million in 2011 62 million in 2012 67 million in 2013 and 54 million in 2014 under fsp no apb 141 the carrying value of the 13 billion convertible senior notes will be 1006 million at september 3 2009 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations ” “sfas no 141r” which establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination 1 recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree 2 recognizes and measures goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and 3 determines what information to disclose sfas no 141r is effective for the company as of the beginning of 2010 the impact of the adoption of sfas no 141r will depend on the nature and extent of business combinations occurring after the beginning of 2010 

  

  

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements – an amendment of arb no 51” sfas no 160 requires that 1 noncontrolling interests be reported as a separate component of equity 2 net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be separately identified in the statement of operations 3 changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest be accounted for as equity transactions and 4 any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary be initially measured at fair value sfas no 160 is effective for the company as of the beginning of 2010 and must be applied prospectively except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which must be applied retrospectively as a result of the retrospective adoption the company’s reported total equity for 2009 and 2008 will increase by 1986 million and 2865 million respectively and its net loss for the years 2009 2008 and 2007 will increase decrease by 111 million 10 million and 122 million respectively the effect in periods subsequent to the initial adoption will depend on the amounts and balances of noncontrolling interests as of and for those periods and the nature and extent of transactions involving changes in the company’s noncontrolling interests after the beginning of 2010 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and requires management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

acquisitions and consolidations determination and the allocation of the purchase price of acquired operations significantly influences the period in which costs are recognized accounting for acquisitions and consolidations requires the company to estimate the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired as well as various forms of consideration given which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized the company typically obtains independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values determining whether or not to consolidate a variable interest entity may require judgment in assessing whether the company is the entity’s primary beneficiary 

contingencies the company is subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 

goodwill and intangible assets the company tests goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred such as a significant adverse change in the business climate including declines in selling prices for products or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit goodwill is tested for impairment using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires valuation of all of the company’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then the company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

  

  

determining when to test for impairment the company’s reporting units the fair value of a reporting unit and the fair value of assets and liabilities within a reporting unit requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables the company bases fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates in addition judgments and assumptions are required to allocate assets and liabilities to reporting units in the second quarter of 2009 the company wrote off all 58 million of its goodwill related to the imaging segment based on the results of its test for impairment in the second quarter of 2008 the company wrote off all 463 million of its goodwill relating to its memory segment based on the results of its test for impairment 

the company tests other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives and subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset the company tests intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows estimating fair values involves significant assumptions especially regarding future sales prices sales volumes costs and discount rates 

income taxes the company is required to estimate its provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year the company is also required to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of the company’s performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the company’s ability to generate future taxable income 

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value and the company recorded charges of 603 million in aggregate for 2009 and 282 million in aggregate for 2008 to write down the carrying value of inventories of memory products to their estimated market values cost includes labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes the company reviews recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analysis of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated market values below the company’s manufacturing costs the company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated market value of the company’s semiconductor memory inventory by approximately 75 million at september 3 2009 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories the company’s inventories have been categorized as memory products or imaging products the major characteristics the company considers in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 

product and process technology costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by the company are capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over periods currently ranging up to 10 years the company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents filed capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of i the estimated useful life of the technology ii the patent term or iii the term of the technology agreement 

  

  

property plant and equipment the company reviews the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by the company including but not limited to future use of the assets for company operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for the company’s products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required by the company in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

research and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development as incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by the company the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability subsequent to product qualification product costs are valued in inventory 

stockbased compensation under the provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fairvalue of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award for stockbased compensation awards with graded vesting that were granted after 2005 the company recognizes compensation expense using the straightline amortization method for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved the company utilizes forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgment 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates the company develops its estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation the company uses the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards the company estimates stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on the company’s stock

overview 

the company is a global manufacturer and marketer of semiconductor devices principally dram and nand flash memory and cmos image sensors the company’s products are offered in a wide variety of package and configuration options architectures and performance characteristics tailored to meet application and customer needs individual devices take advantage of the company’s advanced semiconductor processing technology and manufacturing expertise the company aims to continually introduce new generations of products that offer lower costs per unit and improved performance characteristics the company operates in two segments memory and imaging see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – segment information” 

in 2008 and 2007 the semiconductor memory industry experienced a severe downturn due to a significant oversupply of products average selling prices per gigabit for the company’s dram products and nand flash products in 2008 were down approximately 50 and 65 respectively as compared to 2007 and down approximately 65 and 85 respectively as compared to 2006 as a result of these market conditions the company and other semiconductor memory manufacturers have reported negative gross margins and substantial losses in recent periods in 2008 the company reported a net loss of 16 billion and many of its competitors reported negative cash flows from operations in response to these market conditions on october 9 2008 the company announced a plan to restructure its memory operations the company’s im flash joint venture with intel corporation “intel” will discontinue its production of 200mm wafer nand flash memory products at micron’s boise facility the nand flash production shutdown will reduce im flash’s nand flash production by approximately 35000 200mm wafers per month in addition the company and intel agreed to suspend tooling and the ramp of nand flash production at im flash’s singapore wafer fabrication plant as part of this restructuring the company plans to reduce its global workforce by approximately 15 percent during 2009 and 2010 cash costs for restructuring and other related expenses 

 

incurred in connection with this restructuring are anticipated to be approximately 60 million and the benefit to the company’s cash operating results for 2009 is expected to exceed 175 million 

the effects of the worsening global economy and the tightening credit market are also making it increasingly difficult for semiconductor memory manufacturers to obtain external sources of financing to fund their operations although the company believes that it is better positioned than some of its peers it faces challenges in the current and near term that require it to continue to make significant improvements in its competitiveness the company is pursuing financing alternatives delaying capital expenditures and implementing further costcutting initiatives 

memory the memory segment’s primary products are dram and nand flash which are key components used in a broad array of electronic applications including personal computers workstations network servers mobile phones flash memory cards usb storage devices mp34 players and other consumer electronics products the company sells primarily to original equipment manufacturers distributors and retailers located around the world 

the company is focused on improving its memory segment’s competitiveness by developing new products advancing its technology and reducing costs in addition the company increased its manufacturing capacity in 2008 and 2007 by ramping nand flash production at two 300mm wafer fabrication facilities and converting another facility to 300mm dram wafer fabrication 

in the third quarter of 2008 the company and nanya technology corporation “nanya” formed meiya a joint venture to manufacture stack dram products and sell those products exclusively to the company and nanya as part of this transaction the company transferred and licensed certain intellectual property to nanya and licensed certain intellectual property from nanya the company and nanya also agreed to jointly develop process technology and designs to manufacture stack dram products with each party bearing its own development costs until such time that the development costs exceed a specified amount following which such costs would be shared the company’s development costs are expected to exceed nanya’s development costs by a significant amount   under this arrangement the company is to receive an aggregate of 232 million from nanya and meiya through   2010   for licensing and technology transfer fees of which the company realized 40 million of revenue in 2008 the company will also receive royalties from nanya on the sale of stack dram products manufactured by or for nanya 

on october 12 2008 the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire qimonda ag’s 356 ownership stake in inotera memories inc “inotera” a taiwanese dram memory manufacturer for 400 million in cash the company received commitments for 285 million of term loans to fund this acquisition in part inotera is expected to implement the company’s stack dram process technology and it is anticipated that the company will receive royalties on inotera’s production that is delivered to nanya a 356 stakeholder in inotera the company will eventually gain access to approximately 60000 300mm dram wafers per month 50 of inotera’s output in connection with this acquisition the company expects to enter into a series of agreements with nanya to restructure meiya it is anticipated that both parties will cease future resource commitments to meiya and redirect those resources to inotera see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – joint ventures – dram joint ventures with nanya technology corporation” 

imaging the company’s imaging segment operates under the aptina brand name imaging’s primary products are cmos image sensors which are key components used in a broad array of electronic applications including mobile phones digital still cameras webcams and other consumer security and automotive applications the company’s primary customers are camera module integrators located around the world the company is exploring partnering arrangements with outside parties regarding the separation of its aptina imaging business to an independent entity in which the company would retain a significant minority ownership interest to that end the company began operating its imaging business as a separate whollyowned subsidiary in october 2008 under the arrangements being considered the company expects that it will continue to manufacture cmos image sensors for some period of time

manufacturing 

the company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china italy japan puerto rico and singapore the company’s manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment most semiconductor equipment must be replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment 

the company’s process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment the company is continuously enhancing its production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in 2008 the company manufactured most of its dram products using its 78nm and 68nm linewidth process technology and began transferring its dram production to 58nm linewidth process technology the company expects to continue to transfer more of its dram production to 58nm linewidth process technology in 2009 in 2008 the company manufactured most of its nand flash memory products using its 50nm linewidth process technology and began transferring its nand production to 34nm linewidth process technology the company expects that in 2009 the majority of its nand flash memory products will be manufactured using its 34nm linewidth process technology in 2008 and 2007 the company significantly increased its 300mm wafer production as im flash ramped production at two 300mm wafer fabrication facilities and the company’s tech joint venture converted its dram production to 300mm wafers 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls dust particles equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks and circuit design marginalities or defects can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional success of the company’s manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard the company employs rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes the company is able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

after fabrication silicon wafers are separated into individual die the company sells semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie “bare die” forms for packaged products functional die are sorted connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages the company assembles products in a variety of packages including tsop thin small outline package tqfp thin quad flat package and fbga fine pitch ball grid array bare die products address customer requirements for smaller form factors and higher memory densities and provide superior flexibility bare die products are used in packaging technologies such as systemsinapackage sips and multichip packages mcps which reduce the board area required 

the company tests its products at various stages in the manufacturing process performs high temperature burnin on finished products and conducts numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition the company uses its proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of dram die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

the company assembles a significant portion of its memory products into memory modules memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards “pcbs” that insert directly into computer systems or other electronic devices the company’s lexar subsidiary contracts with an independent foundry and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices 

the company is pursuing alternatives to reduce its assembly test and module assembly costs including relocation of current operations to lower cost locations and outsourcing these alternatives could affect the company’s manufacturing processes in future periods 

in recent years the company has produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances the company’s ability to allocate resources to its most profitable products but increases the complexity of its manufacturing process although new product lines such as nand flash cmos image sensors and specialty memory can be manufactured using processes that are very similar to the processes for the company’s predominant dram products frequent conversions to new products and the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts can affect the company’s cost efficiency 

  

  

nand flash joint ventures with intel corporation the company has formed two joint ventures with intel to manufacture nand flash memory products for the exclusive benefit of the partners im flash technologies llc and im flash singapore llp collectively “im flash” im flash manufactures nand flash memory products pursuant to nand flash designs developed by the company and intel and licensed to the company the parties share the output of im flash generally in proportion to their investment in im flash the company owned a 51 interest in im flash at august 28 2008 im flash’s financial results are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company

availability of raw materials 

the company’s production processes require raw materials that meet exacting standards including several that are customized for or unique to the company the company generally has multiple sources and sufficient availability of supply however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet the company’s standards various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases lead frames molding compound and other materials in addition any transportation problems could delay the company’s receipt of raw materials although raw materials shortages or transportation problems have not interrupted the company’s operations in the past shortages may occur from time to time in the future also lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if the company’s supply of raw materials is interrupted or lead times are extended results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

  

marketing and customers 

the company’s products are sold into computing consumer networking telecommunications and imaging markets approximately 50 of the company’s net sales for 2008 were to the computing market including desktop pcs servers notebooks and workstations sales to intel primarily for nand flash from the im flash joint ventures were 19 of the company’s net sales in 2008 sales to hewlettpackard company were 10 of the company’s net sales in 2007 

the company’s memory products are offered under the micron lexar spectek and crucial brand names and private labels the company’s imaging products are offered under the aptina brand name the company markets its semiconductor products primarily through its own direct sales force and maintains sales offices in its primary markets around the world the company maintains inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of product shipments the company’s lexar subsidiary sells nand flash memory products through retail and oem channels the company’s crucial technology division sells memory products through a webbased customer direct sales channel the company’s products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by the company and are compensated on a commission basis the company makes shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry the company’s products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors’ products 

the company offers products designed to meet the diverse needs of computing server automotive networking security commercialindustrial consumer electronics medical and mobile applications many of the company’s customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several months as the company further diversifies its product lines and reduces the die sizes of existing products more products become subject to qualification which may delay volume introduction of specific devices by the company 

backlog 

because of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for the company’s semiconductor products fluctuate significantly orders are typically accepted with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment customers can change delivery schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty for these reasons the company does not believe that its order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

product warranty 

because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that the company may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice the company generally provides a limited warranty that its products are in compliance with company specifications existing at the time of delivery under the company’s general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances the company may provide more extensive limited warranty coverage and general legal principles may impose more extensive liability than that provided under the company’s general terms and conditions 

competition 

the company faces intense competition in the semiconductor memory markets from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc qimonda ag samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation toshiba corporation and emerging companies in taiwan and china some of the company’s competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which the company competes invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities the company’s competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs these factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices 

  

  

the company faces competition in the image sensor market from a number of suppliers of cmos image sensors including omnivision technologies inc samsung electronics co ltd sony corporation stmicroelectronics nv toshiba corporation and from a number of suppliers of ccd image sensors including matsushita electric industrial co ltd sharp corporation and sony corporation in recent periods a number of new companies have entered the cmos image sensor market competitors include many large domestic and international companies that may have greater presence in key markets better access to certain customer bases greater name recognition and more established strategic and financial relationships than the company 

research and development 

the company’s process technology research and development “rd” efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate the company’s transition to next generation memory products and cmos image sensors additional process technology rd efforts focus on advanced computing and mobile memory architectures and new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts are concentrated on the company’s 1 gb and 2 gb ddr2 and ddr3 products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including mlc technology specialty memory products memory systems and cmos image sensors the company’s rd expenses were 680 million 805 million and 656 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

to compete in the semiconductor memory industry the company must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes the company believes that expansion of its semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory and imaging solutions the company has several product design centers around the world the largest located at its corporate headquarters in boise idaho in addition the company develops leading edge photolithography mask technology at its mp mask joint venture facility in boise 

rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture its products the company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification the company and intel share rd process and design costs for nand flash equally the company and nanya also jointly develop process technology and designs to manufacture stack dram products with each party bearing its own development costs until such time that the development costs exceed a specified amount following which such costs would be shared the company’s development costs are expected to exceed nanya’s development costs by a significant amount product development costs are recorded as rd expense

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company 

we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business 

for 2008 average selling prices of dram products and nand flash products decreased approximately 50 and 65 respectively as compared to 2007 for 2007 average selling prices of dram products and nand flash products decreased 23 and 56 respectively as compared to 2006 in other recent years we also have experienced significant annual decreases in per gigabit average selling prices for our memory products including 34 in 2006 24 in 2005 17 in 2003 53 in 2002 and 60 in 2001 at times average selling prices for our memory products have been below our costs we recorded inventory writedowns of 282 million in 2008 and 20 million in 2007 as a result of significant decreases in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products if the estimated market values of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date are below the manufacturing cost of these products we recognize charges to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of our inventories to market value future charges for inventory writedowns could be significantly larger than the amount recorded in 2008 and 2007 if average selling prices for our memory products remain depressed or decrease faster than we can decrease per gigabit costs as they recently have our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology facilities and capital equipment research and development and product and process technology we currently estimate our capital spending to approximate between 10 billion to 13 billion for 2009 cash and investments of im flash and tech are generally not available to finance our other operations in the past we have utilized external sources of financing and access to capital markets has historically been very important to us as a result of the severe downturn in the semiconductor memory market the downturn in general economic conditions and the adverse conditions in the credit markets financing instruments that we have used in the past are currently not available to us and may not be available to us for extended periods there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows or find other sources of financing to fund our operations make adequate capital investments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency or access capital markets our inability to do the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at the rate average selling prices decline 

our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per gigabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes including reducing the die size of our existing products in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per gigabit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to increase gross margins due to factors including but not limited to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes changes in process technologies or products that inherently may require relatively larger die sizes per gigabit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of certain specialty memory products 

the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc qimonda ag samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation toshiba corporation and from emerging companies in taiwan and china who have significantly expanded the scale of their operations some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities 

  

  

our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs the transitions to smaller linewidth process technologies and 300mm wafers in the industry have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and will likely lead to future increases increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production we and several of our competitors have significantly increased production in recent periods through construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our nand flash memory operations involve numerous risks 

as a result of severe oversupply in the nand flash market our average selling prices of nand flash products for 2008 decreased approximately 65 as compared to 2007 after decreasing 56 for 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result we experienced negative gross margins on sales of our nand flash products in 2008 in october 2008 we announced that our im flash joint venture with intel corporation will discontinue production of 200mm wafer nand flash memory at micron’s boise facility the nand flash production shutdown will reduce im flash’s nand flash production by approximately 35000 200mm wafers per month in addition we and intel agreed to suspend tooling and the ramp of production nand flash at im flash’s singapore wafer fabrication plant a continuation of the challenging conditions in the nand flash market will materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

our joint ventures and strategic partnerships involve numerous risks 

we have entered into partnering arrangements to manufacture products and develop new manufacturing process technologies and products these arrangements include our im flash nand flash joint ventures with intel our dram joint ventures with nanya our tech dram joint venture and our mp mask joint venture with photronics these strategic partnerships and joint ventures are subject to various risks that could adversely affect the value of our investments and our results of operations these risks include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if our joint ventures and strategic partnerships are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 

economic conditions may harm our business 

economic and business conditions including a continuing downturn in the semiconductor memory industry or the overall economy could adversely affect our business adverse conditions may affect consumer demand for devices that incorporate our products such as mobile phones personal computers flash memory cards and usb devices reduced demand for our products could result in market oversupply and significant decreases in our selling prices a continuation of conditions in credit markets would limit our ability to obtain external financing to fund our operations and capital expenditures in addition we may experience losses on our holdings of cash and investments due to failures of financial institutions and other parties difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivables due to credit defaults as a result our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

  

we may incur additional restructure charges or not realize the expected benefits of new initiatives to reduce costs across our operations 

on october 9 2008 we announced a plan to restructure our memory operations including im flash’s shutdown of 200mm wafer nand flash memory production at our boise facility the nand flash production shutdown will reduce im flash’s nand flash production by approximately 35000 200mm wafers per month in addition we and intel agreed to suspend tooling and the ramp of production at im flash’s singapore wafer fabrication plant as part of this restructuring we plan to reduce our global workforce by approximately 15 percent during 2009 and 2010 cash costs for restructuring and other related expenses incurred in connection with this restructuring are anticipated to be approximately 60 million and the benefit to our cash operating results for 2009 is expected to exceed 175 million we may incur additional restructure costs or not realize the expected benefits of these new initiatives as a result of these initiatives we expect to lose production output incur restructuring or other infrequent charges and we may experience disruptions in our operations loss of key personnel and difficulties in delivering products timely 

our acquisition of a 356 interest in inotera memories inc involves numerous risks 

on october 12 2008 we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire qimonda ag’s 356 ownership stake in inotera memories inc a taiwanese dram memory manufacturer for 400 million in cash we received commitments of 285 million of term loans to fund this acquisition in part inotera is expected to implement the company’s stack process technology we expect to eventually gain access to approximately 60000 300mm dram wafers per month 50 of inotera’s output our acquisition of an interest in inotera involves numerous risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as a result of these risks we may be unable to complete the inotera acquisition or achieve our objectives for the acquisition which may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

an adverse result in our litigation matters could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

on january 13 2006 rambus inc “rambus” filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california rambus alleges that certain of our ddr2 ddr3 rldram and rldram ii products infringe as many as eighteen rambus patents and seeks monetary damages treble damages and injunctive relief the accused products account for a significant portion of our net sales on june 2 2006 we filed an answer and counterclaim against rambus alleging among other things antitrust and fraud claims trial on the patent phase of that case is currently scheduled to begin january 19 2009 

  

  

on may 5 2004 rambus filed a lawsuit in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county against us and other dram suppliers the complaint alleges various causes of action under california state law including conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices on rambus dram rdram and unfair competition the complaint seeks treble damages punitive damages attorneys’ fees costs and a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint trial is currently scheduled to begin in march 2009 see “item 3 legal proceedings” for additional details on these cases and other rambus matters pending in europe and delaware 

we are unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits the adverse resolution of these lawsuits could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we are engaged in patent litigation with mosaid technologies inc mosaid in the us district court for the northern district of california mosaid alleges that certain of our dram and cmos image sensor products infringe up to twelve mosaid patents and seeks monetary damages treble damages and injunctive relief the accused products account for a significant portion of our net sales trial is currently scheduled for june 5 2009 see “item 3 legal proceedings” for additional details 

we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

allegations of anticompetitive conduct

three purported class action lawsuits alleging pricefixing of flash products have been filed in canada asserting violations of the canadian competition act these cases assert claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that purchased flash memory directly and indirectly from various flash memory suppliers see “item 3 legal proceedings” for additional details on these cases and related matters 

we are unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits an adverse court determination in any of these lawsuits alleging violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

allegations of violations of securities laws 

on february 24 2006 a number of purported class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our officers in the us district court for the district of idaho alleging claims under section 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and rule 10b5 promulgated thereunder the cases purport to be brought on behalf of a class of purchasers of our stock during the period february 24 2001 to february 13 2003 the five lawsuits have been consolidated and a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed on july 24 2006 the complaint generally alleges violations of federal securities laws based on among other things claimed misstatements or omissions regarding alleged illegal pricefixing conduct the complaint seeks unspecified damages interest attorneys fees costs and expenses on december 19 2007 the court issued an order certifying the class but reducing the class period to purchasers of our stock during the period from february 24 2001 to september 18 2002 see “item 3 legal proceedings” for additional details on these cases and related matters 

we are unable to predict the outcome of these cases an adverse court determination in any of the class action lawsuits against us could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

covenants in our debt instruments may obligate us to repay debt increase contributions to our tech joint venture and limit our ability to obtain financing 

our ability to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in our debt may be affected by economic or business conditions or other events as of august 28 2008 the company had notes payable of 108 million denominated in japanese yen that were subject to covenants including the ratio of debt to equity as a result of financing that we are pursuing for our acquisition of a 356 interest in inotera we may prepay all of this yendenominated debt in the first quarter of 2009 to avoid defaulting on these covenants in addition as of august 28 2008 our 73 owned tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd “tech” subsidiary had 600 million outstanding under a credit facility with covenants that among other requirements establish certain liquidity debt service coverage and leverage ratios for tech and restrict tech’s ability to incur indebtedness create liens and acquire or dispose of assets if tech does not comply with these debt covenants and restrictions this debt may be deemed to be in default and the debt declared payable additionally if tech is unable to repay its borrowings when due the lenders under tech’s credit facility could proceed against substantially all of tech’s assets we have guaranteed approximately 73 of the outstanding amount of tech’s credit facility and our obligation increases to 100 of the outstanding amount of the facility upon the occurrence of certain conditions if tech’s debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due existing covenant restrictions may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing and to avoid covenant defaults we may have to pay off debt obligations and make additional contributions to tech which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 

products that fail to meet specifications are defective or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses if despite design review quality control and product qualification procedures problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

  

  

 

 

our debt level is higher than compared to historical periods 

we currently have a higher level of debt compared to historical periods as of august 28 2008 we had 27 billion of debt and we will incur an additional 285 million of debt in connection with our acquisition of a 356 interest in inotera we may need to incur additional debt in the future our debt level could have a negative impact on us for example it could 

 

 

 

 

 

 

new product development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop nand flash imaging and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture these new products that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will recover costs of development efforts 

the future success of our imaging business will be dependent on continued market acceptance of our products and the development introduction and marketing of new imaging products 

we face competition in the image sensor market from a number of suppliers of cmos image sensors including omnivision technologies inc samsung electronics co ltd sony corporation stmicroelectronics nv toshiba corporation and from a number of suppliers of ccd image sensors including matsushita electric industrial co ltd sharp corporation and sony corporation in recent periods a number of new companies have entered the cmos image sensor market competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have greater presence in key markets better access to certain customer bases greater name recognition and more established strategic and financial relationships than the company 

in recent years our imaging net sales and gross margins decreased and we faced increased competition there can be no assurance that we will be able to grow or maintain our market share or gross margins for imaging products in the future the success of our imaging business will depend on a number of factors including 

 

 

  

  

 

 

 

our efforts to restructure our imaging business may be unsuccessful 

we are exploring partnering arrangements with outside parties regarding the separation of our aptina imaging business to an independent entity in which we would retain a significant minority ownership interest to that end we began operating our imaging business as a separate whollyowned subsidiary in october 2008 to the extent we form a partnering arrangement the resulting business model may not be successful and the imaging operations revenues and margins could be adversely affected we may incur significant costs to convert imaging operations to a new business structure and operations could be disrupted in addition we may lose key personnel if our efforts to restructure the imaging business are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we expect to make future acquisitions and alliances which involve numerous risks 

acquisitions and the formation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and any future transactions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited 

we have significant net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we have provided significant valuation allowances against the tax benefit of such losses as well as certain tax credit carryforwards utilization of these net operating losses and credit carryforwards is dependent upon us achieving sustained profitability as a consequence of prior business acquisitions utilization of the tax benefits for some of the tax carryforwards is subject to limitations imposed by section 382 of the internal revenue code and some portion or all of these carryforwards may not be available to offset any future taxable income the determination of the limitations is complex and requires significant judgment and analysis of past transactions 

  

  

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap and are reported in us dollars across our multinational operations there are transactions and balances denominated in other currencies primarily the euro yen and singapore dollar we recorded a net loss of 25 million from changes in currency exchange rates for 2008 we estimate that based on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as of august 28 2008 a 1 change in the exchange rate versus the us dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately us 1 million for the euro and yen in the event that the us dollar weakens significantly compared to the euro yen or singapore dollar our results of operations or financial condition will be adversely affected 

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

sales to customers outside the united states approximated 75 of our consolidated net sales for 2008 in addition we have manufacturing operations in china italy japan puerto rico and singapore our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per gigabit manufacturing costs additionally our control over operations at our im flash tech inotera meiya and mp mask joint ventures may be limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced minor disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages improperly functioning equipment and equipment failures if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

disruptions in our supply of raw materials could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases lead frames and molding compound 

  

  

shortages may occur from time to time in the future in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected

overview 

the company is a global manufacturer of semiconductor devices principally semiconductor memory products including dram and nand flash and cmos image sensors the company operates in two segments memory and imaging its products are used in a broad range of electronic applications including personal computers workstations network servers mobile phones and other consumer applications including flash memory cards usb storage devices digital still cameras mp34 players and in automotive applications the company markets its products through its internal sales force independent sales representatives and distributors primarily to original equipment manufacturers and retailers located around the world the company’s success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of a diversified portfolio of semiconductor memory products efficient utilization of the company’s manufacturing infrastructure successful ongoing development of advanced process technologies and generation of sufficient return on research and development investments 

in 2008 and 2007 the semiconductor memory industry experienced a severe downturn due to a significant oversupply of products average selling prices per gigabit for the company’s dram products and nand flash products in 2008 were down approximately 50 and 65 respectively as compared to 2007 and down approximately 65 and 85 respectively as compared to 2006 as a result of these market conditions the company and other semiconductor memory manufacturers have reported negative gross margins and substantial losses in recent periods in 2008 the company reported a net loss 16 billion and many of its competitors reported negative cash flows from operations in response to these market conditions on october 9 2008 the company announced a plan to restructure its memory operations the company’s im flash joint venture with intel corporation will discontinue production of 200mm wafer nand flash memory at micron’s boise facility the nand flash production shutdown will reduce im flash’s nand flash production by approximately 35000 200mm wafers per month in addition the company and intel agreed to suspend tooling and the ramp of nand flash production at im flash’s singapore wafer fabrication plant as part of the restructuring the company plans to reduce its global workforce by approximately 15 percent during 2009 and 2010 cash costs for restructuring and other related expenses incurred in connection with this restructuring are anticipated to be approximately 60 million and the benefit to the company’s cash operating results for 2009 is expected to exceed 175 million 

the effects of the worsening global economy and the tightening credit market are also making it increasingly difficult for semiconductor memory manufacturers to obtain external sources of financing to fund their operations although the company believes that it is better positioned than some of its peers it faces challenges in the current and near term that require it to continue to make significant improvements in its competitiveness additionally the company is pursuing financing alternatives delaying capital expenditures and implementing further costcutting initiatives 

the company is focused on improving its competitiveness by developing new products advancing its technology and reducing costs in addition the company increased its manufacturing capacity in 2008 and 2007 by ramping nand flash production at two 300mm wafer fabrication facilities and converting another facility to 300mm dram wafer fabrication to reduce costs the company implemented restructure initiatives aimed at reducing manufacturing and overhead costs through outsourcing relocation of operations and workforce reductions 

  

  

the company makes significant ongoing investments to develop proprietary product and process technology that is implemented in its worldwide manufacturing facilities and through its joint ventures to enable the production of semiconductor products with increasing functionality and performance at lower costs the company generally reduces the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technology such as its leadingedge line width process technology and innovative array architecture the company continues to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics such as higher data transfer rates reduced package size lower power consumption and increased memory density and megapixel count to leverage its significant investments in research and development the company has formed strategic joint ventures under which the costs of developing memory product and process technologies are shared with its joint venture partners in addition from time to time the company has also sold andor licensed technology to third parties the company is pursuing further opportunities to recover its investment in intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements 

dram joint ventures with nanya technology corporation “nanya” in the third quarter of 2008 the company and nanya formed meiya a joint venture to manufacture stack dram and sell those products exclusively to the company and nanya as part of this transaction the company transferred and licensed certain intellectual property related to the manufacture of stack dram products to nanya and licensed certain intellectual property from nanya the company and nanya also agreed to jointly develop process technology and designs to manufacture stack dram products with each party bearing its own development costs until such time that the development costs exceed a specified amount following which such costs would be shared the company’s development costs are expected to exceed nanya’s development costs by a significant amount under this arrangement the company is to receive an aggregate of 232 million from nanya and meiya through 2010 for licensing and technology transfer fees of which the company realized 40 million of revenue in 2008 the company will also receive royalties from nanya on the sale of stack dram products manufactured by or for nanya 

on october 12 2008 the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire qimonda ag’s 356 ownership stake in inotera memories inc “inotera” a taiwanese dram memory manufacturer for 400 million in cash the company received commitments for 285 million of term loans to fund this acquisition in part inotera is expected to implement the company’s stack dram process technology and it is anticipated that the company will receive royalties on the sale of inotera’s production that is delivered to nanya a 356 stakeholder in inotera the company will eventually gain access to approximately 60000 300mm dram wafers per month 50 of inotera’s output in connection with this acquisition the company expects to enter into a series of agreements with nanya to restructure meiya it is anticipated that both parties will cease future resource commitments to meiya and redirect those resources to inotera see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – joint ventures – dram joint ventures with nanya technology corporation” 

aptina imaging business the company is exploring partnering arrangements with outside parties regarding the separation of its cmos image sensor business operating under the name “aptina” to an independent entity in which the company would retain a significant minority ownership interest to that end the company began operating its imaging business as a separate whollyowned subsidiary in october 2008 under the arrangements being considered the company expects that it will continue to manufacture cmos image sensors for some period of time 

goodwill impairment in the second quarter of 2008 the company recorded a noncash impairment charge of 463 million to the goodwill recorded in its memory segment see “item 8 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – supplemental balance sheet information – goodwill” 

inventory writedowns   the company’s results of operations for the fourth second and first quarters of 2008 and the fourth quarter of 2007 included charges of 205 million 15 million 62 million and 20 million respectively to write down the carrying value of work in process and finished goods inventories of memory products both dram and nand flash to their estimated market values

total net sales for 2008 increased 3 as compared to 2007 primarily due to a 4 increase in memory sales partially offset by a 5 decrease in imaging sales memory sales for 2008 reflect significant increases in gigabits sold partially offset by significant declines in per gigabit average selling prices as compared to 2007 memory sales were 89 of total net sales for 2008 88 for 2007 and 86 for 2006 imaging sales for 2008 decreased 5 from 2007 primarily reflecting pricing pressure total net sales for 2007 increased 8 as compared to 2006 primarily due to an 11 increase in memory sales partially offset by an 8 decline in imaging sales 

memory memory sales for 2008 increased 4 from 2007 primarily due to a 55 increase in sales of nand flash products offset by a 15 decrease in sales of dram products 

sales of nand flash products for 2008 increased from 2007 primarily due to an increase of approximately 370 in gigabits sold as a result of production increases partially offset by a decline of approximately 65 in average selling prices per gigabit gigabit production of nand flash products increased approximately 350 for 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to the continued ramp of nand flash products at the company’s 300mm fabrication facilities and transitions to higher density advanced geometry devices sales of nand flash products represented approximately 35 of the company’s total net sales for 2008 as compared to approximately 25 for 2007 and approximately 5 for 2006 the company expects that its gigabit production of nand flash products will continue to increase in 2009 but at a slower rate than 2008 

sales of dram products for 2008 decreased from 2007 primarily due to a decline of approximately 50 in average selling prices which included the effects of a 50 million charge to revenue in the first quarter of 2007 as a result of a settlement agreement with a class of direct purchasers of certain dram products mitigated by an increase in gigabits sold of approximately 70 gigabit production of dram products increased approximately 70 for 2008 primarily due to production efficiencies from improvements in product and process technologies including tech’s conversion to 300mm wafer fabrication sales of ddr2 and ddr3 dram the company’s highest volume products were approximately 30 of the company’s total net sales for 2008 and 2007 and approximately 25 for 2006 

  

  

memory sales for 2007 increased 11 from 2006 primarily due to a 287 increase in sales of nand flash products offset by an 11 decrease in sales of dram products sales of nand flash products for 2007 increased from 2006 primarily due to significant increases in gigabit production and the company’s acquisition of lexar media inc which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2006 partially offset by a 56 decline in average selling prices per gigabit gigabit production of nand flash products increased over 800 for 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to the ramp of nand flash products at the company’s 300mm fabrication facilities and transitions to higher density advanced geometry devices sales of dram products for 2007 decreased from 2006 primarily due to a 23 decline in average selling prices which included the effects of a 50 million charge to revenue in the first quarter of 2007 as a result of a settlement agreement with a class of direct purchasers of certain dram products which was partially mitigated by a 16 increase in gigabits sold gigabit production of dram products increased 23 for 2007 primarily due to transitions to higher density advanced geometry devices 

imaging imaging sales for 2008 decreased 5 from 2007 primarily due to significant declines in average selling prices by product type partially offset by a shift in product mix from products with 1megapixel or lower resolution to products with 3megapixel or higher resolution which had higher average selling prices per unit imaging sales were 11 of the company’s total net sales in 2008 as compared to 12 for 2007 and 14 for 2006 imaging sales for 2007 decreased 8 from 2006 primarily due to declines in average selling prices as a result of industry softness in mobile handset sales and pricing pressure declines in average selling prices for 2007 were mitigated by increased sales of higher resolution products 

gross margin 

the company’s overall gross margin percentage declined from 19 for 2007 to negative 1 for 2008 primarily due to a decrease in the gross margin percentage for memory as a result of the significant declines in per gigabit average selling prices the company’s overall gross margin percentage for 2007 declined to 19 from 23 for 2006 due to a decrease in both the gross margin percentages for memory and imaging products 

memory the company’s gross margin percentage for memory products declined from 17 for 2007 to negative 5 for 2008 primarily due to the significant decreases in average selling prices and the shift in product mix to nand flash products which had a significantly lower gross margin than dram products in 2008 mitigated by cost reductions 

the company’s gross margins for memory in 2008 were reduced by a 205 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 to writedown inventories to their estimated market values as a result of the significant decreases in average selling prices for both dram and nand flash products the company’s inventory writedowns of 15 million and 62 million in the second and first quarters of 2008 respectively did not significantly impact 2008 gross margins as a substantial portion of the writtendown inventory was sold in 2008 gross margins for 2007 were reduced by a 20 million inventory writedown in the fourth quarter of 2007 in future periods the company would record additional inventory writedowns if estimated average selling prices of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarterend date are below the manufacturing cost of these products 

the company’s gross margin for dram products for 2008 declined from 2007 primarily due to the decrease in average selling prices per gigabit of approximately 50 mitigated by a reduction in costs per gigabit the company achieved cost reductions for dram products through transitions to higherdensity advancedgeometry devices cost reductions in 2008 for dram products were partially offset by the inventory writedowns excluding the inventory writedowns the company reduced its dram costs per gigabit by approximately 35 for 2008 as compared to 2007 

the company’s gross margin for nand flash products for 2008 declined from 2007 primarily due to the decrease in average selling prices per gigabit of approximately 65 mitigated by a reduction in costs per gigabit cost reductions in 2008 primarily reflect lower manufacturing costs and lower costs of nand flash products purchased for sale under the company’s lexar brand the company achieved manufacturing cost reductions for nand flash products primarily through increased production of higherdensity advancedgeometry devices at the company’s 300mm fabrication facilities nand flash costs for 2008 were also reduced by a recovery of 70 million for price adjustments for nand flash products purchased from other suppliers in prior periods cost reductions in 2008 for nand flash products were partially offset by the inventory writedowns excluding the inventory writedowns and the effect of pricing adjustments from other suppliers the company reduced its nand flash costs per gigabit by approximately 65 sales of nand flash products include sales from im flash to intel at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost im flash sales to intel were 1037 million 497 million and 114 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

  

the company’s gross margin percentage for memory products of 17 for 2007 declined from 19 for 2006 primarily due to the shift in product mix from dram products to nand flash products which had a significantly lower gross margin than dram products in 2007 this decline in gross margin percentage was mitigated by improvements in the gross margin for 2007 on sales of both dram and nand flash products as compared to 2006 the gross margin for dram products for 2007 improved from 2006 primarily due to a reduction in costs per gigabit of approximately 25 partially offset by a decline in average selling prices of approximately 25 the company achieved cost reductions for dram products through transitions to production of devices utilizing the company’s 78nm process technologies the company’s gross margin for nand flash products for 2007 improved slightly from 2006 primarily due to a reduction in costs per gigabit of approximately 55 partially offset by a decline in average selling prices of approximately 55 cost reductions in 2007 reflect lower manufacturing costs lower costs of nand flash products purchased for sale under the company’s lexar brand and shifts in product mix the company achieved manufacturing cost reductions for nand flash products primarily through increased production of higherdensity advancedgeometry devices at the company’s 300mm fabrication facilities 

in 2008 the company’s tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd “tech” joint venture accounted for approximately 12 of the company’s total wafer production tech primarily produced ddr and ddr2 products in 2008 2007 and 2006 since tech utilizes the company’s product designs and process technology and has a similar manufacturing cost structure the gross margin on sales of tech products approximates gross margins on sales of similar products manufactured by the company’s whollyowned operations see “item 8 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – joint ventures – tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd” 

imaging the company’s gross margin for imaging declined to 28 for 2008 from 34 for 2007 primarily due to declines in average selling prices mitigated by cost reductions and a shift to higher resolution products which realized better gross margins the company’s gross margin for imaging declined to 34 for 2007 from 43 for of 2006 primarily due to declines in average selling prices that were mitigated by cost reductions and shifts in product mix to higher resolution products 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for 2008 decreased 25 from 2007 primarily due to lower legal costs as well as lower payroll costs and other expenses driven by the company’s restructure initiatives the reduction of payroll costs in 2008 was primarily the result of a decrease in headcount in 2007 the company recorded a 31 million charge to sga as a result of the settlement of certain antitrust class action direct purchaser lawsuits sga expenses for 2007 increased 33 from 2006 primarily due to higher personnel costs and higher legal costs including the 31 million charge for settlement of the direct purchaser lawsuits personnel costs in 2007 increased from 2006 primarily due to increased headcount resulting from the acquisition of lexar in the fourth quarter of 2006 the formation of im flash in the second quarter of 2006 and subsequent ramp of its operations and the consolidation of tech in the third quarter of 2006 future sga expense is expected to vary potentially significantly depending on among other things the number of legal matters that are resolved relatively early in their lifecycle and the number of matters that progress to trial for the company’s memory segment sga expenses as a percentage of sales were 7 in 2008 11 in 2007 and 8 in 2006 for the imaging segment sga expenses as a percentage of sales were 11 in 2008 11 in 2007 and 12 in 2006 

research and development 

research and development “rd” expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture its products the company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification as costs incurred in production prior to qualification are charged to rd 

rd expenses for 2008 decreased 16 from 2007 primarily due to decreases in development wafers processed and lower payroll costs driven by the company’s restructure initiatives rd expenses for 2007 increased 23 from 2006 primarily due to nand preproduction wafer processing mitigated by reimbursements received from intel under a nand flash rd costsharing arrangement rd expenses were reduced by 148 million in 2008 240 million in 2007 and 86 million in 2006 for amounts reimbursable from intel under the nand flash rd costsharing arrangement for the memory segment rd expenses as a percentage of sales were 10 for 2008 13 for 2007 and 13 for 2006 for the imaging segment rd expenses as a percentage of sales were 22 for 2008 23 for 2007 and 11 for 2006 

  

  

the company’s process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate the company’s transition to nextgeneration memory products and cmos image sensors additional process technology rd efforts focus on advanced computing and mobile memory architectures and new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts are concentrated on the company’s 1 gb and 2 gb ddr2 and ddr3 products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including mlc technology specialty memory products memory systems and cmos image sensors 

goodwill impairment 

in the second quarter of 2008 the company performed an assessment of impairment for goodwill in the first and second quarters of 2008 the company experienced a sustained significant decline in its stock price as a result of the decline in stock price the company’s market capitalization fell significantly below the recorded value of its consolidated net assets for most of the second quarter of 2008 the reduced market capitalization reflected in part the memory segment’s lower average selling prices and expected continued weakness in pricing for the company’s memory products 

based on the results of the company’s assessment of goodwill for impairment it was determined that the carrying value of the memory segment exceeded its estimated fair value therefore the company performed the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of goodwill specifically the company allocated the estimated fair value of the memory segment as determined in the first step to recognized and unrecognized net assets including allocations to intangible assets such as intellectual property customer relationships and brand and trade names the result of the analysis indicated that there would be no remaining implied value attributable to goodwill in the memory segment and accordingly the company wrote off all 463 million of goodwill associated with its memory segment as of february 28 2008 the company’s assessment of goodwill for impairment in the second and fourth quarters of 2008 indicated that the fair value of the imaging segment exceeded its carrying value and therefore goodwill in the segment was not impaired see “item 8 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – supplemental balance sheet information – goodwill” 

restructure 

in an effort to increase its competitiveness and efficiency in the fourth quarter of 2007 the company began pursuing a number of initiatives to reduce costs across its operations these initiatives included workforce reductions in certain areas of the company as its business was realigned additional initiatives included establishing certain operations closer in location to the company’s global customers and evaluating functions more efficiently performed through partnerships or other outside relationships in 2008 the company recorded charges of 33 million primarily within its memory segment for employee severance and related costs relocation and retention bonuses and a writedown of certain facilities to their fair values since the restructure initiatives were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2007 the company has incurred 52 million of restructure costs 

on october 9 2008 the company announced a plan to restructure its memory operations the company’s im flash joint venture with intel corporation will discontinue production of 200mm wafer nand flash memory at micron’s boise facility the nand flash production shutdown will reduce im flash’s nand flash production by approximately 35000 200mm wafers per month in addition the company and intel agreed to suspend tooling and the ramp of production at im flash’s singapore wafer fabrication plant as part of the restructuring the company plans to reduce its global workforce by approximately 15 percent during 2009 and 2010 cash costs for restructuring and other related expenses incurred in connection with this restructuring are anticipated to be approximately 60 million and the benefit to the company’s cash operating results for 2009 is expected to exceed 175 million 

other operating income expense net 

other operating income for 2008 included gains of 66 million for disposals of semiconductor equipment and 38 million for receipts from the us government in connection with antidumping tariffs other operating expenses for 2008 included losses of 25 million from changes in currency exchange rates other operating income for 2007 included gains of 43 million from disposals of semiconductor equipment 30 million from the sale of certain intellectual property to toshiba corporation and 7 million in grants received in connection with the company’s operations in china other operating expense for 2007 included losses of 14 million from changes in currency exchange rates other operating income for 2006 included 230 million of net proceeds for the sale of the company’s existing nand flash memory designs and certain related technology to intel net of amounts paid by the company for a perpetual paidup license to use and modify such designs other operating income for 2006 also included 23 million in additional amounts expected to be reimbursed resulting from the extension of an economic development agreement which allows the company to recover amounts relating to certain investments in im flash 

  

  

income taxes 

income taxes for 2008 2007 and 2006 primarily reflect taxes on the company’s nonus operations and us alternative minimum tax the company has a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax asset associated with its us operations the benefit for taxes on us operations in 2008 2007 and 2006 was substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowance as of august 28 2008 the company had aggregate us tax net operating loss carryforwards of 27 billion and unused us tax credit carryforwards of 205 million the company also had unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of 18 billion and unused state tax credits of 189 million as of august 28 2008 substantially all of the net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2022 to 2028 and substantially all of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2013 to 2028 due to certain foreign statutes of limitations which expired on december 31 2007 the company recognized approximately 15 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in the second quarter of 2008 

noncontrolling interests in net income loss 

noncontrolling interests for 2008 2007 and 2006 primarily reflects the share of income or losses of the company’s tech joint venture attributable to the noncontrolling interests in tech on march 30 2007 the company acquired all of the shares of tech common stock held by the singapore economic development board which had the effect of reducing the noncontrolling interests in tech as of that date from 57 to 27 see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – joint ventures – tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd” 

stockbased compensation 

total compensation cost for the company’s equity plans in 2008 2007 and 2006 was 48 million 44 million and 26 million respectively as of august 28 2008 august 30 2007 and august 31 2006 3 million 3 million and 1 million of stockbased compensation expense was capitalized and remained in inventory as of august 28 2008 107 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards was expected to be recognized through the fourth quarter of 2012 in 2005 the company accelerated the vesting of substantially all of its unvested stock options then outstanding which reduced stock compensation recognized in subsequent periods 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of august 28 2008 the company had cash and equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 14 billion compared to 26 billion as of august 30 2007 the balance as of august 28 2008 included an aggregate of 508 million held at the company’s im flash and tech joint ventures the company’s ability to access funds held by joint ventures to finance the company’s other operations is subject to agreement by the joint venture partners 

the company’s liquidity is highly dependent on average selling prices for its products and the timing of capital expenditures both of which can vary significantly from period to period depending on conditions in the semiconductor memory market the company’s cash flows from operations and current holdings of cash and investments may not be adequate to meet the company’s current and longterm needs for capital expenditures and operations historically the company has used external financing to fund these needs due to conditions in the credit markets some financing instruments used by the company in the past are currently not available to the company as a result the company is pursuing financing alternatives delaying capital expenditures and implementing further costcutting initiatives the company has the ability and intent to significantly reduce capital expenditures and limit contributions to joint venture partners if necessary to meet its operating obligations 

operating activities the company generated 10 billion of cash from operating activities in 2008 which primarily reflects the company’s 16 billion of net loss adjusted by 21 billion for noncash depreciation and amortization expense and a 463 million noncash goodwill impairment charge 

  

  

investing activities net cash used by investing activities was 21 billion in 2008 which included cash expenditures for property plant and equipment of 25 billion partially offset by the net effect of purchases sales and maturities of marketable investment securities of 288 million and 187 million in proceeds from sales of equipment a significant portion of the capital expenditures relate to the ramp of im flash facilities and 300mm conversion of manufacturing operations at tech the company believes that to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality it must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and capital equipment and research and development the company expects 2009 capital spending to approximate 10 billion to 13 billion as of august 28 2008 the company had commitments of approximately 300 million for the acquisition of property plant and equipment nearly all of which are expected to be paid within one year 

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was 125 million in 2008 which primarily reflects 837 million in proceeds from borrowings and 268 million in cash contributions received net of distributions paid from joint venture partners partially offset by 698 million in debt payments and 387 million in payments on equipment purchase contracts

in may 2008 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb staff position “fsp” no apb 141 “accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement” fsp no apb 141 requires that issuers of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate as interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods the company is required to adopt fsp no apb 141 at the beginning of 2010 on adoption the company will retrospectively account for its 13 billion of 1875 convertible senior notes issued in may of 2007 under the provisions of fsp no apb 141 based on a preliminary analysis the company estimates that debt recognized on issuance of the 13 billion convertible senior notes would be approximately 400 million lower under fsp no apb 141 the difference of approximately 400 million would be accreted to interest expense over the approximate sevenyear term of the notes a significant portion of the interest expense would be deferred as capitalized interest costs in accordance with the company’s regular accounting policies and will impact results of operations as the assets 

 

that include the capitalized interest are depreciated the company is continuing to evaluate the full impact that the adoption of fsp no apb 141 will have on its financial statements 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations ” “sfas no 141r” which establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination 1 recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree 2 recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and 3 determines what information to disclose the company is required to adopt sfas no 141r effective at the beginning of 2010 the impact of the adoption of sfas no 141r will depend on the nature and extent of business combinations occurring on or after the beginning of 2010 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements – an amendment of arb no 51” sfas no 160 requires that 1 noncontrolling interests be reported as a separate component of equity 2 net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be separately identified in the income statement 3 changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest be accounted for as equity transactions and 4 any retained noncontrolling equity investment upon the deconsolidation of a subsidiary be initially measured at fair value the company is required to adopt sfas no 160 effective at the beginning of 2010 the company is evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 160 will have on its financial statements 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities – including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” under sfas no 159 the company may elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis subject to certain restrictions the company is required to adopt sfas no 159 effective at the beginning of 2009 the company did not elect to measure any existing items at fair value on the adoption of sfas no 159 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements in february 2008 the fasb issued fsp no fas 1571 “application of fasb statement no 157 to fasb statement no 13 and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement 13” which amends sfas no 157 to exclude accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under sfas no 13 in february 2008 the fasb issued fsp no fas 1572 “effective date of fasb statement no 157” which delays the effective date of sfas no 157 until the beginning of 2010 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually in october 2008 the fasb issued fsp no fas 1573 “determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active” which clarifies the application of sfas no 157 for financial assets in a market that is not active the company is required to adopt sfas no 157 for financial assets and liabilities effective at the beginning of 2009 the company does not expect that the adoption in 2009 of sfas no 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities will have a significant impact on its financial statements the company is evaluating the impact that the adoption in 2010 of sfas no 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities will have on its financial statements 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “fin 48” “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 contains a twostep approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 109 the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company adopted fin 48 on august 31 2007 the adoption of fin 48 did not have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations or financial position the company did not change its policy of recognizing accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax provision with the adoption of fin 48 see “item 8 financial statements – notes to consolidated financial statements – income taxes” 

in february 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 155 “accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments” sfas no 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation the company adopted sfas no 155 as of the beginning of 2008 the adoption of sfas no 155 did not have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

  

  

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and requires management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

acquisitions and consolidations determination and the allocation of the purchase price of acquired operations significantly influences the period in which costs are recognized accounting for acquisitions and consolidations requires the company to estimate the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired as well as various forms of consideration given which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized the company typically obtains independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values 

contingencies the company is subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 

goodwill and intangible assets in the second quarter of 2008 the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 463 million the company tests goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred such as a significant adverse change in the business climate including declines in selling prices for products or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit goodwill is tested for impairment using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the unit if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value then the second step of the impairment test must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires valuation of all of the company’s tangible and intangible asset and liabilities if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then the company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

determining when to test for impairment the company’s reporting units the fair value of a reporting unit and the fair value of assets and liabilities within a reporting unit requires judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables the company bases fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates in addition judgments and assumptions are required to allocate assets and liabilities to reporting units 

the company tests other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives and subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset the company tests intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows estimating fair values involves significant assumptions especially regarding future sales prices sales volumes costs and discount rates 

income taxes the company is required to estimate its provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year the company is also required to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of the company’s performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the company’s ability to generate future taxable income the company adopted fin 48 effective at the beginning of 2008 

  

  

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value and in 2008 the company recorded aggregate charges of 282 million to write down the carrying value of inventories of memory products to their estimated market values cost includes labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes the company reviews recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analysis of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated market values below the company’s manufacturing costs the company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated market value of the company’s semiconductor memory inventory by approximately 70 million at august 28 2008 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories the company’s inventories have been categorized as memory products or imaging products the major characteristics the company considers in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 

product and process technology costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by the company are capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over periods currently ranging up to 10 years the company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents filed capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of i the estimated useful life of the technology ii the patent term or iii the term of the technology agreement 

property plant and equipment the company reviews the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by the company including but not limited to future use of the assets for company operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for the company’s products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required by the company in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

research and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development when incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by the company the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability 

stockbased compensation under the provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fairvalue of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award for stock based compensation awards with graded vesting that were granted after 2005 the company recognizes compensation expense using the straightline amortization method for performancebased stock awards the expense recognized is dependent on the probability of the performance measure being achieved the company utilizes forecasts of future performance to assess these probabilities and this assessment requires considerable judgment 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates the company develops its estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation the company uses the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards the company estimates stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on the company’s stock 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

as of august 28 2008 2063 million of the company’s 2726 million of debt was at fixed interest rates as a result the fair value of the debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates the estimated fair market value of the company’s debt was 2167 million and 2411 million as of august 28 2008 and august 30 2007 respectively the company estimates that as of august 28 2008 a 1 decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixedrate debt by approximately 46 million an increase in interest rates of 1 would increase annual interest expense on the company’s variablerate debt as of august 28 2008 by approximately 7 million 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the information in this section should be read in conjunction with the information related to changes in the exchange rates of foreign currency in “item 1a risk factors” changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s operations is the us dollar the company held aggregate cash and other assets in foreign currencies valued at us 425 million as of august 28 2008 and us 448 million as of august 30 2007 the company also had aggregate foreign currency liabilities valued at us 580 million as of august 28 2008 and us 979 million as of august 30 2007 significant components of the company’s assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were as follows in us dollar equivalents 

 

the company estimates that based on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar as of august 28 2008 a 1 change in the exchange rate versus the us dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately us 1 million for the euro and the yen

imaging complementary metaloxide semiconductor “cmos” image sensors are the primary product of the company’s imaging segment cmos image sensors are semiconductor devices that capture and process images into pictures or video for a variety of consumer and industrial applications the company’s cmos image sensors are used in products such as cellular phone cameras digital still cameras pill cameras for medical use and in automotive and other emerging applications the company offers image sensors in a range of pixel resolutions from its vga video graphics array products to its higher resolution 8megapixel products the company manufactures a number of cmos image sensors featuring a leadingedge pixel size of 175 square microns that enable a smaller form factor product image sensors are sold either as individual components or combined with integrated circuitry to create complete camera systemonachip “soc” solutions 

the company’s cmos image sensors incorporating its digitalclarity™ technology offered many advantages over other cmos image sensors and chargecoupled device “ccd” sensors which enabled the company to maintain its leadership position the company’s digitalclarity™ technology features “active pixels” enabling better sensor performance that produces higherquality images at faster frame rates the company’s lowleakage dram processes are particularly wellsuited for the manufacture of cmos image sensors the company’s cmos image sensors consume substantially less power than ccd devices providing an advantage in batterydependent portable device applications where most image sensors are used by combining all camera functions on a single chip from the capture of photons to the output of digital bits cmos image sensors reduce the partcount of a digital camera system which in turn increases reliability eases miniaturization and enables onchip programming of frame size windowing exposure and other camera parameters the company’s cmos image sensors are also capable of producing highquality images in lowlight conditions in 2007 the company’s cmos image sensors’ activepixel design architecture enabled the company to achieve cmos imager performance that was comparable to highend ccd sensors 

sales of imaging products were 12 14 and 6 of the company’s total net sales in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the overall market for image sensors is expected to increase over the next several years due to the growth forecasted for applications such as phone cameras and digital still cameras and cmos image sensors are expected to capture an increasing percentage of the overall image sensor market 

manufacturing 

the company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the united states china italy japan puerto rico and singapore the company’s manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment most semiconductor equipment must be replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment 

the company’s process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment the company is continuously enhancing production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in 2007 the company manufactured most of its dram products using its 95 nanometer “nm” and 78nm linewidth process technology the company expects to continue to transfer more of its dram production to 78nm and 68nm linewidth process technology in 2008 in 2007 the company manufactured most of its nand flash memory products using its 72nm linewidth process technology and began transferring its nand production to 50nm linewidth process technology the company expects that in 2008 most of its nand flash memory products will be manufactured using its 50nm linewidth process technology 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls dust particles equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks and circuit design marginalities or defects can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional success of the company’s manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of highquality circuits in this regard the company employs rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes the company is able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

after fabrication silicon wafers are separated into individual die the company sells semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie “bare die” forms for packaged products functional die are sorted connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages the company assembles products in a variety of packages including tsop thin small outline package tqfp thin quad flat package and fbga fine pitch ball grid array bare die products address customer requirements for smaller form factors and higher memory densities and provide superior flexibility bare die products are used in packaging technologies such as systemsinapackage sips and multichip packages mcps which reduce the board area required 

the company tests its products at various stages in the manufacturing process performs high temperature burnin on finished products and conducts numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition the company uses its proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of dram die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

the company assembles a significant portion of its memory products into memory modules memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards “pcbs” that insert directly into computer systems or other electronic devices the company’s lexar subsidiary contracts with an independent foundry and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices 

the company is exploring alternatives to reduce its assembly test and module assembly costs including relocation of current operations to lower cost locations and outsourcing these alternatives could affect the company’s manufacturing processes in future periods 

in 2007 the company significantly increased its 300mm wafer production as im flash ramped production at two 300mm wafer fabrication facilities and the company’s tech joint venture began to convert its dram production to 300mm wafers the company expects that its 300mm wafer production in 2008 will continue to increase significantly at these facilities 

in recent years the company has produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances the company’s ability to allocate resources to its most profitable products but increases the complexity of the manufacturing process although new product lines such as nand flash cmos image sensors and specialty memory can be manufactured using processes that are very similar to the processes for the company’s predominant dram products frequent conversions to new products and the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts can affect the company’s cost efficiency 

nand flash joint ventures with intel corporation “im flash” the company has formed two joint ventures with intel to manufacture nand flash memory products for the exclusive benefit of the partners im flash technologies llc and im flash singapore llp collectively “im flash” im flash manufactures nand flash memory products pursuant to nand flash designs developed by the company and intel and licensed to the company the parties share the output of im flash generally in proportion to their investment in im flash the company owned a 51 interest in im flash at august 30 2007 im flash’s financial results are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company in 2007 im flash began construction of a new 300mm wafer fabrication facility in singapore which is expected to ramp in late 2009 see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – joint ventures – nand flash joint ventures with intel” 

tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd “tech” tech is a memory manufacturing joint venture in singapore among micron technology inc canon inc and hewlettpackard company the company owned an approximate 73 interest in tech at august 30 2007 tech’s semiconductor manufacturing facilities use the company’s product and process technology subject to specific terms and conditions the company has agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by tech tech supplied approximately 15 of the total megabits of memory produced by the company in 2007 reflecting approximately 40 of total dram megabits in 2007 tech began converting its manufacturing production from 200mm to 300mm wafers the conversion is expected to be completed in 2008 tech’s financial results were included in the consolidated financial statements of the company beginning in the third quarter of 2006 see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – joint ventures – tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd” 

mp mask technology center llc “mp mask” the company produces photomasks for leadingedge and advanced next generation semiconductors through mp mask a joint venture with photronics inc “photronics” the company and photronics have 5001 and 4999 interest respectively in mp mask the company and photronics also have supply arrangements wherein the company purchases a substantial majority of the reticles produced by mp mask the financial results of mp mask are included in the consolidated financial results of the company 

availability of raw materials 

the company’s production processes require raw materials that meet exacting standards including several that are customized for or unique to the company the company generally has multiple sources of supply however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet the company’s standards various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases lead frames molding compound and other materials in addition any transportation problems could delay the company’s receipt of raw materials although raw materials shortages or transportation problems have not interrupted the company’s operations in the past shortages may occur from time to time in the future also lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if the company’s supply of raw materials is interrupted or lead times are extended results of operations could be adversely affected 

marketing and customers 

the company’s products are sold into computing consumer networking telecommunications and imaging markets approximately 50 of the company’s net sales for 2007 were to the computing market including desktop pcs servers notebooks and workstations sales to hewlettpackard company were 10 of the company’s net sales in 2007 

the company’s products are offered under the micron lexar spectek and crucial brand names and private labels the company markets its semiconductor products primarily through its own direct sales force and maintains sales offices in its primary markets around the world the company maintains inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of product shipments the company’s lexar subsidiary sells nand flash memory products through retail and oem channels and its crucial technology division sells memory products through a webbased customer direct sales channel the company’s products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by the company and are compensated on a commission basis the company makes shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry the company’s products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors’ products 

the company offers products designed to meet the diverse needs of computing server automotive networking security commercialindustrial consumer electronics medical and mobile applications many of the company’s customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several months as the company further diversifies its product lines and reduces the die sizes of existing products more products become subject to qualification which may delay volume introduction of specific devices by the company 

backlog 

because of volatile industry conditions customers are reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for the company’s semiconductor products fluctuate significantly orders are typically accepted with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment customers can change delivery schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty for these reasons the company does not believe that its order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

product warranty 

because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that the company may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice the company generally provides a limited warranty that its products are in compliance with company specifications existing at the time of delivery under the company’s general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances the company may provide more extensive limited warranty coverage and general legal principles may impose more extensive liability than that provided under the company’s general terms and conditions 

competition 

the company faces intense competition in the semiconductor memory markets from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc qimonda ag ads samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation toshiba corporation and emerging companies in taiwan and china some of the company’s competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which the company competes invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities the company’s competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs these factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices 

the company faces competition in the image sensor market from a number of suppliers of cmos image sensors including magnachip semiconductor ltd omnivision technologies inc samsung electronics co ltd sony corporation stmicroelectronics nv toshiba corporation and from a number of suppliers of ccd image sensors including matsushita electric industrial co ltd sharp corporation and sony corporation in recent periods a number of new companies have entered the cmos image sensor market competitors include many large domestic and international companies that may have greater presence in key markets better access to certain customer bases greater name recognition and more established strategic and financial relationships than the company 

research and development 

to compete in the semiconductor memory industry the company must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes the company believes that expansion of its semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory and imaging solutions the company has several product design centers around the world the largest located at its corporate headquarters in boise idaho in addition the company develops leading edge photolithography mask technology at its mp mask joint venture facility in boise 

research and development “rd” expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture its products the company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification the company and intel share rd process and design costs for nand flash equally product development costs are recorded as rd expense 

the company’s process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate the company’s transition to next generation memory products and cmos image sensors additional process technology rd efforts focus on advanced computing and mobile memory architectures and new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts are concentrated on the company’s 1 gb and 2 gb ddr2 and ddr3 products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including mlc technology cmos image sensors and specialty memory products the company’s rd expenses were 805 million 656 million and 604 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements made by or on behalf of the company 

we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business 

in 2007 average selling prices for dram products and nand flash products decreased 23 and 56 respectively as compared to 2006 in recent years we have also experienced annual decreases in per megabit average selling prices for our memory products including 34 in 2006 24 in 2005 17 in 2003 53 in 2002 and 60 in 2001 at times average selling prices for our memory products have been below our costs if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per megabit costs as they recently have our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc qimonda ag ads samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation toshiba corporation and from emerging companies in taiwan and china who have significantly expanded the scale of their operations some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities 

our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs the transitions to smaller linewidth process technologies and 300mm wafers in the industry have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and will likely lead to future increases increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production we and several of our competitors have significantly increased production in recent periods through construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to reduce our per megabit manufacturing costs at the same rate as we have in the past 

our gross margins are dependent upon continuing decreases in per unit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes including reducing the die size of our existing products in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per unit manufacturing costs at sufficient levels to increase gross margins due to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the increasing complexity of manufacturing processes changes in process technologies or products which inherently may require relatively larger die sizes per unit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of imaging and certain specialty memory products 

depressed pricing for semiconductor memory products may lead to future losses and inventory writedowns 

we recorded an inventory writedown of 20 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 as a result of the significant decreases in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products if average selling prices are below our costs in future periods we expect to incur losses on product sales and our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected if the estimated market values of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date are below the manufacturing cost of these products we recognize charges to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of our inventories to market value future charges for inventory writedowns could be significantly larger than the 20 million recorded in 2007 

our plans to significantly increase our nand flash memory production and sales have numerous risks 

we plan to significantly increase our nand flash production and sales in future periods as part of this plan we have formed several manufacturing joint ventures with intel and made substantial investments in capital expenditures for equipment new facilities and research and development our plans also require significant investments in capital expenditures and research and development we currently expect our capital spending for 2008 to approximate 25 billion with a majority of the expenditures being made to support our nand operations these investments involve numerous risks in addition we are required to devote a significant portion of our existing semiconductor manufacturing capacity to the production of nand flash instead of the companys other products we are party to a contract with apple inc to provide nand flash products for an extended period of time at contractually determined prices we currently have a relatively small share of the worldwide market for nand flash 

our nand flash strategy involves numerous risks and may include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our nand flash strategy may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the future success of our imaging business will be dependent on continued market acceptance of our products and the development introduction and marketing of new imaging products 

we face competition in the image sensor market from a number of suppliers of cmos image sensors including magnachip semiconductor ltd omnivision technologies inc samsung electronics co ltd sony corporation stmicroelectronics nv toshiba corporation and from a number of suppliers of ccd image sensors including matsushita electric industrial co ltd sharp corporation and sony corporation in recent periods a number of new companies have entered the cmos image sensor market competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have greater presence in key markets better access to certain customer bases greater name recognition and more established strategic and financial relationships than the company 

our imaging net sales and gross margins decreased in 2007 and we faced increased competition there can be no assurance that we will be able to grow or maintain our market share or gross margins for imaging products in the future the success of our imaging business will depend on a number of factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

the company is exploring business model alternatives for its imaging business including partnering arrangements to the extent we form a partnering arrangement the resulting business model may not be successful and the imaging operations revenues and margins could be adversely affected we may incur significant costs to convert imaging operations to a new business structure and operations could be disrupted if our efforts to restructure the imaging business are unsuccessful our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and cmos image sensors sold average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology facilities and capital equipment research and development and product and process technology we expect capital spending for 2008 to approximate 25 billion cash and investments of im flash and tech are generally not available to finance our other operations in addition to cash provided by operations we have from time to time utilized external sources of financing access to capital markets has historically been very important to us depending on market conditions we may issue registered or unregistered securities to raise capital to fund a portion of our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations make adequate capital investments or access capital markets on acceptable terms and an inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

we expect to make future acquisitions and alliances which involve numerous risks 

acquisitions and the formation of alliances such as joint ventures and other partnering arrangements involve numerous risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

acquisitions of or alliances with hightechnology companies are inherently risky and any future transactions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not realize the expected benefits of new initiatives to reduce costs and increase revenue across our operations 

we are pursuing a number of initiatives to reduce costs and increase revenue across our operations these initiatives include workforce reductions in certain areas as we realign our business additional initiatives include establishing certain operations closer in location to our global customers evaluating functions more efficiently performed through partnerships or other outside relationships and reducing our overhead costs to meet or exceed industry benchmarks we are also exploring opportunities to leverage our technology and diversified product portfolio to increase revenue and shareholder value in the fourth quarter of 2007 we incurred a restructure charge of 19 million consisting primarily of employee severance and related costs resulting from a reduction in our workforce we anticipate that we will incur some level of restructure charges through the end of 2008 as we continue to implement these initiatives we may not realize the expected benefits of these new initiatives as a result of these initiatives we expect to incur restructuring or other infrequent charges and we may experience disruptions in our operations loss of key personnel and difficulties in delivering products timely 

our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited 

we have significant net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we have provided significant valuation allowances against the tax benefit of such losses as well as certain tax credit carryforwards utilization of these net operating losses and credit carryforwards is dependent upon us achieving sustained profitability as a consequence of prior business acquisitions utilization of the tax benefits for some of the tax carryforwards is subject to limitations imposed by section 382 of the internal revenue code and some portion or all of these carryforwards may not be available to offset any future taxable income the determination of the limitations is complex and requires significant judgment and analysis of past transactions 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap and are reported in us dollars across our multinational operations there are transactions and balances denominated in other currencies primarily the euro yen and singapore dollar we estimate that based on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than us dollar as of august 30 2007 a 1 change in the exchange rate versus the us dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately us 3 million for the singapore dollar us 2 million for the euro and us 1 million for the yen in the event that the us dollar weakens significantly compared to the singapore dollar euro or yen our results of operations or financial condition will be adversely affected 

new product development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop nand flash imaging and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture these new products that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will recover costs of development efforts 

an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights in this regard we are engaged in litigation with rambus inc rambus relating to certain of rambus patents and certain of our claims and defenses on august 28 2000 we filed a complaint subsequently amended against rambus in the us district court for the district of delaware seeking monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief among other things our amended complaint alleges violation of federal antitrust laws breach of contract fraud deceptive trade practices and negligent misrepresentation the complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment a that certain rambus patents are not infringed by us are invalid andor are unenforceable b that we have an implied license to those patents and c that rambus is estopped from enforcing those patents against us on february 15 2001 rambus filed an answer and counterclaim in delaware denying that we are entitled to relief alleging infringement of the eight rambus patents named in our declaratory judgment claim and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief a number of other suits are pending in europe alleging that certain of our sdram and ddr sdram products infringe various of rambus country counterparts to its european patent 525 068 including on september 1 2000 rambus filed suit against micron semiconductor deutschland gmbh in the district court of mannheim germany on september 22 2000 rambus filed a complaint against us and reptronic a distributor of our products in the court of first instance of paris france and on september 29 2000 we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of milan italy alleging invalidity and noninfringement in addition on december 29 2000 we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of avezzano italy alleging invalidity and noninfringement of the italian counterpart to european patent 1 004 956 additionally other suits are pending alleging that certain of our ddr sdram products infringe rambus country counterparts to its european patent 1 022 642 including on august 10 2001 rambus filed suit against us and assitec an electronics retailer in the civil court of pavia italy and on august 14 2001 rambus filed suit against micron semiconductor deutschland gmbh in the district court of mannheim germany in the european suits against us rambus is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief subsequent to the filing of the various european suits the european patent office declared rambus 525 068 and 1 004 956 european patents invalid and revoked the patents on january 13 2006 rambus filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california alleging infringement of eighteen rambus patents we are also engaged in litigation with mosaid technologies inc mosaid on july 24 2006 we 

 

filed a declaratory judgment action against mosaid in the us district court for the northern district of california seeking among other things a court determination that fourteen mosaid patents are invalid not enforceable andor not infringed on july 25 2006 mosaid filed a lawsuit against us and others in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging infringement of nine mosaid patents on august 31 2006 mosaid filed an amended complaint adding two additional mosaid patents on october 23 2006 the california court dismissed our declaratory judgment suit based on lack of jurisdiction we have appealed that decision to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit 

among other things the above lawsuits pertain to certain of our sdram ddr sdram ddr2 sdram rldram and image sensor products which account for a significant portion of our net sales 

a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms

we are unable to predict the outcome of these cases a court determination in any of the class actions against us could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

sales to customers outside the united states approximated 70 of our consolidated net sales for 2007 in addition we have manufacturing operations in china italy japan puerto rico and singapore our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these factors may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per megabit manufacturing costs additionally our control over operations at our im flash tech and mp mask joint ventures may be limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced minor disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages or equipment failures if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

disruptions in our supply of raw materials could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases lead frames and molding compound 

shortages may occur from time to time in the future in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

disruptions in our supply of raw materials could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses if despite design review quality control and product qualification procedures problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

 

 

economic and political conditions may harm our business 

global economic conditions and the effects of military or terrorist actions may cause significant disruptions to worldwide commerce if these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders a decrease in corporate spending on information technology or our inability to effectively market manufacture or ship our products global economic conditions may also affect consumer demand for devices that incorporate our products such as mobile phones personal computers flash memory cards and usb devices as a result our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected

overview 

the company is a global manufacturer of semiconductor devices principally semiconductor memory products including dram and nand flash and cmos image sensors the company operates in two segments memory and imaging its products are used in a broad range of electronic applications including personal computers workstations network servers mobile phones and other consumer applications including flash memory cards usb storage devices digital still cameras mp34 players and in automotive applications the company markets its products through its internal sales force independent sales representatives and distributors primarily to original equipment manufacturers and retailers located around the world the company’s success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of a diversified portfolio of semiconductor memory products efficient utilization of the company’s manufacturing infrastructure successful ongoing development of advanced process technologies and generation of sufficient return on research and development investments 

the company is focused on improving its competitiveness by increasing manufacturing scale improving its cost competitiveness and expanding its product portfolio within the semiconductor memory market the company has increased its manufacturing scale in 2007 by ramping nand flash production at two 300mm wafer fabrication facilities and beginning the conversion of another facility to 300mm dram wafer fabrication the company continues to explore other options to increase its manufacturing scale to reduce costs the company is implementing restructure initiatives aimed at reducing manufacturing and overhead costs through outsourcing relocation of operations and workforce reductions in recent years the company has strategically entered into the nand flash memory and specialty dram markets and has experienced significant revenue growth from these products the company is able to leverage its existing product and process technology and semiconductor memory manufacturing expertise in these markets 

to improve its focus on the semiconductor memory market the company is exploring business model alternatives for its imaging business including partnering arrangements under any of the alternatives being considered the company expects that it will continue to manufacture cmos image sensors 

the company has partnered with intel to form two nand flash manufacturing joint ventures im flash technologies llc and im flash singapore llp collectively “im flash” im flash operations include two 300mm wafer fabrication facilities that are expected to greatly increase the company’s production of nand flash in 2008 im flash singapore llp began construction of a new 300mm wafer fabrication facility in singapore in 2007 the company expects to contribute approximately 17 billion in cash to im flash over the next three years with similar contributions to be made by intel completion of the facility in singapore is subject to the mutual agreement of the joint venture partners as of august 30 2007 the company owned 51 and intel owned 49 of im flash the parties share output of im flash generally in proportion to their ownership in im flash 

the company makes significant ongoing investments to implement its proprietary product and process technology in its facilities in the united states europe and asia to manufacture semiconductor products with increasing functionality and performance at lower costs the company continues to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics such as higher data transfer rates reduced package size lower power consumption and increased memory density and megapixel count the company generally reduces the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technology such as its leadingedge line width process technology and innovative array architecture 

in order to maximize returns from investments in research and development “rd” the company develops process technology that effectively reduces production costs and leverages the company’s capital expenditures to be successfully incorporated in customers’ end products the company must offer qualified semiconductor solutions at a time when customers are developing their design specifications for their end products in addition dram and nand flash products necessarily incorporate highly advanced design and process technologies the company must make significant investments in rd to expand its product offering and develop its leadingedge product and process technologies to leverage its rd investments the company has formed strategic joint ventures under which the costs of developing nand flash memory product and process technologies are shared with its joint venture partner in addition from time to time the company has also sold andor licensed technology to third parties the company is pursuing further opportunities to recover its investment in intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements 

restructure the company is pursuing a number of initiatives to reduce costs and increase revenue across its operations these initiatives include workforce reductions in certain areas of the company as the company’s business is realigned additional initiatives include establishing certain operations closer in location to the company’s global customers evaluating functions more efficiently performed through partnerships or other outside relationships and reducing the company’s overhead costs to meet or exceed industry benchmarks the company is also exploring opportunities to leverage the company’s technology and diversified product portfolio to increase revenue and shareholder value it is anticipated that these initiatives will be implemented over several quarters 

in the fourth quarter of 2007 the company incurred a restructure charge of 19 million in connection with the implementation of these cost reduction initiatives the fourth quarter charge was comprised primarily of employee severance and related costs resulting from a reduction in the company’s workforce the company anticipates that it will incur some level of restructure charges through the end of 2008 as it continues to implement these initiatives but is currently unable to estimate the aggregate amount of such charges 

results of operations 

 

the company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53week period ending on the thursday closest to august 31 

net sales 

total net sales for 2007 increased 8 as compared to 2006 primarily due to an 11 increase in memory sales partially offset by an 8 decline in imaging sales memory sales for 2007 reflect a 204 increase in megabits sold partially offset by a 64 decline in per megabit average selling prices from 2006 memory sales were 88 of total net sales in 2007 compared to 86 in 2006 and 94 in 2005 imaging sales for 2007 decreased 8 from 2006 reflecting industry softness in mobile handset sales and pricing pressure total net sales for 2006 increased 8 as compared to 2005 primarily reflecting a 147 increase in imaging sales as memory sales declined 1 

memory memory sales for 2007 increased 11 from 2006 primarily due to a 287 increase in sales of nand flash products offset by an 11 decrease in sales of dram products 

sales of nand flash products for 2007 increased from 2006 primarily due to significant increases in megabits manufactured and the company’s acquisition of lexar media inc which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2006 partially offset by a 56 decline in average selling prices per megabit megabit production of nand flash products increased over 800 for 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to the ramp of nand flash products at the company’s 300mm fabrication facilities and transitions to higher density advanced geometry devices sales of nand flash products represented 23 of the company’s total net sales for 2007 as compared to 6 for 2006 the company expects that sales of nand flash products will continue to increase in 2008 as it continues to ramp production capacity at its 300mm wafer fabrication facilities 

sales of dram products for 2007 decreased from 2006 primarily due to a 23 decline in average selling prices which includes the effects of a 50 million charge to revenue in the first quarter of 2007 as a result of a settlement agreement with a class of direct purchasers of certain dram products which was partially mitigated by a 16 increase in megabits sold megabit production of dram products increased 23 for 2007 primarily due to transitions to higher density advanced geometry devices sales of ddr and ddr2 dram products were 47 of the company’s total net sales in 2007 as compared to 51 for 2006 and 59 for 2005 

memory sales for 2006 declined 1 from 2005 as a 287 increase in sales of nand flash products was offset by a 5 decrease in sales of dram products sales of nand flash products for 2006 increased from 2005 primarily due to a significant increase in megabits sold partially offset by an approximate 35 decline in average selling prices sales of nand flash products increased significantly for 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to significant increases in manufacturing resources allocated to their production the decrease in sales of dram products in 2006 from 2005 was the result of a 22 decline in average selling prices mitigated by a 22 increase in megabits sold megabit production of dram products increased 14 for 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to production efficiencies including improvements in product and process technologies partially offset by a reduction in wafer starts 

imaging imaging sales for 2007 decreased 8 from 2006 primarily due to declines in average selling prices as a result of industry softness in mobile handset sales and pricing pressure declines in average selling prices were partially mitigated by increased sales of higher resolution products imaging sales were 12 of the company’s total net sales in 2007 as compared to 14 for 2006 and 6 for 2005 imaging sales for 2006 increased by 147 from 2005 as unit sales tripled partially offset by a 19 decrease in average selling price per unit the decrease in average selling price per unit was due primarily to a significant increase of lower priced vga products sold in 2006 as compared to 2005 the growth in imaging unit sales for 2006 reflected strong demand for the company’s products and increased production 

gross margin 

the company’s overall gross margin percentage for 2007 declined to 19 from 23 for 2006 due to a decrease in both the gross margin percentages for memory and imaging products the company’s overall gross margin percentage of 23 for 2006 was unchanged from 2005 as a decrease in the gross margin percentage for memory in 2006 to 19 from 22 for 2005 was offset by a slight increase in the gross margin percentage for imaging products and a shift in product mix to higher margin imaging products 

memory the company’s gross margin percentage for memory products of 17 for 2007 declined from 19 for 2006 primarily due to the shift in product mix to nand flash products which had a significantly lower gross margin than dram products in 2007 this decline in gross margin percentage was mitigated by improvements in the gross margin for 2007 on sales of both dram and nand flash products as compared to 2006 

the gross margin for dram products for 2007 improved from 2006 primarily due to a 27 reduction in costs per megabit partially offset by a decline in average selling prices of 23 the company achieved cost reductions for dram products through transitions to production of devices utilizing the company’s advanced 78nm process technologies 

the company’s gross margin on nand flash products for 2007 improved slightly from 2006 primarily due to a 57 reduction in costs per megabit partially offset by a 56 decline in average selling prices cost reductions in 2007 reflect lower manufacturing costs lower costs of nand flash products purchased for sale under the company’s lexar brand and shifts in product mix the company achieved manufacturing cost reductions for nand flash products primarily through increased production of higherdensity advancedgeometry devices at the company’s 300mm fabrication facilities sales of nand flash products include sales from im flash to intel at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost im flash sales to intel were 255 million and 111 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively 

the company’s gross margin for memory in 2007 was adversely impacted by an inventory writedown of 20 million in the fourth quarter as a result of the significant decreases in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products the company may record additional writedowns in future periods if estimated average selling prices of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date are below the manufacturing cost of these products 

the company’s gross margin percentage for memory products declined to 19 for 2006 from 22 for 2005 primarily due to declining margins for nand flash products as a result of the 33 decrease in the average selling price per megabit and costs associated with the ramp in production at two facilities the gross margin percentage for dram products in 2006 was approximately the same as for 2005 as a 22 decrease in the average selling price per megabit was offset by cost reductions the company achieved cost reductions for dram products in 2006 through improved product yields and an increase in production utilizing the company’s 110nm and 95nm process technologies the cost per megabit for products manufactured on 300mm wafers decreased significantly in 2006 compared to 2005 as the company continued to increase 300mm wafer production 

in 2007 the company’s tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd “tech” joint venture supplied approximately 15 of the total megabits of memory produced by the company reflecting approximately 40 of total dram megabits tech primarily produced ddr and ddr2 products in 2007 and 2006 since the beginning of the third quarter of 2006 tech’s results have been included in the company’s consolidated results through the second quarter of 2006 the company’s results reflected memory products purchased from tech at prices generally based on a discount from average selling prices realized by the company for the preceding quarter in the first six months of 2006 the company realized higher gross margin percentages on sales of tech products than on sales of similar products manufactured by the company’s whollyowned operations since tech utilizes the company’s product designs and process technology and has a similar manufacturing cost structure the gross margin on sales of tech products since the third quarter of 2006 approximated those on sales of similar products manufactured by the company’s whollyowned operations in 2005 the company’s gross margin percentages on sales of tech products were approximately the same as on sales of similar products manufactured by the company’s whollyowned operations see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – joint ventures – tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd” 

imaging the company’s gross margin for imaging declined to 34 for 2007 from 43 for of 2006 primarily due to declines in average selling prices that were mitigated by cost reductions and shifts in product mix to higher resolution products the company’s gross margin percentage for imaging products for 2006 increased to 43 from 42 for 2005 primarily due to reductions in costs partially offset by decreases in average selling prices 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for 2007 increased 33 from 2006 primarily due to higher personnel costs and higher legal costs including a 31 million charge to sga as a result of the settlement of certain antitrust class action direct purchaser lawsuits personnel costs in 2007 increased from 2006 primarily due to increased headcount resulting from the acquisition of lexar in the fourth quarter of 2006 the formation of im flash in the second quarter of 2006 and subsequent ramp of its operations and the consolidation of tech in the third quarter of 2006 sga expenses for 2006 increased 32 from 2005 primarily due to higher compensation costs and increased costs associated with outstanding legal matters payroll costs in 2006 increased from 2005 primarily due to increased headcount resulting in part from the acquisition of lexar the ramp of im flash and the consolidation of tech the company expects sga expenses to approximate 125 million to 135 million for the first quarter of 2008 future sga expense is expected to vary potentially significantly depending on the number of legal matters that are resolved relatively early in their lifecycle and the number of matters that progress to trial the company is involved in a number of significant cases which are scheduled for trial in 2008 additionally the timing and final resolution of legal matters may cause sga expense to vary significantly for the company’s memory segment sga expenses as a percentage of sales were 11 in 2007 8 in 2006 and 7 in 2005 for the imaging segment sga expenses as a percentage of sales were 11 in 2007 12 in 2006 and 11 in 2005 

research and development 

research and development “rd” expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture its products the company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification as costs incurred in production prior to qualification are charged to rd 

rd expenses for 2007 increased 23 from 2006 principally due to nand preproduction wafer processing mitigated by reimbursements received from intel under a nand flash rd costsharing arrangement rd expenses were reduced by 240 million in 2007 and 86 million in 2006 for amounts reimbursable from intel under the nand flash rd costsharing arrangement rd expenses for 2006 increased 9 from 2005 principally due to increases in development wafers processed higher compensation costs and increases in rd equipment depreciation partially mitigated by reimbursements under the nand flash rd cost sharing arrangement the company expects that its rd expenses net of amounts reimbursable from intel will approximate 165 million to 175 million for the first quarter of 2008 for the memory segment rd expenses as a percentage of sales were 13 for 2007 13 for 2006 and 12 for 2005 for the imaging segment rd expenses as a percentage of sales were 23 for 2007 11 for 2006 and 23 for 2005 

the company’s process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate the company’s transition to nextgeneration memory products and cmos image sensors additional process technology rd efforts focus on advanced computing and mobile memory architectures and new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts are concentrated on the company’s 1 gb and 2 gb ddr2 and ddr3 products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including multilevel cell technology cmos image sensors and specialty memory products 

restructure 

the company is pursuing a number of initiatives to reduce costs and increase revenue across its operations these initiatives include workforce reductions in certain areas of the company as the company’s business is realigned additional initiatives include establishing certain operations closer in location to the company’s global customers evaluating functions more efficiently performed through partnerships or other outside relationships and reducing the company’s overhead costs to meet or exceed industry benchmarks the company is also exploring opportunities to leverage the company’s technology and diversified product portfolio to increase revenue and shareholder value it is anticipated that these initiatives will be implemented over several quarters 

in the fourth quarter of 2007 the company incurred a restructure charge of 19 million in connection with the implementation of these cost reduction initiatives the fourth quarter charge was comprised primarily of employee severance and related costs resulting from a reduction in the company’s workforce the company anticipates that it will incur some level of restructure charges through the end of 2008 as it continues to implement these initiatives but is currently unable to estimate the aggregate amount of such charges as of august 30 2007 5 million of the restructure costs remained unpaid and were included in accounts payable and accrued expenses 

other operating income expense net 

other operating income for 2007 includes 43 million from gains on disposals of semiconductor equipment a gain of 30 million from the sale of certain intellectual property rights and 7 million in grants received in connection with the company’s operations in china other operating expense for 2007 includes losses of 14 million from changes in currency exchange rates other operating income for 2006 includes 230 million of net proceeds for the sale of the company’s existing nand flash memory designs and certain related technology to intel net of amounts paid by the company for a perpetual paidup license to use and modify such designs other operating income for 2006 also includes 23 million in additional amounts expected to be reimbursed resulting from the extension of an economic development agreement which allows the company to recover amounts relating to certain investments in the im flash’s utah facility other operating income for 2005 includes gains net of losses on disposals of semiconductor equipment of 13 million and 12 million in receipts from the us government in connection with antidumping tariffs 

income taxes 

income taxes for 2007 and 2006 primarily reflect taxes on the company’s nonus operations and us alternative minimum tax the company has a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax asset associated with its us operations the benefit in 2007 and provision in 2006 for taxes on us operations was substantially offset by changes in the valuation allowance as of august 30 2007 the company had aggregate us tax net operating loss carryforwards of 22 billion and unused us tax credit carryforwards of 202 million the company also had unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of 15 billion and unused state tax credits of 169 million as of august 30 2007 substantially all of the net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2022 to 2027 and substantially all of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2013 to 2027 

noncontrolling interests in net income loss 

noncontrolling interests for 2007 and 2006 primarily reflects the share of income or losses of the company’s tech joint venture attributable to the noncontrolling interests in tech on march 30 2007 the company acquired all of the shares of tech common stock held by the singapore economic development board which had the effect of reducing the noncontrolling interests in tech as of that date from 57 to 27 see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – joint ventures – tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd” 

stockbased compensation 

through 2005 the company accounted for its stock plans using the intrinsic value method effective the beginning of 2006 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” which requires the company to use a fairvalue based method to account for stockbased compensation total compensation cost for the company’s equity plans in 2007 and 2006 was 44 million and 26 million respectively of which 3 million and 1 million were capitalized and remained in inventory at the end of 2007 and 2006 respectively as of august 30 2007 there was 113 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to equity plans which is expected to be recognized through the fourth quarter of 2011 in 2005 the company accelerated the vesting of substantially all of its unvested stock options then outstanding under the company’s stock plans to reduce compensation costs recognized subsequent to the adoption in 2006 of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” because the company’s stockbased compensation costs were reduced by the effect of the acceleration of vesting in 2005 the company expects that stockbased compensation costs will continue to grow in future periods 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s liquidity is highly dependent on average selling prices for its products and the timing of capital expenditures both of which can vary significantly from period to period as of august 30 2007 the company had cash and equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 26 billion compared to 31 billion as of august 31 2006 the balance as of august 30 2007 included an aggregate of 610 million held at and anticipated to be used in the near term by im flash and tech 

operating activities the company generated 937 million of cash from operating activities in 2007 which principally reflects the company’s 320 million of net loss adjusted by 17 billion for noncash depreciation and amortization expense net cash provided by operating activities was net of the effects of an increase of 591 million in inventories primarily due to increases in production growth in output that exceeded growth in demand for the company’s memory products and with respect to imaging industry softness in the mobile handset market 

investing activities net cash used by investing activities was 24 billion in 2007 which included cash expenditures for property plant and equipment of 36 billion partially offset by the net effect of purchases sales and maturities of investment securities of 12 billion a significant portion of the capital expenditures relate to the ramp of im flash facilities and 300mm conversion of manufacturing operations at tech the company believes that to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality it must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and capital equipment and research and development the company expects 2008 capital spending to approximate 25 billion primarily for expenditures on 300mm fabrication facilities the company expects that approximately 750 million of the capital expenditure requirement will come from joint venture partners through new investment and payment for product purchases as of august 30 2007 the company had commitments of approximately 12 billion for the acquisition of property plant and equipment nearly all of which are expected to be paid within one year 

on december 11 2006 the company acquired the cmos image sensor business of avago technologies limited the company made payments of 55 million in 2007 in connection with this acquisition and is obligated to make additional contingent payments up to 15 million if certain milestones are met through 2008

recently issued accounting standards 

in february 2007 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities – including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” under sfas no 159 the company may elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis subject to certain restrictions the company is required to adopt sfas no 159 effective at the beginning of 2009 the impact of the adoption of sfas no 159 will depend on the extent to which the company elects to measure eligible items at fair value 

in september 2006 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” in sab no 108 the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of a company’s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures sab no 108 permits companies to initially apply its provisions either by i restating prior financial statements or ii recording the cumulative effect as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings the company adopted sab no 108 as of august 30 2007 the adoption of sab no 108 did not impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas no 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income sfas no 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its yearend statement of financial position with limited exceptions the company adopted sfas no 158 as of august 30 2007 the adoption of sfas no 158 did not have a material impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements the company is required to adopt fas no 157 effective at the beginning of 2009 the company is evaluating the impact this statement will have on its consolidated financial statements 

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation number 48 “fin 48” “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes – an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 109 the first step is to evaluate each tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company is required to adopt fin 48 effective at the beginning of 2008 the company does not expect any material adjustments upon adoption 

in february 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 155 “accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments” sfas no 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation as of august 30 2007 the company did not have any hybrid financial instruments subject to the fair value election under sfas no 155 the company is required to adopt sfas no 155 effective at the beginning of 2008 

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” sfas no 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle the company adopted sfas no 154 at the beginning of 2007 the adoption of sfas no 154 did not impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

acquisitions and consolidations determination and the allocation thereof of the purchase price of acquired operations significantly influences the period in which costs are recognized accounting for acquisitions and consolidations requires the company to estimate the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired as well as various forms of consideration given the company typically obtains independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values including assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values the estimation of the fair values of consideration given and assets and liabilities acquired involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized 

contingencies the company is subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 

goodwill and intangible assets the company tests goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit determining whether impairment has occurred requires valuation of the respective reporting unit if the analysis indicates goodwill is impaired measuring the impairment requires a fair value estimate of each identified tangible and intangible asset the company tests other identified intangible assets with definite useful lives and subject to amortization when events and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset the company tests intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment using a fair value method such as discounted cash flows estimating fair values involves significant assumptions especially regarding future sales prices sales volumes costs and discount rates 

income taxes the company is required to estimate its provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year the company is also required to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of the company’s performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the company’s ability to generate future taxable income the company is required to adopt fin 48 effective at the beginning of 2008 

inventories inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value cost includes labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes the company reviews recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analysis of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated market values below the company’s manufacturing costs the company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded for example a 5 variance in the estimated selling prices would have changed the estimated fair value of the company’s semiconductor memory inventory by approximately 85 million at august 30 2007 due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories the company’s inventories have been categorized as memory products or imaging products the major characteristics the company considers in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 

product and process technology costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by the company are capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over periods currently ranging up to 10 years the company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents filed capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of i the estimated useful life of the technology ii the patent term or iii the term of the technology agreement 

research and development costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development when incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by the company the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability 

stockbased compensation under the provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fairvalue of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates the company develops its estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 

the company uses the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards the company estimates stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on the company’s stock estimated option life and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data for stock based compensation awards with graded vesting that were granted after 2005 the company recognizes compensation expense using the straightline amortization method

imaging complementary metaloxide semiconductor “cmos” image sensors are the primary product of the company’s imaging segment cmos image sensors are semiconductor devices that capture and process images into pictures or video for a variety of consumer and industrial applications the company’s cmos image sensors are used in products such as cellular phone cameras digital still cameras pill cameras for medical use and in automotive and other emerging applications the company offers image sensors in a range of pixel resolutions from its vga video graphics array products to its higher resolution 31megapixel products the company has begun sampling a 5megapixel sensor designed for use in digital still cameras and camera phones that it expects to begin shipping in commercial volumes in 2007 in 2006 the company introduced an 8megapixel sensor featuring a leadingedge pixel size of 175 square microns image sensors are sold either as individual components or combined with integrated circuitry to create complete camera systemonachip “soc” solutions

the company’s cmos image sensors incorporating its digitalclarity™ technology offered many advantages over other cmos image sensors and chargecoupled device “ccd” sensors in 2006 which enabled the company to become the leader in cmos image sensor market share the company’s digitalclarity™ technology features “active pixels” enabling better sensor performance that produces higherquality images at faster frame rates the company’s lowleakage dram processes are particularly wellsuited for the manufacture of cmos image sensors the company’s cmos image sensors consume substantially less power than ccd devices a critical advantage in batterydependent portable device applications where most

  

  

image sensors are used by combining all camera functions on a single chip from the capture of photons to the output of digital bits cmos image sensors reduce the partcount of a digital camera system which in turn increases reliability eases miniaturization and enables onchip programming of frame size windowing exposure and other camera parameters the company’s cmos image sensors are also capable of producing highquality images in lowlight conditions in 2006 the company’s cmos image sensors’ activepixel design architecture enabled the company to achieve cmos imager performance that was comparable to highend ccd sensors and better than that of its competitor’s cmos image sensors 

sales of imaging products were 14 6 and 2 of the company’s total net sales in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the company expects its sales of cmos image sensors to continue to grow in 2007 due to strong demand and increases in the allocation of manufacturing capacity the overall market for image sensors is expected to increase significantly over the next several years due to the growth forecasted for applications such as phone cameras and digital still cameras additionally cmos image sensors are expected to capture an increasing percentage of the overall image sensor market 

manufacturing the company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the united states italy japan puerto rico and singapore the company’s manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment most semiconductor equipment must be replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment 

the company’s process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly and test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment the company is continuously enhancing production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in 2006 t he company manufactured most of its dram products using its 95 nanometer “nm” and 110nm linewidth process technology and began transferring production to 78nm linewidth process technology the company expects to continue to transfer more of its dram production to 78nm and lower linewidth process technology in 2007 in 2006 the company manufactured most of its nand flash memory products using its 72nm and 90nm linewidth process technology the company expects to begin transferring its nand production to 50nm linewidth process technology in 2007 

wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls dust particles equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks and circuit design marginalities or defects can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional success of the company’s manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and thereby maximizing yield of highquality circuits in this regard the company employs rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes the company is able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

after fabrication silicon wafers are separated into individual die the company sells semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged ie “bare die” forms for packaged products functional die are sorted connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages the company assembles products in a variety of packages including tsop thin small outline package tqfp thin quad flat package and fbga f ine pitch ball grid array bare die products address customer requirements for smaller form factors and higher memory densities and provide superior flexibility bare die products are used in packaging technologies such as systemsinapackage sips and multichip packages mcps which reduce the board area required 

the company tests its products at various stages in the manufacturing process performs high temperature burnin on finished products and conducts numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition the company uses its proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of dram die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

  

  

the company assembles a significant portion of its memory products into memory modules memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards “pcbs” that insert directly into computer systems or other electronic devices the company’s lexar subsidiary contracts with an independent foundry and assembly and testing organizations to manufacture flash media products such as memory cards and usb devices 

in 2006 the company significantly increased its 300mm wafer production in 2007 the company plans to continue increasing its 300mm wafer manufacturing capacity as its imft subsidiary ramps nand flash production at two 300mm facilities and the company’s consolidated tech joint venture converts its dram production to 300mm wafers 

in recent years the company has produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances the company’s ability to allocate resources to its most profitable products but increases the complexity of the manufacturing process although new product lines such as nand flash cmos image sensors and specialty memory can be manufactured using processes that are very similar to the processes for the company’s predominant dram products frequent conversions to new products and the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts can affect the company’s cost efficiency the company’s ability to competitively manufacture many of these products on existing 200mm lines extends the useful life of this equipment 

im flash technologies llc “imft”   imft which began operations on january 6 2006 is a joint venture between the company and intel imft manufactures nand flash memory products pursuant to nand flash designs developed by the company and intel and licensed to the company the parties share the output of imft generally in proportion to their investment in imft the company owned a 51 interest in imft at august 31 2006 imft’s financial results are included in the consolidated financial statements of the company see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data — notes to consolidated financial statements — joint ventures — im flash technologies llc”

mp mask technology center llc “mp mask” in the third quarter of 2006 the company formed a joint venture mp mask with photronics inc “photronics” to produce photomasks for leadingedge and advanced next generation semiconductors the company contributed its then existing reticle manufacturing operation to the venture and sold a 4999 interest in mp mask to photronics the company and photronics also entered into supply arrangements wherein the company is expected to purchase a substantial majority of the reticles produced by mp mask the financial results of mp mask are included in the consolidated financial results of the company

availability of raw materials the company’s production processes require raw materials that meet exacting standards including several that are customized for or unique to the company the company generally has multiple sources of supply however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet the company’s standards various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases lead frames molding compound and other materials in addition any transportation problems could delay the company’s receipt of raw materials although raw materials shortages or transportation problems have not interrupted the company’s operations in the past shortages may occur from time to time in the future also lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if the company’s supply of raw materials is interrupted or lead times are extended results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

  

marketing and customers the company’s products are sold into computing and consumer networking and telecommunications and imaging markets approximately 70 of the company’s net sales for 2006 were to the computing market including desktop pcs notebooks servers and workstations sales to hewlettpackard company exceeded 10 of the company’s net sales in 2006 sales to both hewlettpackard company and dell computer corporation exceeded 10 of the company’s net sales in 2005 and 2004 and aggregated 23 and 27 of the company’s net sales in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

the company markets its semiconductor products primarily through its own direct sales force the company maintains inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of product shipments the company’s products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors lexar sells nand flash memory through retail and oem channels and crucial technology offers its products through the company’s webbased customer direct sales division the company’s products are offered under the micron lexar spectek and crucial brand names and under other private labels the company maintains sales offices in all of its primary markets around the world independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by the company and are compensated on a commission basis the company makes shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry the company’s products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors’ products 

the company offers products designed to meet the diverse needs of computing server automotive networking security commercialindustrial consumer electronics medical and mobile applications many of the company’s customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several months as the company further diversifies its product lines and reduces the die sizes of existing products more products become subject to qualification which may delay volume introduction of specific devices by the company 

backlog volatile industry conditions make customers reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for the company’s semiconductor products fluctuate significantly orders are typically accepted with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment customers can change delivery schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty for these reasons the company does not believe that its order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

product warranty because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that the company may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice the company generally provides a limited warranty that its products are in compliance with company specifications existing at the time of delivery under the company’s general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances the company may provide more extensive limited warranty coverage and general legal principles may impose more extensive liability than that provided under the company’s general terms and conditions 

competition the company faces intense competition in the semiconductor memory markets from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc qimonda ag ads samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation toshiba corporation and emerging companies in taiwan and china some of the company’s competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which the company competes invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities the company’s competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs these factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices

 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 

we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products which have adversely affected our business 

per megabit average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products decreased 34 in 2006 as compared to 2005 in recent years we have also experienced annual decreases in per megabit average selling prices for our memory products including 24 in 2005 17 in 2003 53 in 2002 and 60 in 2001 at times average selling prices for our memory products have been below our costs if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per megabit costs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

increased worldwide semiconductor memory production or lack of demand for semiconductor memory could lead to further declines in average selling prices 

the transitions to smaller linewidth process technologies and 300mm wafers in the industry have resulted in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and will likely lead to future increases increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production we and several of our competitors have announced plans to increase production through construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory if not accompanied with commensurate increases in demand would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may be unable to reduce our per megabit manufacturing costs at the same rate as we have in the past 

historically our gross margin has benefited from decreases in per unit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes including reducing the die size of our existing products in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per unit manufacturing costs or reduce these costs at historical rates due to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix the ever increasing complexity of manufacturing processes changes in process technologies or products which inherently may require relatively larger die sizes per unit manufacturing costs may also be affected by the relatively smaller production quantities and shorter product lifecycles of imaging and certain specialty memory products 

our formation of imft and the resulting plans to significantly increase our nand flash memory production has numerous risks 

on january 6 2006 we initiated operations of the imft joint venture with intel and as a result we plan to significantly increase our nand flash production in future periods the imft agreement and our nand flash strategy in general require substantial investment in capital expenditures for equipment and new facilities it also requires significant investments in research and development as well as investments to grow and develop new operations at multiple sites these investments involve numerous risks we are required to devote a significant portion of our existing semiconductor manufacturing capacity to the production of nand flash instead of the company’s other products in conjunction with the imft agreement we entered into a contract with apple corporation to provide nand flash products for an extended period of time at contractually determined prices we currently have a relatively small share of the worldwide market for nand flash 

our nand flash investments and commitments involve numerous risks and may include the following 

·   increasing our exposure to changes in average selling prices for nand flash

·   difficulties in establishing new production operations at multiple locations

·   increasing capital expenditures to increase production capacity and modify existing processes to produce nand flash

·   increasing debt to finance future investments

  

  

·   diverting management’s attention from dram and cmos image sensor operations

·   managing larger operations and facilities and employees in separate geographic areas and

·   hiring and retaining key employees

our nand flash strategy may not be successful and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the future success of our imaging business will be dependent on continued market acceptance of our products and the development introduction and marketing of new imaging products 

our imaging business has grown rapidly in the recent periods sales of imaging products increased substantially and represented 14 of our net sales in 2006 our imaging products have higher gross margins than the recent overall gross margins from our memory products as we continue to expand our imaging business there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these growth rates or gross margins the continued success of our imaging products will depend on a number of factors including 

·   development of products that maintain a technological advantage over the products of our competitors

·   accurate prediction of market requirements and evolving standards including pixel resolution output interface standards power requirements optical lens size input standards and other requirements

·   timely completion and introduction of new imaging products that satisfy customer requirements

·   timely achievement of design wins with prospective customers as manufacturers may be reluctant to change their source of components due to the significant costs time effort and risk associated with qualifying a new supplier and

·   efficient costeffective manufacturing as we transition to new products and higher volumes

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments 

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory and cmos image sensors sold average selling prices and per unit manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology facilities and capital equipment research and development and product and process technology cash and investments of imft and tech are generally not available to finance our other operations in addition to cash provided by operations we have from time to time utilized external sources of financing depending on general market and economic conditions or other factors we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments 

the semiconductor industry is highly competitive 

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc qimonda ag ads samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation toshiba corporation and from emerging companies in taiwan and china who have announced plans to significantly expand the scale of their operations some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs these factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices 

  

  

we face competition in the image sensor market from a number of suppliers of cmos image sensors including magnachip semiconductor ltd omnivision technologies inc samsung electronics co ltd sony corporation stmicroelectronics nv toshiba corporation and from a number of suppliers of ccd image sensors matsushita electric industrial co ltd sharp corporation and sony corporation in recent periods a number of new companies have entered the cmos image sensor market competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have greater presence in key markets better access to certain customer bases greater name recognition and more established strategic and financial relationships than the company 

we may have difficulty integrating the operations of lexar 

if we are unable to successfully combine and integrate the lexar operations we may not be able to realize many of the anticipated benefits of the merger which could harm our results of operations in order to realize the benefits of the merger we will need to timely integrate the technology operations and personnel of lexar integrating the two companies will be a complex timeconsuming and expensive process that even with proper planning and implementation could significantly disrupt the businesses of micron and lexar the challenges involved in this integration include combining product and service offerings optimizing inventory management over a broader distribution chain and preserving customer supplier and other important relationships of both micron and lexar if we are not able to successfully integrate our operations with those of lexar our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected by material weaknesses in lexar’s internal controls 

in lexar’s annual report on form 10k for the period ended december 31 2005 and its quarterly report on form 10q for the period ended march 31 2006 lexar reported material weaknesses with respect to its revenue recognition controls and inventory accounting controls these control deficiencies resulted in audit adjustments to revenues accounts receivable cost of product revenues deferred revenue sales related accruals and inventory in lexar’s 2005 consolidated financial statements as a result of these material weaknesses lexar concluded in its annual report and quarterly report that its control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of the periods covered by the reports while prior to the close of the merger lexar continued to take steps to remediate these material weaknesses there can be no assurance that we will be able to completely remediate these material weaknesses such that we will be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective we began consolidating the financial results of lexar on june 22 2006 however due to the recency of the acquisition the internal control over financial reporting relating to lexar was exempt from testing and evaluation as of august 31 2006 to the extent we do not remediate the material weaknesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting may be adversely affected 

our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result of the merger 

micron and lexar had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes prior to the merger and both entities had provided significant valuation allowances against the tax benefit of such losses as well as certain tax credit carryforwards utilization of these net operating losses and credit carryforwards are dependent upon us achieving profitable results following the lexar merger as a consequence of the merger as well as earlier issuances of common stock consummated by both companies and business combinations by the company utilization of the tax benefits of these carryforwards are subject to limitations imposed by section 382 of the internal revenue code the determination of the limitations is complex and requires significant judgment and analysis of past transactions accordingly some portion or all of these carryforwards may not be available to offset any future taxable income 

our resellers receive price protections which may have an adverse affect on our gross margins 

nearly all of our lexar sales are made through resellers which traditionally have been provided price protection in an environment of slower demand and abundant supply of products price declines and channel promotions expenses are more likely to occur further in this environment high channel inventory may result in substantial price protection charges these price protection charges have the effect of reducing gross sales and gross margin we expect to continue to incur price protection charges for the foreseeable future due to competitive pricing pressures and as a result our revenues and gross margins could be adversely affected 

  

  

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap and are reported in us dollars across our multinational operations there are transactions and balances denominated in other currencies primarily the yen and euro the company estimates that based on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than us dollar as of august 31 2006 a 1 change in the exchange rate versus the us dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately 1 million for the yen and 1 million for the euro in the event that the us dollar weakens significantly compared to the yen or euro our results of operations or financial condition will be adversely affected 

new product development may be unsuccessful 

we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we have made significant investments in product and process technologies and anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years the process to develop nand flash imaging and certain specialty memory products requires us to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance many times well in advance of a planned ramp of production in order to secure design wins with our customers there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture these new products that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will recover costs of development efforts 

an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights in this regard we are engaged in litigation with rambus inc “rambus” relating to certain of rambus’ patents and certain of our claims and defenses on august 28 2000 we filed a complaint subsequently amended against rambus in the us district court for the district of delaware seeking monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief among other things our amended complaint alleges violation of federal antitrust laws breach of contract fraud deceptive trade practices and negligent misrepresentation the complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment a that certain rambus patents are not infringed by us are invalid andor are unenforceable b that we have an implied license to those patents and c that rambus is estopped from enforcing those patents against us on february 15 2001 rambus filed an answer and counterclaim in delaware denying that we are entitled to relief alleging infringement of the eight rambus patents named in our declaratory judgment claim and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief a number of other suits are pending in europe alleging that certain of our sdram and ddr sdram products infringe various of rambus’ country counterparts to its european patent 525 068 including on september 1 2000 rambus filed suit against micron semiconductor deutschland gmbh in the district court of mannheim germany on september 22 2000 rambus filed a complaint against us and reptronic a distributor of our products in the court of first instance of paris france and on september 29 2000 we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of milan italy alleging invalidity and noninfringement in addition on december 29 2000 we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of avezzano italy alleging invalidity and noninfringement of the italian counterpart to european patent 1 004 956 additionally other suits are pending alleging that certain of our ddr sdram products infringe rambus’ country counterparts to its european patent 1 022 642 including on august 10 2001 rambus filed suit against us and assitec an electronics retailer in the civil court of pavia italy and on august 14 2001 rambus filed suit against micron semiconductor deutschland gmbh in the district court of mannheim germany in the european suits against us rambus is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief subsequent to the filing of the various european suits the european patent office declared rambus’ 525 068 and 1 004 956 european patents invalid and revoked the patents on january 13 2006 rambus filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the northern district of california alleging infringement of eighteen rambus patents we also are engaged in litigation with tadahiro ohmi “ohmi” on june 2 2005 ohmi filed suit against us in the us district court for the eastern district of texas amended on august 31 2005 alleging infringement of a single ohmi patent we are also engaged in litigation with mosaid technologies inc “mosaid” on july 24 2006 we filed a declaratory judgment action against mosaid in the us district court for the northern district of california seeking among other things a court determination that fourteen mosaid patents are invalid not enforceable andor not infringed on july 26 2006 mosaid filed a lawsuit against us and others in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging infringement of nine mosaid patents on august 31 2006 mosaid filed an amended complaint adding two additional mosaid patents on october 23 2006 the california court dismissed our declaratory judgment suit based on lack of jurisdiction 

  

  

among other things the above lawsuits pertain to certain of our sdram ddr sdram ddr2 sdram rldram and image sensor products which account for a significant portion of our net sales 

  a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against us any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms

we are unable to predict the outcome of these cases a court determination in any of the class actions against us could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

current economic and political conditions may harm our business 

global economic conditions and the effects of military or terrorist actions may cause significant disruptions to worldwide commerce if these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders a decrease in corporate spending on information technology or our inability to effectively market manufacture or ship our products global economic conditions may also affect consumer demand for devices that incorporate our products such as mobile phones personal computers flash memory cards and usb devices as a result our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

sales to customers outside the united states approximated 67 of our consolidated net sales for 2006 in addition we have manufacturing operations in italy japan puerto rico and singapore our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

·   currency exchange rate fluctuations

·   export and import duties changes to import and export regulations and restrictions on the transfer of funds

·   political and economic instability

·   problems with the transportation or delivery of our products

·   issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest

·   longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and

·   compliance with trade and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions

these factors may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

if our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per megabit manufacturing costs additionally our control over operations at our imft tech and mp mask joint ventures may be limited by our agreements with our partners from time to time we have experienced minor disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages or equipment failures if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers’ requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition

disruptions in our supply of raw materials could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

  

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses if despite design review quality control and product qualification procedures problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

·   we may replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product and

·   we may encounter adverse publicity which could cause a decrease in sales of our products

we expect to make future acquisitions where advisable which involve numerous risks 

we expect to make future acquisitions where we believe it is advisable to enhance shareholder value acquisitions involve numerous risks including 

·   difficulties in integrating the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies

·   increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities

·   increasing debt to finance any acquisition

·   diverting management’s attention from normal daily operations

·   managing larger operations and facilities and employees in separate geographic areas and

·   hiring and retaining key employees

mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and future acquisitions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition

overview 

the company is a global manufacturer of semiconductor devices principally dram and nand flash memory products and cmos image sensors the company operates in two primary segments memory and imaging its products are used in a broad range of electronic applications including personal computers workstations network servers mobile phones and other consumer applications including flash memory cards usb storage devices digital still cameras mp3 players and in automotive applications the company’s customers are principally original equipment manufacturers located around the world the company’s success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of a diversified semiconductor product portfolio efficient utilization of the company’s manufacturing infrastructure successful ongoing development of advanced process technologies and generation of sufficient return on research and development investments 

the company has strategically diversified its business by expanding into semiconductor products such as specialty memory products including sdram psram mobile sdram and reduced latency dram nand flash memory products and cmos image sensors these products are used in a wider range of applications than the computing applications that use the company’s highest volume products ddr and ddr2 the company leverages its expertise in semiconductor memory manufacturing and product and process technology to provide these products that are differentiated from competitors’ products based on performance characteristics in 2006 approximately half of the company’s sales were other than pc dram products the company expects that the markets for these products will grow in the near term more rapidly than the overall semiconductor market the company believes the strategic diversification of its product portfolio will strengthen its ability to allocate manufacturing resources to achieve the highest rate of return 

as part of its diversification strategy the company took several steps towards establishing a significant presence in the nand flash market in 2006 in january 2006 the company partnered with intel to form a nand flash manufacturing joint venture im flash technologies llc imft initiated an accelerated build out and production ramp at two 300mm wafer fabrication facilities that are expected to greatly increase the company’s production of nand flash in 2007 in june 2006 the company acquired lexar media inc a designer developer manufacturer and marketer of flash memory products in a stockforstock merger see “recent developments” 

the company’s imaging segment experienced strong growth in 2006 as net sales increased 147 from 2005 and represented 14 of the company’s net sales for 2006 the company ramped production of imaging products at a second wafer fabrication facility in 2006 and expects to continue to allocate an increasing portion of its manufacturing capacity to cmos image sensors in 2007 

the company makes significant ongoing investments to implement its proprietary product and process technology in its facilities in the united states europe and asia to manufacture semiconductor products with increasing functionality and performance at lower costs the company continues to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics such as higher data transfer rates reduced package size lower power consumption and increased megapixel count the company generally reduces the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technology such as its leadingedge line width process technology and innovative array architecture 

  

in order to maximize returns from investments in research and development “rd” the company develops process technology that effectively reduces production costs and leverages the company’s capital expenditures to be successfully incorporated in customers’ end products the company must offer qualified semiconductor solutions at a time when customers are developing their design specifications for their end products this is especially true for specialty memory products and cmos image sensors which are required to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance well ahead of a planned ramp of production to commercial volumes in addition dram and nand flash products necessarily incorporate highly advanced design and process technologies the company must make significant investments in rd to expand its product offering and develop its leadingedge product and process technologies 

recent developments

results of operations 

   

the company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53week period ending on the thursday closest to august 31 the company’s fiscal 2006 and 2005 contained 52 weeks the company’s fiscal 2004 contained 53 weeks 

net sales 

total net sales for 2006 increased 8 as compared to 2005 primarily reflecting a 147 increase in imaging sales as memory sales declined 1 imaging sales increased in 2006 primarily due to significant increases in sales volume facilitated by a greater allocation of manufacturing capacity to imaging devices memory sales for 2006 reflect a 34 decline in per megabit average selling prices from 2005 partially offset by a 50 increase in megabits sold memory sales were 86 of total net sales in 2006 compared to 94 in 2005 and 98 in 2004 imaging sales have grown rapidly in recent periods and have represented an increasing portion of the company’s total net sales total net sales for 2005 increased 11 as compared to 2004 due to a 6 increase in memory sales and 206 increase in imaging sales 

memory   memory sales for 2006 declined 1 from 2005 as a 287 increase in nand flash sales was offset by a 5 decrease in dram sales the decrease in dram sales for 2006 was the result of a 22 decrease in average selling prices mitigated by a 22 increase in megabits sold dram megabit production increased 14 for 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to production efficiencies including improvements in product and process technologies partially offset by a reduction in wafer starts dram wafer starts decreased in 2006 as the company allocated an increasing portion of its manufacturing resources to imaging and nand flash memory products sales of ddr and ddr2 products decreased to 51 of the company’s total net sales in 2006 as compared to 59 for 2005 and 58 for 2004 reflecting the company’s progress in diversifying away from pc dram 

nand flash sales increased to 6 of the company’s total net sales for 2006 from 2 for 2005 primarily due to a significant increase in megabits sold of nand partially offset by an approximate 35 decrease in average selling prices nand flash megabit production increased significantly for 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to significant increases in manufacturing resources allocated to the production of nand flash sales of nand flash include sales from the company’s consolidated joint venture imft to intel at longterm negotiated prices approximating cost nand flash revenue in 2006 was not significantly affected by the acquisition of lexar on june 21 2006 as the company did not recognize revenue from lexar’s products that were in the distribution channel at the acquisition date the company expects that nand flash revenue will increase significantly in future periods as the company ramps additional production capacity through its imft joint venture and recognizes lexar sales for a full period 

memory sales for 2005 increased by 6 as compared to 2004 primarily due to a 40 increase in megabits sold partially offset by a 24 decrease in the overall average selling price per megabit for the company’s memory products the company’s overall megabit production in 2005 increased by 48 as compared to 2004 principally due to a steep ramp in 300mm wafer production and gains in manufacturing efficiencies realized from improvements in product and process technologies the company’s megabit production exceeded megabit sales in 2005 which resulted in an approximate 170 increase in megabit finished goods inventories primarily consisting of ddr and ddr2 products most of the increase in memory sales in 2005 as compared to 2004 resulted from sales of the company’s emerging specialty memory products such as pseudostatic ram “psram” and mobile dram products and nand flash memory the company’s combined 

  

revenue from these products was 509 million in 2005 and nearly quintupled from 2004 due to large increases in production and strong demand for the company’s offerings in these product groups 

imaging imaging sales for 2006 increased by 147 from 2005 as unit sales tripled which was partially offset by a 19 decrease in average selling price per unit the decrease in average selling price per unit was due primarily to a significant increase of lower priced vga products sold in 2006 as compared to 2005 the growth in imaging unit sales for 2006 reflects strong demand for the company’s products and increased production production increased due to the allocation of more wafers to the manufacture of imaging products as well as improvements in manufacturing efficiency imaging sales were 14 of the company’s total net sales in 2006 as compared to 6 for 2005 and 2 for 2004 imaging sales for 2005 increased by 206 as compared to 2004 primarily due to increases in unit sales as average selling price per unit were essentially unchanged the growth in imaging unit sales for 2005 reflects increased production due to strong demand for the company’s products and the planned introduction of new products the company expects that revenue from imaging products will continue to increase in 2007 as additional manufacturing capacity is allocated to the production of these products 

gross margin 

the company’s overall gross margin percentage of 23 for 2006 was unchanged from 2005 as a decrease in the gross margin percentage for memory in 2006 to 19 from 22 for 2005 was offset by a slight increase in the gross margin percentage for imaging products and a shift in product mix to higher margin imaging products the company’s overall gross margin percentage for 2005 declined to 23 as compared to 30 for 2004 primarily due to a decline in gross margin for memory products as a result of decreases in average selling prices per megabit partially offsetting the effect of the decline in average selling prices in 2005 from 2004 was a reduction in cost of goods sold per megabit and the increase in sales of cmos image sensors specialty memory and nand flash products which had significantly higher margins than ddr and ddr2 products in 2005 

memory   the company’s gross margin percentage for memory products for 2006 of 19 decreased from 22 for 2005 primarily due to declining margins for nand flash products as a result of the 33 decrease in the average selling price per megabit and costs associated with ramp in production at two facilities the gross margin percentage for dram products in 2006 of 23 was approximately the same as for 2005 as a 22 decrease in the average selling price per megabit was offset by cost reductions the company achieved cost reductions for dram products in 2006 through improved product yields and an increase in production utilizing the company’s 110nm and 95nm process technologies the cost per megabit for products manufactured on 300mm wafers decreased significantly in 2006 compared to 2005 as the company continued to increase 300mm wafer production 

the company’s gross margin percentage for memory products for 2005 declined to 22 as compared to 30 for 2004 this decline in gross margin was primarily due to the 24 decrease in the company’s overall average selling price per megabit of memory and to a lesser extent a shift in product mix from ddr to ddr2 products which had lower margins in 2005 partially offsetting this decline in gross margin from 2005 to 2004 were reductions in product costs and the increase in sales of specialty memory and nand flash products which had significantly higher margins than ddr and ddr2 products the company reduced dram product costs through manufacturing efficiencies achieved from improved product yields and increases in production utilizing the company’s 110nm and 95nm process technology the cost per megabit for products manufactured on 300mm wafers decreased significantly in 2005 compared to 2004 as the company increased 300mm wafer production

the company’s tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd “tech” joint venture supplied approximately 25 of the total megabits of memory produced by the company in recent periods tech primarily produced ddr and ddr2 products in 2006 and 2005 through the second quarter of 2006 the company purchased memory products from tech at prices generally based on a discount from average selling prices realized by the company for the preceding quarter in the first six months of 2006 the company realized higher gross margin percentages on sales of tech products than on sales of similar products manufactured by the company’s whollyowned operations as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2006 tech’s results are included in the company’s consolidated results tech utilizes the company’s product designs and process technology and as a result the gross margin percentage on sales of tech products for the last six months of 2006 approximated those on sales of similar products manufactured by the company’s whollyowned operations see “recent developments – tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd” 

imaging   the company’s gross margin percentage for imaging products for 2006 increased to 43 from 42 for 2005 primarily due to reductions in costs partially offset by decreases in average selling prices the company’s gross margin percentage for imaging products increased to 42 for 2005 from 25 for 2004 primarily due to cost reductions as the overall average selling price per unit was essentially unchanged

  

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for 2006 increased 32 from 2005 primarily due to higher compensation costs and increased costs associated with outstanding legal matters payroll costs in 2006 increased from 2005 primarily due to increased headcount resulting in part from the acquisition of lexar the ramp of imft and the consolidation of tech sga expenses for 2005 increased 5 from 2004 primarily due to higher compensation costs partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with legal matters the company expects sga expenses to approximate 140 million for the first quarter of 2007 in 2006 sga expense for memory was approximately 8 of memory sales and sga expense for imaging was approximately 12 of imaging sales 

research and development 

research and development “rd” expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture its products the company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification as costs incurred in production prior to qualification are charged to rd 

rd expenses for 2006 increased 9 from 2005 principally due to increases in development wafers processed higher compensation costs and increases in rd equipment depreciation the company and intel share rd process and design costs for nand flash equally in 2006 the company charged 86 million to intel under this nand flash rd cost sharing arrangement rd expenses for 2005 decreased 20 from 2004 principally because products were qualified on the 300mm wafer fabrication process in the first quarter of 2005 the company expects that its rd costs will approximate 175 million for the first quarter of 2007 in 2006 rd expense for memory was approximately 13 of memory sales and rd expense for imaging was approximately 11 of imaging sales 

the company’s process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of successively smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate the company’s transition to next generation memory products and cmos image sensors additional process technology rd efforts focus on specialty memory products including psram mobile sdram and reduced latency dram and new manufacturing materials product design and development efforts are concentrated on the company’s 1 gb and 2 gb ddr ddr2 and ddr3 products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory including multilevel cell technology cmos image sensors and specialty memory products 

other operating income expense net 

other operating income for 2006 includes 230 million of net proceeds for the sale of the company’s existing nand flash memory designs and certain related technology to intel net of amounts paid by the company for a perpetual paidup license to use and modify such designs other operating income for 2006 also includes 23 million in additional amounts expected to be reimbursed resulting from the extension of an economic development agreement which allows the company to recover amounts relating to certain investments in the imft lehi facility other operating income for 2005 includes gains net of losses on disposals of semiconductor equipment of 13 million and 12 million in receipts from the us government in connection with antidumping tariffs other operating expense for 2004 includes losses of 17 million from changes in currency exchange rates other operating income for 2004 includes 7 million from the commonwealth of virginia for meeting investment commitments at the virginia wafer fabrication facility and net gains of 4 million on writedowns and disposals of semiconductor equipment 

income taxes 

income taxes for 2006 and 2005 primarily reflect taxes on the company’s nonus operations and us alternative minimum tax the company has a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax asset associated with its us operations the provision for taxes on us operations in 2006 and 2005 was substantially offset by reductions in the valuation allowance as of august 31 2006 the company had aggregate us tax net operating loss carryforwards of 17 billion and unused us tax credit carryforwards of 164 million the company also has unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of 14 billion and unused state tax credits of 163 million substantially all of the net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2022 to 2025 and substantially all of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2013 to 2026 during 2006 the company utilized approximately 11 billion of its us tax net operating loss carryforwards as a result of imft mp mask and related transactions see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – joint ventures – im flash technologies llc” and “joint ventures – mp mask technology center llc” notes 

  

stockbased compensation 

through 2005 the company accounted for its stock plans using the intrinsic value method effective the beginning of 2006 the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” and elected to adopt the modified prospective application method sfas no 123r requires the company to use a fairvalue based method to account for stockbased compensation accordingly stockbased compensation cost is measured as of the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the employees’ requisite service period total compensation cost for the company’s equity plans in 2006 was 26 million of which 1 million was capitalized and remained in inventory at august 31 2006 as of august 31 2006 there was 77 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to equity plans which is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 15 years in 2005 the company accelerated the vesting of substantially all of its unvested stock options then outstanding under the company’s stock plans to reduce compensation costs recognized subsequent to the adoption of sfas 123r because the company’s nearterm stockbased compensation costs were reduced by the acceleration of vesting in 2005 stockbased compensation costs will grow significantly in future periods if the company continues to grant amounts of new stockbased compensation awards similar to recent periods 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company’s liquidity is highly dependent on average selling prices for its products and the timing of capital expenditures both of which can vary significantly from period to period as of august 31 2006 the company had cash and marketable investment securities totaling 31 billion compared to 13 billion as of september 1 2005 the company’s cash and marketable investment securities as of august 31 2006 included 875 million held at and anticipated to be used in the near term by imft and tech

  offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of august 31 2006 the company had stock warrants outstanding that may be considered offbalance sheet arrangements in 2001 the company received 480 million from the issuance of warrants to purchase 291 million shares of the company’s common stock the warrants entitle the holders to exercise their warrants and purchase shares of the company’s common stock for 5600 per share the “exercise price” at any time through may 15 2008 the “expiration date” warrants exercised prior to the expiration date will be settled on a “net share” basis wherein investors receive common stock equal to the difference between 5600 and the average closing sale price for the common shares over the 30 trading days immediately preceding the exercise date at expiration the company may elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis or for cash provided certain conditions are satisfied as of august 31 2006 there had been no exercises of warrants and all warrants issued remained outstanding 

the company has an agreement to construct a facility to produce photomasks and sell such facility to its mp mask joint venture partner photronics inc for a negotiated amount the company does not expect to incur a loss on such sale 

recently issued accounting standards 

in september 2006 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin “sab” no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements” in sab no 108 the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company’s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures sab no 108 permits existing public companies to initially apply its provisions either by i restating prior financial statements or ii recording the cumulative effect as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings the company is required to adopt sab no 108 by the end of 2007 and does not expect adoption to have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas no 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income sfas no 158 also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its yearend statement of financial position with limited exceptions under fas no 158 the company is required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of 2007 the company is evaluating the impact this statement will have on its consolidated financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements fas no 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements the company is required to adopt fas no 157 effective at the beginning of 2009 the company is evaluating the impact this statement will have on its consolidated financial statements 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation number 48 “fin 48” “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 109 the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement the company is required to adopt fin 48 effective at the beginning of 2008 the company is evaluating the impact this statement will have on its consolidated financial statements 

in february 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 155 “accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments” sfas no 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation as of august 31 2006 the company did not have any hybrid financial instruments subject to the fair value election under sfas no 155 the company is required to adopt sfas no 155 effective at the beginning of 2008 

  

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” sfas no 154 changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle the company is required to adopt sfas no 154 for accounting changes and error corrections that occur after the beginning of 2007 the company’s results of operations and financial condition will only be impacted following the adoption of sfas no 154 if it implements changes in accounting principle that are addressed by the standard or corrects accounting errors in future periods 

in march 2005 the fasb issued interpretation no 47 “fin 47” “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” which clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement the company adopted fin 47 in the third quarter of 2006 the adoption of fin 47 did not have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

acquisitions and consolidations   determination and the allocation thereof of the purchase price of acquired operations significantly influences the period in which costs are recognized accounting for acquisitions and consolidations requires the company to estimate the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired as well as various forms of consideration given the company typically obtains independent third party valuation studies to assist in determining fair values which may include assistance in determining future cash flows appropriate discount rates and comparable market values the estimation of the fair values of consideration given and assets and liabilities acquired involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized 

contingencies   the company is subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 

income taxes   the company is required to estimate its provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year the company is also required to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of the company’s performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the company’s ability to generate future taxable income 

inventories   inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value cost includes labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes the company reviews recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analysis of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated market values below the company’s manufacturing costs the company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

  

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories the company’s inventories have been categorized as memory products or imaging products the major characteristics the company considers in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 

product and process technology   costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by the company are capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over periods currently ranging up to 10 years the company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents filed capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of i the estimated useful life of the technology ii the patent term or iii the term of the technology agreement

property plant and equipment   the company reviews the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by the company including but not limited to future use of the assets for company operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for the company’s products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required by the company in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed 

research and development   costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development when incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by the company the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability 

stockbased compensation   in 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r using the modified prospective application method and began accounting for its stockbased compensation using a fairvalued based recognition method under the provisions of sfas no 123r stockbased compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fairvalue of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility expected option life and forfeiture rates the company develops its estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 

the company uses the blackscholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards the company estimates stock price volatility based on an average of its historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on the company’s stock estimated option life and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data for stock based compensation awards with graded vesting that were granted after 2005 the company recognizes compensation expense using the straightline amortization method

the company’s cmos image sensors incorporating its digitalclarity™ technology have many advantages over other cmos image sensors and chargecoupled device “ccd” sensors the company’s digitalclarity™ technology features “active pixels” enabling better sensor performance that produces higherquality images at faster frame rates unlike ccd sensors which rely on specialized fabrication requiring dedicated and costly manufacturing processes cmos image sensors can be manufactured using standardized semiconductor processes resulting in substantially lower costs the company’s lowleakage dram processes are particularly wellsuited for the manufacture of cmos image sensors the company’s cmos image sensors consume substantially less power than ccd devices a critical advantage in the batterydependent portable device applications where most image sensors are used by combining all camera functions on a single chip from the capture of photons to the output of digital bits cmos image sensors reduce the partcount of a digital camera system which in turn increases reliability eases miniaturization and enables onchip programming of frame size windowing exposure and other camera parameters the company’s cmos image sensors are also capable of producing highquality images in lowlight conditions the company’s cmos image sensors’ activepixel design architecture enables them to achieve performance comparable to highend ccd sensors and higher than competitor’s cmos image sensors 

  

the company’s sales of cmos image sensors for 2005 increased over 200 from 2004 in the fourth quarter of 2005 sales of cmos image sensors were 9 of the company’s net sales the company expects its sales of cmos image sensors to continue to grow rapidly in 2006 due to strong demand and increases in the allocation of manufacturing capacity the overall market for image sensors is expected to increase significantly over the next several years due to the growth forecasted for applications such as phone cameras and digital still cameras additionally cmos image sensors are expected to capture an increasing percentage of the overall image sensor market 

  

manufacturing   

the company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the united states italy japan puerto rico scotland and singapore the company’s manufacturing facilities generally operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment most semiconductor equipment must be replaced every three to five years with increasingly advanced equipment 

  

the company’s process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly burnin and final test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of good die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment the company is continuously enhancing production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in 2005 the company manufactured most of its products using its 110 nanometer “nm” linewidth process technology and began transferring its manufacturing operations to 95nm linewidth process technology the company expects to continue to transfer more of its manufacturing operation to 95nm and lower linewidth process technology in 2006 in 2005 most of the company’s dram products incorporated its 6f² hypershrink™ array architecture technology a design rule that incorporates a memory cell in 6 design features rather and the industry standard 8 design features which enables production of approximately 20 more die per wafer 

  

  

wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls dust particles equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks and circuit design marginalities or defects which can lead to wafers being scrapped and individual circuits being nonfunctional success of the company’s manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and thereby maximizing yield of highquality circuits in this regard the company employs rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes the company is able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

  

after fabrication silicon wafers are separated into individual die functional die are sorted connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages the company assembles products in a variety of packages including tsop thin small outline package tqfp thin quad flat package and fbga fine pitch ball grid array each completed package is then inspected and tested the company also sells semiconductor products in an unpackaged or die form the company tests its products at various stages in the manufacturing process performs high temperature burnin on finished products and conducts numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition the company uses its proprietary ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of dram die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

  

a significant portion of the company’s memory products are assembled into memory modules for sale to customers memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards “pcbs” that insert directly into computer systems or other electronic devices memory components are attached to pcbs in a soldering process performed by screen printing machines and high speed automated pickandplace machines completed modules are tested by custom equipment and visually inspected 

  

in 2005 the company significantly increased its 300mm wafer production the company manufactured 256 meg and 512 meg ddr devices on the company’s 110nm process technology on 300mm wafers and manufactured the industry’s first memory devices in production to utilize copper interconnects in 2006 the company plans to continue increasing its 300mm wafer manufacturing capacity 

  

in recent years the company has produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products which enhances the company’s ability to allocate resources to its most profitable products but increases the complexity of the manufacturing process although new product lines such as nand flash cmos image sensors and specialty memory can be manufactured using processes that are very similar to the processes for the company’s predominant dram products frequent conversions to new products and the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex smallervolume parts can affect the company’s cost efficiency however the company’s ability to competitively manufacture many of these products on existing 200mm lines significantly extends the useful life of this equipment 

  

tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd “tech” tech is a memory manufacturing joint venture in singapore among micron technology inc the singapore economic development board canon inc and hewlettpackard company tech’s semiconductor manufacturing facilities use the company’s product and process technology subject to specific terms and conditions the company has agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by tech tech supplied approximately 25 30 and 30 of the total megabits of memory produced by the company in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the company generally purchases semiconductor memory products from tech at prices determined quarterly based on a discount from average selling prices realized by the company for the preceding fiscal quarter the company performs assembly and test services on product manufactured by tech the company also provides certain technology engineering and training to support tech all of these transactions with tech are recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from tech

  

availability of raw materials   

the company’s production processes require raw materials that meet exacting standards including several that are customized for or unique to the company the company generally has multiple sources of supply however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet the company’s standards various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases lead frames molding compound and other materials in addition any transportation problems could delay the company’s receipt of raw materials although raw materials shortages or transportation problems have not interrupted the company’s operations in the past shortages may occur from time to time in the future also lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if the company’s supply of raw materials is interrupted or lead times are extended results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

  

marketing and customers   

the company’s products are sold into computing and consumer networking and telecommunications and imaging markets approximately 70 of the company’s net sales for 2005 were to the computing market including desktop pcs notebooks servers and workstations sales to both dell computer corporation and hewlettpackard company exceeded 10 of the company’s net sales in 2005 2004 and 2003 and aggregated 23 27 and 28 of the company’s net sales in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

the company markets its semiconductor products primarily through its own direct sales force the company maintains inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of product shipments the company’s products are also offered through independent sales representatives distributors and crucial technology the company’s webbased customer direct sales division the company’s products are offered under the micron spectek and crucial brand names and under other private labels the company maintains sales offices in all of its primary markets around the world independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by the company and are compensated on a commission basis the company makes shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry the company’s products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors’ products 

  

segmentation of the memory market continues with diverse memory needs being driven by the different requirements of personal computers servers mobile devices and communications consumer and other applications that demand specific memory solutions many of the company’s customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products which may take several months as the company further diversifies its product lines and reduces the die sizes of existing memory products more products become subject to qualification which may delay volume introduction of specific devices by the company 

  

backlog   

volatile industry conditions make customers reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for the company’s semiconductor products fluctuate significantly orders are typically accepted with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment customers can change delivery schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty for these reasons the company does not believe that its order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

  

product warranty   

because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that the company may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice the company generally provides a limited warranty that its products are in compliance with company specifications existing at the time of delivery under the company’s general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances the company may provide more extensive limited warranty coverage and general legal principles may impose more extensive liability than that provided under the company’s general terms and conditions 

  

competition   

the company faces intense competition in the semiconductor memory markets from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag and samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation and toshiba corporation additionally the company faces competition from emerging companies in taiwan and china who have announced plans to significantly expand the scale of their operations the company faces competition in the image sensor market from a number of suppliers of cmos image sensors as well a large number of suppliers of ccd image sensors some of the company’s competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which the company competes invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities the company’s competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and 

  

  

minimize mask levels in their product designs these factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices 

  

research and development   

to compete in the semiconductor memory industry the company must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes the company believes that expansion of its semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions the company has several product design centers around the world the largest located at its corporate headquarters in boise idaho in addition the company has a facility at its boise site to develop leading edge photolithography mask technology 

  

rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture the company’s products the company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability and is internally qualified for sale to customers rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification product development costs are recorded as rd expense the company’s rd expenses were 6037 million 7549 million and 6564 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively

overview   

the company is a global manufacturer of semiconductor devices principally dram nand flash and cmos image sensors its products are used in a broad range of electronic applications including personal computers workstations network servers mobile phones and other consumer applications including flash memory cards usb storage devices digital still camera and mp3 players the company’s customers are principally original equipment manufacturers located around the world the company’s success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of a diversified semiconductor product portfolio efficient utilization of the company’s manufacturing infrastructure successful ongoing development of advanced process technologies and generation of sufficient return on research and development efforts 

  

the company has strategically diversified its business by expanding into semiconductor products such as specialty memory products including sdram psram mobile sdram and reduced latency dram nand flash memory products and cmos image sensors these products are used in a wider range of applications than the computing applications that use the company’s standardized dram products the company leverages its expertise in semiconductor memory manufacturing and product and process technology to provide these products that are differentiated from competitors’ products based on performance characteristics in the fourth quarter of 2005 specialty memory products nand flash products and cmos image sensors were over 45 of the company’s net sales the company expects that the markets for these products will grow more rapidly than the overall semiconductor market in the near term the company’s products have been well received in these growing customer applications the company plans to allocate an increasing portion of its manufacturing capacity to support these products and expand its market position in 2006 the company believes that the strategic diversification of its product portfolio will strengthen its ability to allocate manufacturing resources to obtain the highest rate of return 

  

the company makes significant ongoing investments to implement its proprietary product and process technology in its manufacturing facilities in the united states europe and asia to provide semiconductor products with increasing functionality and performance at lower costs the company introduces new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics such as higher data transfer rates reduced package size lower power consumption and increased megapixel count the company generally reduces the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through its advanced product and process technology such as its leadingedge line width process technology and innovative array architecture 

  

in order to maximize returns from investments in research and development “rd” the company develops process technology that effectively reduces production costs and leverages the company’s capital expenditures to be successfully incorporated in customers’ end products the company must offer qualified semiconductor solutions at a time when customers are developing their design specifications for their end products this is especially true for specialty memory products and cmos image sensors which are required to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance well ahead of a planned ramp of production to commercial volumes in addition dram and nand flash products often incorporate highly advanced design and process technologies that are difficult to manufacture the company must make significant investments in rd to expand its product offering and develop its leadingedge product and process technologies 

  

  

results of operations   

 

  

the company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53week period ending on the thursday closest to august 31 the company’s fiscal 2005 and 2003 contained 52 weeks the company’s fiscal 2004 contained 53 weeks 

  

net sales 

  

net sales for 2005 increased by 11 as compared to 2004 primarily due to a 40 increase in megabits of memory sold partially offset by a 24 decrease in the overall average selling price per megabit for the company’s memory products net sales for 2005 also benefited from an increase of approximately 200 million in sales of cmos image sensors the company’s overall megabit production in 2005 increased by 48 as compared to 2004 principally due to a steep ramp in 300mm wafer production and gains in manufacturing efficiencies realized from improvements in product and process technologies the company realized a significant increase in 300mm wafer production in 2005 achieving its initial target of 5000 wafer outs per week in the fourth quarter the company expects that its 300mm wafer production will continue to increase in 2006 the company’s megabit production exceeded megabit sales in 2005 which resulted in an approximate 170 increase in megabit finished goods inventories primarily consisting of ddr and ddr2 products the increase in inventories was largely the result of a slower than previously expected industrywide transition to ddr2 memory products 

  

most of the increase in sales in 2005 as compared to 2004 resulted from sales of the company’s emerging specialty memory products such as pseudostatic ram “psram” and mobile dram products cmos image sensors and nand flash memory the company’s combined revenue from these products was 8119 million in 2005 and quadrupled from 2004 due to large increases in production and strong demand for the company’s offerings in these product groups the company expects that its revenue from these products will continue to grow rapidly in 2006 as it allocates increasing manufacturing resources to these product groups ddr and ddr2 product sales in 2005 increased 12 from 2004 and were 59 of the company’s net sales in 2005 sales of ddr2 products increased to 14 of the company’s net sales in 2005 from 1 of net sales in 2004 the company expects that sales of ddr2 products will continue to increase in 2006 as market demand continues to shift from ddr products to more advanced ddr2 products 

  

net sales for 2004 increased by 42 as compared to 2003 primarily due to a 20 increase in megabits sold and a 16 increase in average per megabit selling prices for the company’s memory products as a result of generally improved market conditions during 2004 the company increased its allocation of manufacturing capacity to specialty memory products and cmos image sensors the shift in product mix contributed to the increase in average per megabit selling prices for 2004 as specialty memory products on average had higher selling prices per megabit than the company’s ddr and ddr2 products the company’s overall megabit production for 2004 increased approximately 23 from 2003 primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies the growth rate in megabit production for 2004 was partially mitigated by the allocation of wafers to cmos image sensors and specialty memory products 

  

gross margin 

  

the company’s gross margin percentage for 2005 declined to 24 as compared to 30 for 2004 this decline in gross margin was primarily due to the 24 decrease in the company’s overall average selling price per megabit of memory and to a lesser extent a shift in product mix from ddr to ddr2 products which had lower margins in 2005 partially offsetting this decline in gross margin from 2005 to 2004 was a reduction in cost of goods sold per megabit and the increase in sales of cmos image sensors specialty memory and nand flash products which had significantly higher margins than ddr and ddr2 products 

  

the company’s overall cost of goods sold per megabit in 2005 declined from 2004 primarily due to manufacturing improvements the company reduced product costs through manufacturing efficiencies achieved from improved product yield and increase in production utilizing the company’s 110nm process technology and 6f² technology the cost per megabit for 

  

  

products manufactured on 300mm wafers decreased significantly in 2005 compared to 2004 as the company continued to increase 300mm wafer production reaching its initial target of 5000 wafer outs per week manufacturing costs per megabit for ddr2 products were higher than the company’s ddr products in 2005 because of ddr2’s relatively larger die size the company expects that per megabit cost reductions in 2006 will continue to be mitigated by shifts in product mix from ddr to ddr2 

  

the company’s gross margin percentage for 2004 improved to 30 from a negative 1 for 2003 primarily due to the 16 increase in average per megabit selling prices and reduced costs per megabit in addition compared to 2003 gross margin for 2004 benefited from relatively higher margins on sales of products purchased from the company’s tech joint venture the company reduced its overall average cost per megabit for 2004 as compared to 2003 through manufacturing efficiencies achieved by improving product yields and continuing its transition to products utilizing 110nm process technology and 6f² technology 

  

inventory writedowns in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the company recorded 3070 million of charges to cost of goods sold in 2003 to write down the carrying values of work in process and finished goods inventories to their estimated market values as these charges were recorded in advance of when inventory subject to the writedown was sold gross margins in the period of sale were higher than they would be absent the effect of the previous writedowns the company did not record any charges for inventory writedowns in 2005 and 2004 costs of goods sold in 2004 were 610 million lower than they otherwise would have been as a result of writedowns in prior periods costs of goods sold in 2003 were 1749 million lower than they otherwise would have been as a result of writedowns in prior periods net of the writedowns in 2003

  

tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd “tech” the company’s tech joint venture supplied approximately 25 30 and 30 of the total megabits of memory produced by the company in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the company generally purchases memory products from tech at prices determined quarterly based on a discount from average selling prices realized by the company for the immediately preceding quarter depending on market conditions the gross margin from the sale of products manufactured by tech may be higher or lower than the gross margin from the sale of products manufactured by the company’s whollyowned operations in 2005 the company realized gross margin percentages on sales of tech products that were approximately the same as for the ddr and ddr2 products manufactured by its whollyowned operations in 2004 and 2003 the company realized higher gross margin percentages on sales of tech products than for products manufactured by its whollyowned operations

  

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for 2005 increased 5 from 2004 primarily due to higher compensation costs partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with legal matters sga expenses for 2004 were 7 lower than for 2003 primarily due to lower costs associated with outstanding legal matters and reduced depreciation costs partially offset by higher levels of performancebased compensation expense and other personnel costs 

  

research and development 

  

rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture its products the company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 

  

rd expenses for 2005 decreased 20 from 2004 principally because products were qualified on the 300mm wafer fabrication process in the first quarter of 2005 when products are qualified the company includes costs from the production of these products in inventory and costs of goods sold rather than research and development expense higher compensation costs partially offset the decreases in rd expenses for 2005 as compared to 2004 rd expenses for 2004 increased 15 from 2003 principally due to an increase in development wafers processed during 2004 as the company increased its product diversification and ramped production at its 300mm wafer fabrication facility which primarily ran development wafers in 2004 higher rd costs in 2004 as compared to 2003 also reflected a higher level of expenses related to cmos image sensors flash memory and specialty memory products 

  

the company’s process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of 95nm 78nm 65nm and smaller dram and 90nm 72nm 50nm and smaller nand flash linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate the company’s transition to next generation products additional rd efforts include process development to support the company’s 300mm 

  

  

wafer manufacturing nand flash memory cmos image sensors specialty memory products including psram mobile sdram and reduced latency dram and new manufacturing materials efforts toward the design and development of new products are concentrated on the company’s 1 gig and 2 gig ddr ddr2 and ddr3 products as well as high density and mobile nand flash memory cmos image sensors and specialty memory products 

  

restructure and other charges 

  

in 2003 the company announced a series of costreduction initiatives the restructure plan included the shutdown of the company’s 200mm production line in virginia the discontinuance of certain memory products including sram and tcam and an approximate 10 reduction in the company’s worldwide workforce in 2003 the company recorded restructure charges of 1092 million and other restructurerelated charges of 71 million including 507 million of equipment writedowns 263 million of severance and other termination benefits and 186 million of intangible asset write downs the company recorded net credits to restructure of 14 million and 225 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively primarily from sales of equipment associated with the company’s 200mm production line in virginia the company substantially completed the restructure plan and paid essentially all costs associated with the restructure plan in 2004 and 2003 

  

stockbased compensation 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r will require the company to use a fairvalue based method of accounting for sharebased compensation beginning in 2006 through 2005 the company used the intrinsicvalue method to account for stockbased compensation and generally no compensation costs were recorded accordingly the company’s implementation of sfas no 123r will increase compensation costs reflected in cost of goods sold sga and rd in the consolidated statement of operations for future periods 

  

in april of 2005 the company accelerated the vesting of approximately 446 million unvested stock options outstanding under the company’s stock plans to reduce compensation costs that would have been recognized in the company’s consolidated financial statements after 2005 with the adoption of sfas 123r by approximately 100 million as of september 1 2005 3 of the company’s then outstanding stock options were unvested and the expense for these unvested stock options to be recorded in 2006 through 2009 is 104 million because the company’s nearterm stockbased compensation costs were reduced by the acceleration of vesting sharebased compensation costs could grow significantly in future periods if the company continues to grant amounts of new sharebased compensation awards similar to recent periods

other operating income for 2005 includes net gains on writedowns and disposals of semiconductor equipment of 127 million and 120 million in receipts from the us government in connection with antidumping tariffs other operating expense for 2004 includes losses of 172 million from changes in currency exchange rates other operating income for 2004 includes 72 million from the commonwealth of virginia for meeting investment commitments at the virginia wafer fabrication facility and net gains of 39 million on writedowns and disposals of semiconductor equipment other operating expense for 2003 includes net losses on writedowns and disposals of semiconductor equipment of 415 million and losses of 107 million from changes in currency exchange rates other operating expense for 2003 is net of 144 million in receipts from the us government in connection with antidumping tariffs the company estimates that based on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than us dollar as of september 1 2005 a 1 change in the exchange rate versus the us dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately 1 million for the yen and 1 million for the euro 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes for 2005 2004 and 2003 primarily reflect taxes on the company’s nonus operations the company has a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax asset associated with its us operations the provision for taxes on us operations in 2005 and 2004 was substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance until such time as the company utilizes its us net operating loss carryforwards and unused tax credits the provision for taxes on the company’s us operations is expected to be substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance as of september 1 2005 the company had aggregate us tax net operating loss carryforwards of 25 billion and unused us tax credit carryforwards of 1407 million the company also has unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of 17 billion and unused state tax credits of 1375 million substantially all of the net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2022 to 2025 and substantially all of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2013 to 2025 

  

  

liquidity and capital resources   

the company’s liquidity is highly dependent on average selling prices for its semiconductor memory products and the timing of capital expenditures both of which can vary significantly from period to period as of september 1 2005 the company had cash and marketable investment securities totaling 12904 million compared to 12310 million as of september 2 2004 

  

operating activities   for 2005 net cash provided by operating activities was 12378 million which principally reflects the company’s 1880 million of net income adjusted by 12645 million for noncash depreciation and amortization expense cash provided by operations was reduced by a 1933 million increase in inventories the increase in inventories was largely the result of a slower than previously expected industrywide transition to ddr2 memory products

  

investing activities   for 2005 net cash used by investing activities was 10839 million which included cash expenditures for property plant and equipment of 10648 million the company believes that to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality it must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies facilities and capital equipment research and development and product and process technologies the company projects 2006 capital spending of 10 billion to 15 billion as of september 1 2005 the company had commitments extending into 2007 of approximately 250 million for the acquisition of property plant and equipment

  

financing activities   for 2005 net cash used by financing activities was 1155 million payments on debt were 3000 million for 2005 and included prepayment of the 2100 million outstanding on the company’s subordinated notes that were due september 2005 payments on equipment purchase contracts were 2360 million for 2005 in the third quarter of 2005 the company obtained an aggregate of 235 billion yen 2214 million from two yendenominated loan financing arrangements that are payable in semiannual installments through 2010 in 2005 the company received 1613 million in proceeds from salesleaseback transactions which are payable in periodic installments through january 2009

  

in 2004 the company received 4500 million from intel in exchange for stock rights exchangeable into approximately 339 million shares of the company’s common stock additionally the company agreed to achieve operational objectives or be subject to monetary penalties the company has achieved operational objectives and does not expect to make any payments to intel under this agreement 

  

access to capital markets has historically been important to the company depending on market conditions the company may from time to time issue registered or unregistered securities to raise capital to fund a portion of its operations 

  

as of september 1 2005 the company had 6325 million of 25 convertible subordinated notes the “notes” outstanding holders of the notes may convert all or some of their notes at any time prior to maturity unless previously redeemed or repurchased into the company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 848320 shares for each 1000 principal amount of the notes this conversion rate is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 1179 per share the company may redeem the notes at any time after february 6 2006 at declining premiums to par 

  

contractual obligations   the following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations at september 1 2005 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the company’s liquidity and cash flows in future periods

  

   

the obligations disclosed above do not include contractual obligations recorded on the company’s balance sheet as current liabilities except for the current portion of longterm debt the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations 

  

  

  

discussed above is estimated based on current information timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services market prices or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

  

purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria 1 they are noncancelable 2 the company would incur a penalty if the agreement was cancelled or 3 the company must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take delivery of the contracted products or services “takeorpay” if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable the entire value of the contract was included in the above table if the obligation is cancelable but the company would incur a penalty if cancelled the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation contracted minimum amounts specified in takeorpay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment 

  

the company has an agreement with its tech joint venture to purchase all of tech’s output of semiconductor memory components subject to specific terms and conditions as the purchase quantities are based on qualified production output the agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity and therefore the company did not include the agreement in its purchase obligations in addition to purchase quantities the tech purchase obligation fluctuates based on average selling prices for semiconductor memory components which can change significantly from period to period in 2005 the net cost of semiconductor components purchased from tech was 6519 million 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements   

as of september 1 2005 the company had the following offbalance sheet arrangements convertible debt call spread options stock warrants and its variable interest in the tech joint venture 

  

see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” for a description of the company’s convertible debt 

  

concurrent with the issuance of the notes the company purchased call spread options the “call spread options” covering 537 million shares of the company’s common stock which is the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the notes in full the call spread options have a lower strike price of 1179 a higher strike price of 1819 may be settled at the company’s option either in cash or net shares and expire on january 29 2008 settlement of the call spread options in cash on january 29 2008 would result in the company receiving an amount ranging from zero if the market price per share of the company’s common stock is at or below 1179 to a maximum of 3434 million if the market price per share of the company’s common stock is at or above 1819 

  

in 2001 the company received 4802 million from the issuance of warrants to purchase 291 million shares of the company’s common stock the warrants entitle the holders to exercise their warrants and purchase shares of common stock for 5600 per share the “exercise price” at any time through may 15 2008 the “expiration date” warrants exercised prior to the expiration date will be settled on a “net share” basis wherein investors receive common stock equal to the difference between 5600 and the average closing sale price for the common shares over the 30 trading days immediately preceding the exercise date at expiration the company may elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis or for cash provided certain conditions are satisfied as of september 1 2005 there had been no exercises of warrants and all warrants issued remained outstanding 

  

see “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data – notes to consolidated financial statements – joint venture” for a description of the company’s arrangement with its tech joint venture 

  

recently issued accounting standards   

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” sfas no 154 replaces apb opinion no 20 “accounting changes” and sfas no 3 “reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements” and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle the company is required to adopt sfas no 154 for accounting changes and error corrections that occur after the beginning of 2007 the company’s results of operations and financial condition will only be impacted following the adoption of sfas no 154 if it implements changes in accounting principle that are addressed by the standard or corrects accounting errors in future periods 

  

  

in march 2005 the fasb issued interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” which clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value can be reasonably estimated even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement the company is required to adopt interpretation no 47 prior to the end of 2006 the company is currently assessing the impact of interpretation no 47 on its results of operations and financial condition 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services or incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s equity instruments focusing primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in sharebased payment transactions sfas no 123r requires public entities to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grantdate fair value of the award with limited exceptions and recognize the cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award in march 2005 the us securities and exchange commission “sec” issued sab 107 which expresses views of the sec staff regarding the application of sfas no 123r among other things sab 107 provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas no 123r and certain sec rules and regulations as well as provides the sec staff’s views regarding the valuation of sharebased payment arrangements for public companies the company is required to adopt sfas no 123r in the beginning of 2006 upon adoption the company will record noncash stock compensation expense primarily associated with future grants of stock options which will have an adverse effect on its results of operations 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets – an amendment of apb opinion no 29” which eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance the company is required to adopt sfas no 153 for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in the first quarter of 2006 and its adoption is not expected to have a significant effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

  

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs – an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage the company is required to adopt sfas no 151 in the beginning of 2006 and its adoption is not expected to have a significant effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

  

critical accounting estimates   

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

  

contingencies   the company is subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date

  

income taxes   the company is required to estimate its provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year the company is also required to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of the company’s performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the company’s ability to generate future taxable income

  

inventories   inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value cost includes labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in

  

  

work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes the company reviews recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analysis of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated market values below the company’s manufacturing costs the company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded due to the volatile nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

  

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories the company’s inventory has been categorized as semiconductor memory products or cmos image sensors the major characteristics the company considers in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 

  

product and process technology   costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by the company are capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over periods currently ranging up to 10 years the company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents filed capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of i the estimated useful life of the technology ii the patent term or iii the term of the technology agreement

  

property plant and equipment the company reviews the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by the company including but not limited to future use of the assets for company operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for the company’s products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required by the company in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed

  

research and development   costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development when incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by the company the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability

  

certain factors   

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 

  

we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our memory products which have adversely affected our business 

  

per megabit average selling prices decreased 24 in 2005 as compared to 2004 in recent years we have also experienced annual decreases in per megabit average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products including 17 in 2003 53 in 2002 60 in 2001 37 in 1999 60 in 1998 and 75 in 1997 at times average selling prices for our semiconductor products have been below our costs if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per megabit costs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

increased worldwide dram production or lack of demand for dram could lead to further declines in average selling prices for dram 

  

the transition to smaller linewidth process technologies and 300mm wafers in the industry could depending upon the rate of transition lead to a significant increase in the worldwide supply of dram increases in worldwide supply of dram also result from dram fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to dram production several of our competitors have announced plans to increase production through construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities increases in worldwide supply of dram 

  

  

if not accompanied with increases in demand could lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

as the computer industry matures and the growth rate of computers sold or growth rate of the amount of semiconductor memory included in each computer decreases sales of our semiconductor products could decrease 

  

we are primarily dependent on the computing market as most of the semiconductor products we sell are used in computers servers or peripheral products approximately 70 of our sales of semiconductor products for 2005 were to the computing market drams are the primary semiconductor memory components in computers throughout most of the 1980s and 1990s industry revenue for the dram market grew at a much faster rate than the overall economy driven by both growth in sales of computers and the amount of memory included in each computer sold however as with any maturing market it is unlikely that historic growth rates for this market will be sustained in recent years the dram market has grown at a significantly slower rate as the computer industry has continued to mature the reduction in the growth rate of computers sold or growth rate of the amount of semiconductor memory included in each computer could reduce sales of our semiconductor products and our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

we may be unable to reduce our per megabit manufacturing costs at the same rate as we have in the past 

  

historically our gross margin has benefited from decreases in per megabit manufacturing costs achieved through improvements in our manufacturing processes including reducing the die size of our existing products in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per megabit manufacturing costs or reduce costs at historical rates due to the ever increasing complexity of manufacturing processes to changes in process technologies or products which inherently may require relatively larger die sizes or to strategic product diversification decisions affecting product mix 

  

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments 

  

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and per megabit manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology facilities and capital equipment research and development and product and process technology in addition to cash provided by operations we have from time to time utilized external sources of financing depending on general market and economic conditions or other factors we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments 

  

the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 

  

we face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag samsung electronics co ltd sandisk corporation and toshiba corporation additionally we face competition from emerging companies in taiwan and china who have announced plans to significantly expand the scale of their operations we face competition in the image sensor market from a number of suppliers of cmos image sensors as well a large number of suppliers of ccd image sensors some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs these factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices 

  

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap and are reported in us dollars across our multinational operations there are transactions and balances denominated in other currencies primarily the yen and euro in the event that the us dollar weakens significantly compared to the yen or euro our results of operations or financial condition will be adversely affected the company estimates that based on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than us dollar as of september 1 2005 a 1 change in the exchange rate versus the us dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately 1 million for the yen and 1 million for the euro 

  

if our tech joint venture experiences financial difficulty or if our supply of semiconductor products from tech is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

  

tech supplied approximately 25 of our total megabits of memory produced in 2005 we have agreements to purchase all of the products manufactured by tech subject to specific terms and conditions in some periods we have realized higher margins on products purchased from tech than products manufactured by our whollyowned facilities any reduction in supply could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition as of september 1 2005 we had intangible assets with a net book value of 503 million relating to the supply arrangement to purchase product from tech in the event that our supply of semiconductor products from tech is reduced or eliminated we may be required to write off part or all of these assets and our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

new product development may be unsuccessful 

  

we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years in particular we have made significant investments in nand flash and cmos image sensor product and process technologies there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture these new products that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will recover costs of development efforts 

  

an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights in this regard we are engaged in litigation with rambus inc “rambus” relating to certain of rambus’ patents and certain of our claims and defenses on august 28 2000 we filed a complaint subsequently amended against rambus in the us district court for the district of delaware seeking monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief among other things our amended complaint alleges violation of federal antitrust laws breach of contract fraud deceptive trade practices and negligent misrepresentation the complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment a that certain rambus patents are not infringed by us are invalid andor are unenforceable b that we have an implied license to those patents and c that rambus is estopped from enforcing those patents against us on february 15 2001 rambus filed an answer and counterclaim in delaware denying that we are entitled to relief alleging infringement of the eight rambus patents named in our declaratory judgment claim and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief a number of other suits are pending in europe alleging that certain of our sdram and ddr sdram products infringe various of rambus’ country counterparts to its european patent 525 068 including on september 1 2000 rambus filed suit against micron semiconductor deutschland gmbh in the district court of mannheim germany on september 13 2000 rambus filed suit against micron europe limited in the high court of justice chancery division in london england on september 22 2000 rambus filed a complaint against us and reptronic a distributor of our products in court of first instance of paris france and on september 29 2000 we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of milan italy alleging invalidity and noninfringement in addition on december 29 2000 we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of avezzano italy alleging invalidity and noninfringement of the italian counterpart to european patent 1 004 956 additionally other suits are pending alleging that certain of our ddr sdram products infringe rambus’ country counterparts to its european patent 1 022 642 including on august 10 2001 rambus filed suit against us and assitec an electronics retailer in the civil court of pavia italy and on august 14 2001 rambus filed suit against micron semiconductor deutschland gmbh in the district court of mannheim germany in the european suits against us rambus is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief subsequent to the filing of the various european suits the european patent office declared rambus’ 525 068 and 1 004 956 european patents invalid and revoked the patents we also are engaged in litigation with tessera inc “tessera” relating to certain of tessera’s patents and certain of our patents on march 1 2005 tessera filed suit against us in the us district court for the eastern district of texas alleging infringement of five tessera patents on june 22 2005 we filed an answer and counterclaim denying tessera’s claims and alleging infringement of eight of our patents we also are engaged in litigation with tadahiro ohmi “ohmi” on june 2 2005 ohmi filed suit against the company in the us district court for the eastern district of texas amended on august 31 2005 alleging infringement of a single ohmi patent 

  

among other things the above lawsuits pertain to certain of our sdram ddrsdram and ddr2 sdram products which account for a significant portion of our net sales a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes we are unable to predict the outcome of assertions of infringement made against the company any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

  

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

  

allegations of anticompetitive conduct 

  

on june 17 2002 we received a grand jury subpoena from the us district court for the northern district of california seeking information regarding an investigation by the antitrust division of the department of justice the “doj” into possible antitrust violations in the “dynamic random access memory” or “dram” industry we are cooperating fully and actively with the doj in its investigation of the dram industry our cooperation is pursuant to the terms of the doj’s corporate leniency policy which provides that in exchange for our full continuing and complete cooperation in the pending investigation we will not be subject to prosecution fines or other penalties from the doj 

  

subsequent to the commencement of the doj investigation a number of purported class action lawsuits have been filed against us and other dram suppliers eighteen cases have been filed in various federal district courts one of which has been voluntarily dismissed asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that purchased dram directly from various dram suppliers during the period from april 1 1999 through at least june 30 2002 all of the cases have been transferred to the us district court for the northern district of california for consolidated proceedings the complaints allege pricefixing in violation of federal antitrust laws and seek treble monetary damages costs attorneys’ fees and an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct additionally four cases have been filed in the us district court for the northern district of california asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of individuals and entities that indirectly purchased dram andor products containing dram from various dram suppliers during the time period from april 1 1999 through at least june 30 2002 the complaints allege price fixing in violation of federal antitrust laws and various state antitrust and unfair competition laws and seek treble monetary damages restitution costs interest and attorneys’ fees in addition at least sixtyone cases have been filed in various state and federal courts three of which have been voluntarily dismissed asserting claims on behalf of a purported class of indirect purchasers of dram cases have been filed in the following states arkansas arizona california florida hawaii iowa kansas massachusetts maine michigan minnesota mississippi montana north carolina north dakota nebraska new hampshire new jersey new mexico nevada new york ohio pennsylvania south dakota tennessee utah vermont virginia wisconsin and west virginia and also in the district of columbia and puerto rico the complaints purport to be on behalf of individuals and entities that indirectly purchased dram andor products containing dram in the respective jurisdictions during various time periods ranging from 1999 through the filing date of the various complaints the complaints allege violations of various jurisdictions’ antitrust consumer protection andor unfair competition laws relating to the sale and pricing of dram products and seek treble monetary damages restitution costs interest and attorneys’ fees a number of these cases have been removed to federal court and transferred to the us district court for the northern district of california san francisco for consolidated proceedings additionally three cases have been filed in the following canadian courts superior court district of montreal province of quebec ontario superior court of justice ontario and supreme court of british columbia vancouver registry british columbia the substantive allegations in these cases are similar to those asserted in the cases filed in the united states based upon our analysis of the claims made and the nature of the dram industry we believe that class treatment of these cases is not appropriate and that any purported injury alleged by plaintiffs in the direct purchaser cases would be more appropriately resolved on a customerbycustomer basis in addition the attorneys general of arkansas california colorado delaware florida hawaii idaho illinois iowa louisiana maryland mississippi nevada new jersey new mexico new york ohio oklahoma oregon pennsylvania south carolina texas utah vermont virginia washington west virginia and wisconsin have indicated that they are investigating potential state and federal civil claims against us and other dram suppliers on behalf of state and governmental entities that were direct or indirect purchasers of dram and potentially on behalf of other indirect purchasers of dram we are unable to predict the outcome of these lawsuits and investigations the final resolution of these alleged violations of antitrust laws could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

on may 5 2004 rambus filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county against us and other dram suppliers the complaint alleges various causes of action under california state law including conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices on rambus dram “rdram” and unfair competition tessera also has asserted certain antitrust and unfair competition claims relating to tessera’s packaging technology these complaints seek treble damages punitive damages attorneys’ fees costs and a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaints we are unable to predict the outcome of the suit a court determination against us could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

current economic and political conditions may harm our business 

  

global economic conditions and the effects of military or terrorist actions may cause significant disruptions to worldwide commerce if these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders a decrease in corporate spending on 

  

  

information technology or our inability to effectively market manufacture or ship our products our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

sales to customers outside the united states approximated 66 of our consolidated net sales for 2005 in addition we have manufacturing operations in italy japan puerto rico scotland and singapore our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

  

•   currency exchange rate fluctuations

  

•   export and import duties changes to import and export regulations and restrictions on the transfer of funds

  

•   political and economic instability

  

•   problems with the transportation or delivery of our products

  

•   issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest

  

•   longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and

  

•   compliance with trade and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions

  

these factors may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

if our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process or the effects from a shift in product mix can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per megabit manufacturing costs from time to time we have experienced minor disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages or equipment failures if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers’ requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

disruptions in our supply of raw materials could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future in addition disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses if despite design review quality control and product qualification procedures problems with nonconforming defective or 

  

  

incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products we could be adversely affected in several ways including the following 

  

•   we may replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product and

  

•   we may encounter adverse publicity which could cause a decrease in sales of our products

  

we expect to make future acquisitions where advisable which involve numerous risks 

  

we expect to make future acquisitions where we believe it is advisable to enhance shareholder value acquisitions involve numerous risks including 

  

•   increasing our exposure to changes in average selling prices for semiconductor products

  

•   difficulties in integrating the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies

  

•   increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities

  

•   increasing debt to finance any acquisition

  

•   diverting management’s attention from normal daily operations

  

•   managing larger operations and facilities and employees in separate geographic areas and

  

•   hiring and retaining key employees

  

mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and future acquisitions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition

flash memory   flash products are electrically rewriteable nonvolatile semiconductor devices that retain memory content when power is turned off flash memory is used in networking applications workstations servers personal computers and handheld electronic devices such as digital cellular phones digital still cameras and digital music players there are two primary types of flash memory nor flash and nand flash nor flash has a random access interface to data that enables fast read speeds making it ideal for storage of program code that needs to be infrequently updated nand flash only allows sequential access to data which reduces read time for some applications but offers faster erase and write times higher density and lower cost per bit than nor flash in addition nand flash has significantly increased cycle endurance making it ideal for massstorage devices

  

through 2004 the company’s commercial flash memory offerings consisted solely of norbased products the company’s future plans for flash memory are focused on nand flash which uses semiconductor technology similar to dram the market for nand flash products has grown rapidly and is expected to continue to grow rapidly due to demand for removable and embedded storage devices removable storage devices such as usb and flash memory cards are used with applications such as personal computers digital still cameras mp3 players and mobile phones embedded nandbased storage devices are also beginning to be utilized in mobile phones in addition to or in lieu of norbased flash storage the 

  

  

company has been developing nand flash products and expects to begin shipping commercial volumes of its 2 gig nand flash products in 2005 

  

the company plans to leverage its dram product and process technologies to compete in the nand flash memory market the company’s nand flash designs feature a small cell structure that enables higher densities for demanding applications to compete in the nand flash market the company must successfully introduce new products rapidly ramp production of products to commercial volumes and manufacture products costefficiently 

  

complementary metaloxide semiconductor “cmos” image sensors   cmos image sensors are semiconductor devices that capture and process images into pictures or video for a variety of consumer and industrial applications the company’s cmos image sensors are used in products such as cellular phone cameras digital still cameras pill cameras for medical use automotive and other emerging applications the company offers image sensors in a range of pixel resolutions from its vga video graphics array products to its higherend 31 megapixel products image sensors are sold either as individual components or combined with integrated circuitry to create complete camera systemonachip “soc” solutions in 2004 the company’s primary image sensor product was a vga soc sensor the company began shipping commercial volumes of its higher resolution 13 megapixel 20 megapixel and 31 megapixel image sensors in 2004

  

the company’s cmos image sensors incorporating its digitalclarity™ technology have many advantages over other cmos image sensors and chargecoupled device “ccd” sensors which have dominated the image sensor market until recent periods unlike ccd sensors which rely on specialized fabrication requiring dedicated and costly manufacturing processes cmos image sensors can be manufactured using standardized semiconductor processes resulting in substantially lower costs the company’s lowleakage dram processes are particularly well suited for the manufacture of cmos image sensors the company’s cmos image sensors employ an “activepixel” design architecture that enables them to achieve performance comparable to highend ccd devices and higher than competitor’s cmos image sensors the company’s cmos image sensors consume substantially less power than ccd devices a critical advantage in the batterydependent portable device applications where most image sensors are used the market for image sensors is expected to increase significantly over the next several years due to the growth forecasted for applications such as phone cameras and digital still cameras 

  

manufacturing   

the company’s manufacturing facilities are located in the united states italy japan puerto rico scotland and singapore the company’s manufacturing facilities operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week 

  

the company’s process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex involving a number of precise steps including wafer fabrication assembly burnin and final test efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities the primary determinants of manufacturing cost are die size number of mask layers number of fabrication steps and number of acceptable die produced on each wafer other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment equipment utilization process complexity cost of raw materials labor productivity package type and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment the company is continuously enhancing production processes reducing die sizes and transitioning to higher density products in 2004 the company substantially completed the migration of its manufacturing operations to its 110 nanometer “nm” linewidth process technology the company expects to begin transitioning its manufacturing operations to 95nm linewidth process technology in 2005 

  

wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and qualitylimiting contaminants despite stringent manufacturing controls dust particles equipment errors minute impurities in materials defects in photomasks and circuit design marginalities or other problems cause wafers to be scrapped or individual circuits to be nonfunctional success of the company’s manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and thereby maximizing yield of highquality circuits in this regard the company employs rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing screening and testing processes the company is able to recover many nonstandard devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality 

  

after fabrication silicon wafers are separated into individual die functional die are sorted connected to external leads and encapsulated in plastic packages the company assembles products in a variety of packages including tsop thin small outline package tqfp thin quad flat package and fbga fine pitch ball grid array each completed package is then inspected and tested the company also sells semiconductor products in unpackaged die form the company tests its products at various stages in the manufacturing process performs high temperature burnin on finished products and conducts numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow in addition the company uses its proprietary 

  

  

ambyx™ line of intelligent test and burnin systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of dram die during the burnin process capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost 

  

a significant portion of the company’s memory products are assembled into memory modules for sale to customers memory modules consist of an array of memory components attached to printed circuit boards “pcbs” that connect to computer systems or other electronic devices memory components are attached to pcbs in a soldering process performed by screen printing machines and high speed automated pick and place machines completed modules are tested by custom equipment and visually inspected 

  

in 2004 the company qualified its first product at its 300mm wafer fabrication plant in virginia the 512 meg ddr device was produced on the company’s 110nm process technology and is the industry’s first memory device in production to utilize copper interconnects the company is ramping production at the virginia wafer fabrication facility as of the end of 2004 production at the virginia facility had not reached levels necessary to achieve mature product yield and costefficient utilization of the facility the company is assessing which of its other facilities will be converted to 300mm wafer fabrication and when those facilities will be converted 

  

tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd “tech” tech is a memory manufacturing joint venture in singapore among micron technology inc the singapore economic development board canon inc and hewlettpackard company tech’s semiconductor manufacturing facilities use the company’s product and process technology subject to specific terms and conditions the company has agreed to purchase all of the products manufactured by tech tech supplied approximately 30 30 and 20 of the total megabits of memory produced by the company in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the company generally purchases semiconductor memory products from tech at prices determined quarterly based on a discount from average selling prices realized by the company for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter the company performs assembly and test services on product manufactured by tech the company also provides certain technology engineering and training to support tech all of these transactions with tech are recognized as part of the net cost of products purchased from tech

  

availability of raw materials   

the company’s production processes require raw materials that meet exacting standards including several that are customized for or unique to the company the company generally has multiple sources of supply however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet the company’s standards various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases lead frames molding compound and other materials in addition any transportation problems could delay the company’s receipt of raw materials although raw materials shortages or transportation problems have not interrupted the company’s operations in the past shortages may occur from time to time in the future also lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if the company’s supply of raw materials is interrupted or lead times are extended results of operations could be adversely affected 

  

marketing and customers   

the company’s products are sold into computing and consumer networking and telecommunications and imaging markets approximately 75 of the company’s net sales for 2004 were to the computing market sales to both dell computer corporation and hewlettpackard company exceeded 10 of the company’s net sales in 2004 2003 and 2002 and aggregated 27 28 and 28 of the company’s net sales in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

the company markets its semiconductor products primarily through its own direct sales force the company maintains inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of product shipments the company’s products are also offered through independent sales representatives distributors and crucial technology the company’s webbased customer direct sales division the company’s products are offered under the micron spectek and crucial brand names and under other private labels the company maintains sales offices in all of its primary markets around the world independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by the company and are compensated on a commission basis the company makes shipments against these orders directly to the customer distributors carry the company’s products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products including competitors’ products 

  

segmentation of the dram market continues with diverse memory needs being driven by the different requirements of desktop and notebook personal computers servers workstations handheld devices and communications industrial and other applications that demand specific memory solutions many of the company’s customers require a thorough review or 

  

  

qualification of semiconductor products which may take several months as the company further diversifies its product lines and reduces the die sizes of existing memory products more products become subject to qualification which may delay volume introduction of specific devices by the company 

  

backlog   

volatile industry conditions make customers reluctant to enter into longterm fixedprice contracts accordingly new order volumes for the company’s semiconductor products fluctuate significantly orders are typically accepted with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment customers can change delivery schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty for these reasons the company does not believe that its order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 

  

product warranty   

because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex it is possible that the company may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses in accordance with industry practice the company generally provides a limited warranty that its products are in compliance with company specifications existing at the time of delivery under the company’s general terms and conditions of sale liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of or a credit with respect to amounts paid for such items under certain circumstances the company may provide more extensive limited warranty coverage and general legal principles may impose more extensive liability than that provided under the company’s general terms and conditions 

  

competition   

the company faces intense competition from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag and samsung electronics co ltd additionally the company faces competition from emerging companies in taiwan and china who have announced plans to significantly expand the scale of their operations some of the company’s competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which the company competes invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities the company’s competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs these factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices 

  

historically various governments have provided economic assistance to international competitors which has enabled or artificially supported competitors’ production of semiconductor memory particularly dram this factor may continue to affect the supply of dram and other semiconductor products in future periods 

  

research and development   

to compete in the semiconductor memory industry the company must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes the company believes that expansion of its semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions the company has several product design centers around the world the largest located at its corporate headquarters in boise idaho in addition the company has a facility at its boise site to develop leading edge photolithography mask technology 

  

rd expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture the company’s products the company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability and is internally qualified for sale to customers rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification product development costs are recorded as rd expense the company’s rd expenses were 7549 million 6564 million and 5613 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

  

the company’s process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of 95nm and 78nm and smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate the company’s transition to next generation products additional rd efforts include process development to support the company’s 300mm wafer manufacturing cmos image sensors flash memory specialty memory products including psram and rldram and new memory manufacturing materials efforts toward the design and development of new products are concentrated on the company’s 512 meg and 1 gig ddr ddr2 and ddr3 dram products as well as nand flash memory cmos image sensors and specialty memory products

overview   

the company is a global manufacturer and marketer of semiconductor memory devices principally dram and flash and cmos image sensor devices its products are used in a broad range of electronic applications including personal computers workstations servers cell phones digital still cameras and other consumer and industrial products the company’s customers are principally original equipment manufacturers and memory module retailers located around the globe 

  

the markets for the company’s products behave in a manner similar to commodity markets as the products are generally standardized with selling prices that fluctuate based on industrywide relationships of supply and demand enhancing operating results and strengthening financial condition in these types of markets is likely dependent upon leading the industry in low cost production capital efficiency and return on research and development investments historically the semiconductor memory market has been subject to subsidization thereby leading to the entry of new competitors and at times excess supply 

  

the company’s proprietary product and process technology allows sophisticated semiconductor memory and imaging devices to be manufactured with progressively smaller die sizes historically the company has been able to reduce the cost of its memory products by implementing new product and process technologies these new technologies enable the company to produce more megabits of memory on each wafer primarily by reducing the size of the circuits “shrinking” that make up each memory cell in 2004 the company introduced products featuring its 6f² hypershrink™ array architecture technology that enables it to further increase megabits produced per wafer this 6f² technology reduces the size of memory cells approximately 20 from industry standard 8f² products without significant additional investment in equipment the company continually introduces new generations of products that offer lower costs per megabit and improved performance characteristics such as higher data transfer rates reduced package size per megabit and lower power consumption 

  

the company has made substantial investments in its manufacturing facilities in the united states europe and asia a significant portion of semiconductor manufacturing equipment is replaced every three to five years with more advanced equipment to process leading edge technology and reduce cost per part because the company owns most of its manufacturing capacity a significant portion of the company’s operating costs are fixed in general these costs do not vary with changes in the company’s utilization of its manufacturing capacity and accordingly margins fluctuate with utilization the company must generate sufficient cash flow from operations for reinvestment in manufacturing capability or obtain external financing historically the company has accessed external markets to fund a portion of its cash requirements 

  

maximizing returns from investments in research and development “rd” is dependent on developing process technology that effectively reduces production costs leveraging required investments across a substantial scale of production and designing new products that can be successfully brought to market the company must invest heavily in rd to expand its product offering and enable development of leadingedge product and process technologies the company has made significant rd investments in recent periods to develop products that will enable it to enter new markets 

  

  

in recent years approximately 80 of the company’s products were sold into computer and computer peripheral markets the computing market for a number of decades has had an extremely high growth rate as with any maturing market it is likely that future growth rates will more closely parallel broader macroeconomic trends 

  

the company is strategically diversifying its business into semiconductor products other than core dram the company’s noncore dram products include specialty memory flash memory and cmos image sensors these products leverage the company’s competencies in semiconductor memory manufacturing and product and process technology noncore dram products are typically of lower density and are manufactured in lower volumes than core dram and allow the company to use prior generation processes and equipment unlike core dram these products are typically used in electronic devices other than computers and in many cases the company can differentiate them from competitor’s products based on performance characteristics 

  

markets for some of the company’s nondram products are expected to grow rapidly in particular the markets for nand flash and cmos image sensors the company believes that its product and process technology and manufacturing competencies position it well to compete in these markets accordingly the company plans to allocate an increasing portion of its manufacturing capacity to these products in 2005 success in these markets is dependent in part on the company’s ability to timely develop new products that are well received by customers and gain sufficient market share 

  

results of operations   

 

  

the company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53week period ending on the thursday closest to august 31 the company’s fiscal 2004 contained 53 weeks 

  

net sales 

  

net sales for 2004 increased by 42 as compared to 2003 primarily due to a 20 increase in megabits sold and a 16 increase in average per megabit selling prices for the company’s memory products as a result of generally improved market conditions during 2004 the company increased its allocation of manufacturing capacity to specialty memory products including pseudostatic ram “psram” cmos image sensors and legacy dram products the shift in product mix contributed to the increase in average per megabit selling prices for 2004 as specialty memory products and legacy dram products on average had higher selling prices per megabit than the company’s core dram products the company’s overall megabit production for 2004 increased approximately 23 from 2003 primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies the growth rate in megabit production for 2004 was constrained in part by the allocation of wafers to cmos image sensors specialty memory products and legacy dram products which do not require leading edge process technology and therefore inherently have a lower production growth rate than the company’s advanced core dram products megabit output per wafer is also lower for specialty memory and legacy dram products because of their relatively lower density and greater complexity further the company’s diversification of product mix and prioritization of specialty memory products necessitated production changes to optimize longterm wafer process efficiency that resulted in a temporary reduction of wafer output in 2004 ddr products constituted 57 of the company’s net sales for both 2004 and 2003 and 20 of net sales in 2002 for 2004 megabit production was slightly higher than megabit sales finished goods inventories at the end of 2004 remained at relatively low levels 

  

the company expects to achieve significant growth in megabit production during 2005 from manufacturing efficiencies and increased wafer output resulting from the production ramp of its 300mm wafer fabrication facility growth in future megabit production over the next several quarters however is expected to be adversely affected by an increased allocation of wafers to the manufacture of ddr2 products which have a relatively larger die size cmos image sensors specialty memory products and flash memory 

  

  

net sales for 2003 increased by 19 as compared to 2002 primarily due to a 44 increase in megabits of memory sold this increase was partially offset by a 17 decrease in average selling prices in 2003 as compared to 2002 for the company’s semiconductor memory products megabits produced increased 43 in 2003 as compared to 2002 principally due to manufacturing efficiencies 

  

gross margin 

  

the company’s reported gross margin percentage for 2004 increased to 30 from a negative 1 for 2003 primarily due to the 16 increase in average per megabit selling prices and reduced costs per megabit in addition compared to 2003 reported gross margin for 2004 benefited from relatively higher margins on sales of products purchased from the company’s tech joint venture the company reduced its overall average cost per megabit for 2004 as compared to 2003 through manufacturing efficiencies achieved by improving product yields and continuing its transition to products utilizing 110nm process technology and 6f² technology the company’s 6f² technology enables it to produce approximately 20 more potential die per wafer than standard products which use 8f² technology per megabit cost reductions in the near term will be limited by the effects of increased production of ddr2 products and specialty memory products but the company expects that average selling prices per megabit for these products will be higher than its primary ddr product per megabit cost reductions will also be limited by higher costs associated with the limited volumes of production at the company’s 300mm manufacturing facility in virginia 

  

the company’s reported gross margin for 2003 improved as compared to 2002 primarily due to a decrease in per megabit manufacturing costs partially offset by the 17 decrease in average selling prices for the company’s semiconductor products and the net effects of inventory writedowns the company was able to significantly reduce per megabit manufacturing costs in 2003 through improvements in manufacturing efficiencies during 2003 the company completed its migration to 130nm process technology and continued to transition to 110nm technology 

  

inventory writedowns the company records charges to cost of goods sold in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to write down the carrying values of work in process and finished goods inventories when they exceed their estimated market values the inventory writedowns reflect estimates of future market pricing relative to the costs of production and inventory carrying values and projected timing of product sales many of the company’s semiconductor components have characteristics similar to commodities that are generally standardized products with selling prices that fluctuate significantly based on industrywide relationships of supply and demand in recent years a combination of global economic conditions and a slowing growth rate in demand for personal computers coupled with worldwide increases in semiconductor production capacity caused significant declines in average selling prices for semiconductor components in all quarters of fiscal 2002 and 2003 market values of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories at a quarter end date were below the company’s manufacturing cost of these products and the company recognized a charge to cost of goods sold to write down the carrying value of inventories to their estimated market values as such charges are recorded in advance of when inventory subject to the writedown is sold gross margins in the period of sale are higher than they would be absent the effect of the previous writedowns no writedown was necessary for 2004 and as of september 2 2004 only a de minimis amount of previous writedowns remains in ending inventory as a result writedowns of inventories prior to 2004 will not have a significant effect on operating results in future periods

  

the following table sets forth adjusted gross margins absent the inventory writedowns and the estimated effect of previous writedowns these writedowns may not be infrequent or nonrecurring in nature but are a result of significant marketdriven declines in average selling prices the presentation of these adjusted amounts vary from numbers presented in accordance with us gaap and therefore may not be comparable to amounts reported by other companies however the company believes this information is significant to understanding the company’s gross margins and analyzing the company’s gross margin trends this nongaap information is important to analyzing the company’s cost of goods sold since the effect of inventory writedowns must be separated from the manufacturing cost component in order to have a reasonable basis for understanding trends in cost of goods sold when evaluating performance and making decisions on how to allocate company resources management uses this nongaap data and believes investors should have access to similar data when making their investment decisions 

  

   

  

“inventory writedowns” are calculated based on estimates of future market pricing relative to the company’s costs of production and inventory carrying values and the projected timing of product sales the reduction in cost of goods sold resulting from sales of writtendown inventory is reflected as the “estimated effect of previous writedowns” in the table above the estimated effect of previous writedowns is calculated by computing cost of goods sold for each applicable period as if no writedowns had been recorded and comparing it to cost of goods sold as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in calculating the estimated effect of previous writedowns the company uses the same judgments and estimates that are used to calculate cost of goods sold 

  

tech semiconductor singapore pte ltd “tech” the tech joint venture supplied approximately 30 30 and 20 of the total megabits of memory produced by the company in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the company generally purchases memory products from tech at prices determined quarterly based on a discount from average selling prices realized by the company for the immediately preceding quarter depending on market conditions the gross margin from the sale of tech products may be higher or lower than the gross margin from the sale of products manufactured by the company’s whollyowned operations in 2004 2003 and 2002 the company realized higher gross margin percentages on sales of tech products than for products manufactured by its whollyowned operations

  

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for 2004 were 7 lower than for 2003 primarily due to lower costs associated with outstanding legal matters and reduced depreciation costs partially offset by higher levels of performancebased compensation expense and other personnel costs selling general and administrative “sga” expenses for 2003 were 8 higher than for 2002 primarily due to higher costs associated with outstanding legal matters sga expenses for the first quarter of 2005 are expected to approximate 90 million 

  

research and development 

  

research and development “rd” expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development and personnel costs because of the lead times necessary to manufacture the company’s products the company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability rd expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification 

  

rd expenses for 2004 increased 15 from 2003 principally due to an increase in development wafers processed during 2004 as the company increased its product diversification and ramped production at its 300mm wafer fabrication facility which primarily ran development wafers in 2004 higher rd costs in 2004 also reflect a higher level of expenses related to cmos image sensors flash memory and specialty memory products rd expenses for 2003 increased 17 from 2002 primarily due to an increase in development wafers processed as the company expanded its product development efforts and began ramping production of 300mm development wafers rd expenses for the first quarter of 2005 are expected to approximate 175 million 

  

the company’s process technology rd efforts are focused primarily on development of 95nm 78nm and smaller linewidth process technologies which are designed to facilitate the company’s transition to next generation products additional rd efforts include process development to support the company’s 300mm wafer manufacturing cmos image sensors flash memory specialty memory products including psram and reduced latency dram “rldram” and new manufacturing materials efforts toward the design and development of new products are concentrated on the company’s 512 meg and 1 gig ddr ddr2 and ddr3 dram products as well as nand flash memory cmos image sensors and specialty memory products 

  

restructure and other charges 

  

in the second quarter of 2003 the company announced a plan to restructure its operations the restructure plan included the shutdown of the company’s 200mm production line in virginia the discontinuance of certain memory products including sram and tcam products and an approximate 10 reduction of the company’s worldwide workforce in connection with the plan the company recorded 1092 million of restructure charges and additional restructurerelated charges of 71 million which are included in cost of goods sold for 2003 the credit to restructure in 2004 primarily reflects gains on sales of equipment associated with operations shut down in the restructure the generally higher equipment sales prices reflect improved market conditions across the semiconductor industry the company has substantially completed the restructure plan as of august 28 2003 the company’s accounts payable and accrued expenses included 31 million for remaining costs 

  

  

accrued in connection with the restructure plan through september 2 2004 the company had paid essentially all of the severance and other termination benefits and other costs incurred in connection with the restructure plan the components of the restructure charge and additional restructure related charges were as follows

other operating expense for 2004 includes losses of 172 million from changes in currency exchange rates other operating income for 2004 includes 72 million from the commonwealth of virginia for meeting investment commitments at the virginia wafer fabrication facility and net gains of 39 million on writedowns and disposals of semiconductor equipment other operating expense for 2003 includes net losses on writedowns and disposals of semiconductor equipment of 415 million and losses of 107 million from changes in currency exchange rates other operating expense for 2003 is net of 144 million in receipts from the us government in connection with antidumping tariffs other operating expense for 2002 includes net losses on writedowns and disposals of semiconductor equipment of 273 million 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes for 2004 2003 and 2002 primarily reflect taxes on the company’s nonus operations us operating results are not expected to reflect an income tax provision until such time as the company utilizes a substantial portion of its us net operating loss carryforwards and unused tax credits as any such provision is substantially offset by a corresponding reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance as of september 2 2004 the company had aggregate us tax net operating loss carryforwards of 28 billion and unused us tax credits of 1067 million which expire through 2024 the company also has unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of 17 billion for tax purposes which expire through 2024 and unused state tax credits of 1239 million for tax and financial reporting purposes which expire through 2018 

  

liquidity and capital resources   

the company’s liquidity is highly dependent on average selling prices for its semiconductor memory products and the timing of capital expenditures both of which can vary significantly from period to period as of september 2 2004 the company had cash and marketable investments totaling 12310 million compared to 9218 million as of august 28 2003 

  

operating activities   for 2004 net cash provided by operating activities was 11588 million primarily reflecting improved average selling prices for semiconductor memory products cash generated from operations in 2004 principally reflects the company’s 1572 million of income adjusted by 12175 million for noncash depreciation and amortization expense partially offset by a 1605 million increase in inventories consisting primarily of work in process inventories resulting from transitions in the company’s product mix and a 1309 million increase in accounts receivable associated with the company’s higher level of sales

  

investing activities   for 2004 net cash used by investing activities was 13127 million including expenditures for property plant and equipment of 10807 million the company believes that to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality it must continue to invest in manufacturing technology facilities and capital equipment research and development and product and process technology the company expects 2005 capital spending to approximate 15 billion as of september 2 2004 the company had commitments extending into 2006 of approximately 360 million for the acquisition of property plant and equipment

  

  

financing activities   for 2004 net cash provided by financing activities was 697 million including 450 million received from intel corporation “intel” payments on equipment purchase contracts and debt were 4506 million for 2004 in 2004 the company received 1011 million in net proceeds from the issuance of notes payable and salesleaseback transactions in the first quarter of 2004 the company paid 675 million to toshiba corporation to redeem the 15 million shares of common stock issued in connection with the acquisition of the company’s virginia facility from toshiba

  

in the first quarter of 2004 the company received 450 million from intel in exchange for the issuance of stock rights exchangeable into approximately 339 million shares of the company’s common stock in conjunction with the issuance of the stock rights the company agreed to achieve operational objectives through may 2005 including certain levels of ddr2 production and 300mm wafer processing capacity in the event the company fails to achieve certain 2005 milestones and the company’s common stock price is then below intel’s per share purchase price of 1329 the company could be obligated to pay intel amounts not to exceed 135 million a substantial portion of which is payable at the company’s election in the company’s common stock 

  

in the second quarter of 2003 the company issued 6325 million of 25 convertible subordinated notes the “notes” holders of the notes may convert all or some of their notes at any time prior to maturity unless previously redeemed or repurchased into the company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 848320 shares for each 1000 principal amount of the notes this conversion rate is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately 1179 per share the company may redeem the notes at any time after february 6 2006 at declining premiums to par 

  

concurrent with the issuance of the notes the company purchased call spread options the “call spread options” covering 537 million shares of the company’s common stock which is the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the notes in full the call spread options have a lower strike price of 1179 a higher strike price of 1819 may be settled at the company’s option either in cash or net shares and expire on january 29 2008 settlement of the call spread options in cash on january 29 2008 would result in the company receiving an amount ranging from zero if the market price per share of the company’s common stock is at or below 1179 to a maximum of 3434 million if the market price per share of the company’s common stock is at or above 1819 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2001 the company received 4802 million from the issuance of warrants to purchase 291 million shares of the company’s common stock the warrants entitle the holders to exercise their warrants and purchase shares of common stock for 5600 per share the “exercise price” at any time through may 15 2008 the “expiration date” warrants exercised prior to the expiration date will be settled on a “net share” basis wherein investors receive common stock equal to the difference between 5600 and the average closing sale price for the common shares over the 30 trading days immediately preceding the exercise date at expiration the company may elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis or for cash provided certain conditions are satisfied as of september 2 2004 there have been no exercises of warrants and all warrants issued remain outstanding 

  

access to capital markets has historically been important to the company depending on market conditions the company may from time to time issue registered or unregistered securities to raise capital to fund a portion of its operations 

  

contractual obligations   the following table summarizes the company’s significant contractual obligations at september 2 2004 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the company’s liquidity and cash flows in future periods

  

   

the obligations disclosed above do not include contractual obligations recorded on the company’s balance sheet as current liabilities except for the current portion of longterm debt the expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services market prices or changes to agreedupon amounts for some obligations 

  

  

purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria 1 they are noncancelable 2 the company would incur a penalty if the agreement was cancelled or 3 the company must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take delivery of the contracted products or services “takeorpay” if the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable the entire value of the contract was included in the above table if the obligation is cancelable but the company would incur a penalty if cancelled the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation contracted minimum amounts specified in takeorpay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment 

  

the company has an agreement with its tech joint venture to purchase all of tech’s output of semiconductor memory components subject to specific terms and conditions as the purchase quantities are based on qualified production output the agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity and therefore the company did not include the agreement in its purchase obligations in addition to purchase quantities the tech purchase obligation fluctuates based on average selling prices for semiconductor memory components which can change significantly from period to period in 2004 the net cost of semiconductor components purchased from tech was 4538 million 

  

recently issued accounting standards   

in december 2003 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued a revised interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities – an interpretation of arb no 51” which provides guidance on the identification of and reporting for variable interest entities the company adopted interpretation no 46 in the third quarter of 2004 adoption of interpretation no 46 did not have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

  

critical accounting policies   

the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and related disclosures estimates and judgments are based on historical experience forecasted future events and various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances estimates and judgments may vary under different assumptions or conditions the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis management believes the accounting policies below are critical in the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 

  

contingencies   the company is subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the company accrues a liability and charges operations for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date

  

income taxes   the company is required to estimate its provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year the company is also required to evaluate the realizability of its deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis in accordance with us gaap which requires the assessment of the company’s performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets realizability of deferred tax assets is dependent on the company’s ability to generate future taxable income

  

inventories   inventories are stated at the lower of average cost or market value cost includes labor material and overhead costs including product and process technology costs determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories to project average selling prices and sales volumes the company reviews recent sales volumes existing customer orders current contract prices industry analysis of supply and demand seasonal factors general economic trends and other information when these analyses reflect estimated market values below the company’s manufacturing costs the company records a charge to cost of goods sold in advance of when the inventory is actually sold differences in forecasted average selling prices used in calculating lower of cost or market adjustments can result in significant changes in the estimated net realizable value of product inventories and accordingly the amount of writedown recorded due to the volatile

  

  

nature of the semiconductor memory industry actual selling prices and volumes often vary significantly from projected prices and volumes and as a result the timing of when product costs are charged to operations can vary significantly 

  

us gaap provides for products to be grouped into categories in order to compare costs to market values the amount of any inventory writedown can vary significantly depending on the determination of inventory categories the company’s inventory has been categorized as semiconductor memory products or cmos image sensors the major characteristics the company considers in determining inventory categories are product type and markets 

  

product and process technology   costs incurred to acquire product and process technology or to patent technology developed by the company are capitalized and amortized on a straightline basis over periods currently ranging up to 10 years the company capitalizes a portion of costs incurred based on its analysis of historical and projected patents issued as a percent of patents filed capitalized product and process technology costs are amortized over the shorter of i the estimated useful life of the technology ii the patent term or iii the term of the technology agreement

  

property plant and equipment the company reviews the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use andor disposition in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets the estimation of future cash flows involves numerous assumptions which require judgment by the company including but not limited to future use of the assets for company operations versus sale or disposal of the assets future selling prices for the company’s products and future production and sales volumes in addition judgment is required by the company in determining the groups of assets for which impairment tests are separately performed

  

research and development   costs related to the conceptual formulation and design of products and processes are expensed as research and development when incurred determining when product development is complete requires judgment by the company the company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability

  

certain factors   

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this form 10k the following are important factors which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 

  

we have experienced dramatic declines in average selling prices for our memory products which have adversely affected our business 

  

in several recent years we experienced annual decreases in per megabit average selling prices for our semiconductor memory products including 17 in 2003 53 in 2002 60 in 2001 37 in 1999 60 in 1998 and 75 in 1997 at times average selling prices for our semiconductor products have been below our costs if average selling prices for our memory products decrease faster than we can decrease per megabit costs our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

increased worldwide dram production or lack of demand for dram could lead to further declines in average selling prices for dram 

  

the transition to smaller linewidth process technologies and 300mm wafers in the industry could depending upon the rate of transition lead to a significant increase in the worldwide supply of dram increases in worldwide supply of dram also result from dram fab capacity expansions either by way of new facilities increased capacity utilization or reallocation of other semiconductor production to dram production several of our competitors have announced plans to increase production through construction of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities increases in worldwide supply of dram if not offset by increases in demand could lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

  

as the computer industry matures and the growth rate of computers sold or growth rate of the amount of semiconductor memory included in each computer decreases sales of our semiconductor products could decrease 

  

we are dependent on the computing market as most of the semiconductor products we sell are used in computers servers or peripheral products approximately 75 of our sales of semiconductor products for 2004 were to the computing market drams are the most widely used semiconductor memory components in computers in recent years the growth rate of computers sold has slowed or declined largely due to the maturation of the computer industry the reduction in the growth rate of computers sold or growth rate of the average amount of semiconductor memory included in each computer could reduce sales of our semiconductor products and our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

we may be unable to reduce our per megabit manufacturing costs at the same rate as we have in the past 

  

historically we have decreased per megabit manufacturing costs through improvements in our manufacturing processes including reducing the die size of our existing products in future periods we may be unable to reduce our per megabit manufacturing costs or reduce costs at historical rates we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance each generation of new products adds complexity to the manufacturing process and the initial production of new products is typically characterized by relatively high costs due to lower product yields reduced wafer throughput and less efficient use of assets reduction of per megabit manufacturing costs in future periods is dependent on our ability to 

  

•   successfully develop product and process technology including future transitions to 95nm and smaller linewidth process technologies

  

•   ramp product and process technology improvements rapidly and effectively to commercial volumes across facilities

  

•   achieve acceptable levels of manufacturing wafer output and yields which may decrease as we implement more complex technologies including our transition to 300mm wafer processing and

  

•   offset increases in per megabit manufacturing costs resulting from shifts in product mix to cmos image sensors specialty memory products and flash memory

  

if we are unable to timely and efficiently convert our manufacturing operations to 300mm wafer processing our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

in 2004 we began ramping production of 300mm wafers at our wafer fabrication facility in virginia as of the end of 2004 production at the virginia facility had not reached levels necessary to achieve mature product yield and costefficient utilization of the facility until such time that production at the virginia facility reaches mature product yields and significant volume with regards to capacity utilization it will adversely affect our results of operations we are assessing which of our other facilities will be converted to 300mm wafer fabrication and when those facilities will be converted we may also experience disruptions in manufacturing operations reduced wafer output and reduced yields during our conversion of other facilities to 300mm wafers 

  

we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments 

  

our cash flows from operations depend primarily on the volume of semiconductor memory sold average selling prices and per megabit manufacturing costs to develop new product and process technologies support future growth achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality we must make significant capital investments in manufacturing technology facilities and capital equipment research and development and product and process technology in addition to cash provided by operations we have from time to time utilized external sources of financing depending on general market and economic conditions or other factors we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and make adequate capital investments or access capital markets for funds on acceptable terms 

  

the semiconductor memory industry is highly competitive 

  

we face intense competition from a number of companies including elpida memory inc hynix semiconductor inc infineon technologies ag and samsung electronics co ltd additionally we face competition from emerging companies in taiwan and china who have announced plans to significantly expand the scale of their operations some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets 

  

  

in which we compete invest in technology and capitalize on growth opportunities our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity improve yields reduce die size and minimize mask levels in their product designs these factors have significantly increased worldwide supply and put downward pressure on prices 

  

historically various governments have provided economic assistance to international competitors which has enabled or artificially supported competitors’ production of semiconductor memory particularly dram this factor may continue to increase the supply of dram and other semiconductor products in future periods 

  

changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap and are reported in us dollars across our multinational operations there are transactions and balances denominated in other currencies primarily the japanese yen and euro in the event that the us dollar weakens significantly compared to the japanese yen or euro reported results of operations or financial condition will be adversely affected 

  

current economic and political conditions may harm our business 

  

throughout most of the 1980s and 1990s industry revenue for the dram market grew at a much faster rate than the overall economy driven by both growth in sales of computers and the amount of memory included in each computer sold in recent years the dram market has grown at a significantly slower rate as the computer industry has continued to mature as a result we expect that trends in the dram and computer industries will more closely parallel broader macroeconomic events and trends global economic conditions and the effects of military or terrorist actions may cause significant disruptions to worldwide commerce if these disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders a decrease in corporate spending on information technology or our inability to effectively market manufacture or ship our products our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected if for any reason we are unable to access the capital markets over an extended period of time we may be unable to make property plant and equipment expenditures implement our research and development efforts or fund our operations which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

if our tech joint venture experiences financial difficulty or if our supply of semiconductor products from tech is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

tech supplied approximately 30 of our total megabits of memory produced in 2004 we have agreements to purchase all of the products manufactured by tech subject to specific terms and conditions in recent periods we have realized higher margins on products purchased from tech than products manufactured by our whollyowned facilities any reduction in supply could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition as of september 2 2004 we had intangible assets with a net book value of 620 million relating to the supply arrangement to purchase product from tech in the event that our supply of semiconductor products from tech is reduced or eliminated we may be required to write off part or all of these assets and our revenues and results of operations would be adversely affected 

  

if we are unable to respond to customer demand for diversified semiconductor memory products or are unable to do so in a costeffective manner we may lose market share and our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

in recent periods the semiconductor memory market has become increasingly segmented with diverse memory needs being driven by the different requirements of desktop and notebook computers servers workstations handheld devices and communications industrial and other applications that demand specific memory solutions we offer customers a variety of semiconductor memory products including ddr ddr2 sdram edo flash and psram 

  

we need to dedicate significant resources to product design and development to respond to customer demand for the continued diversification of semiconductor products if we are unable to invest sufficient resources to meet the diverse memory needs of customers we may lose market share in addition as we diversify our product lines we may encounter difficulties penetrating certain markets particularly markets where we do not have existing customers if we are unable to respond to customer demand for market diversification in a costeffective manner our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

  

an adverse determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

as is typical in the semiconductor and other high technology industries from time to time others have asserted and may in the future assert that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their intellectual property rights we are engaged in litigation with rambus inc “rambus” relating to certain of rambus’ patents and certain of our claims and defenses on august 28 2000 we filed a complaint amended against rambus in us district court for the district of delaware seeking monetary damages and declaratory and injunctive relief among other things our amended complaint alleges violation of federal antitrust laws breach of contract fraud deceptive trade practices and negligent misrepresentation the complaint also seeks a declaratory judgment a that certain rambus patents are not infringed by us are invalid andor are unenforceable b that we have an implied license to those patents and c that rambus is estopped from enforcing those patents against us on february 15 2001 rambus filed an answer and counterclaim in delaware denying that we are entitled to relief alleging infringement of the eight rambus patents named in our declaratory judgment claim and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief a number of other suits are currently pending in europe alleging that certain of our sdram and ddr sdram products infringe various of rambus’ country counterparts to its european patent 525 068 including on september 1 2000 rambus filed suit against micron semiconductor deutschland gmbh in the district court of mannheim germany on september 13 2000 rambus filed suit against micron europe limited in the high court of justice chancery division in london england on september 22 2000 rambus filed a complaint against us and reptronic a distributor of our products in court of first instance of paris france on september 29 2000 we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of milan italy alleging invalidity and noninfringement in addition on december 29 2000 we filed suit against rambus in the civil court of avezzano italy alleging invalidity and noninfringement of the italian counterpart to european patent 1 004 956 on august 10 2001 rambus filed suit against us and assitec an electronics retailer in the civil court of pavia italy alleging that certain ddr sdram products infringe the italian counterpart to european patent 1 022 642 in the european suits against us rambus is seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief we also are engaged in litigation with motorola inc “motorola” and freescale semiconductor inc a subsidiary of motorola “freescale” relating to certain of our patents and certain of freescale’s patents on january 8 2004 motorola filed suit against us in the us district court for the western district of texas austin alleging infringement of ten motorola patents on march 15 2004 we filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging infringement of seventeen of our patents freescale was later added as a party with motorola on march 30 2004 we filed a separate action against motorola in the us district court for the western district of wisconsin madison alleging infringement of six additional of our patents and we added a seventh patent in an amended complaint filed on april 23 2004 on june 10 2004 the wisconsin court granted motorola’s motion to transfer the case to texas and the two cases subsequently were consolidated the above lawsuits pertain to certain of our sdram and ddr dram products which account for a significant portion of our net sales   we are unable to predict the outcome of these suits a court determination that our products or manufacturing processes infringe the intellectual property rights of others could result in significant liability andor require us to make material changes to our products andor manufacturing processes any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

  

we have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements some of these license agreements require us to make one time or periodic payments we may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms 

  

allegations of antitrust violations 

  

on june 17 2002 we received a grand jury subpoena from the us district court for the northern district of california seeking information regarding an investigation by the antitrust division of the department of justice the “doj” into possible antitrust violations in the “dynamic random access memory” or “dram” industry we are cooperating fully and actively with the doj in its investigation of the dram industry 

  

subsequent to the commencement of the doj investigation a number of purported class action lawsuits were filed against us and other dram suppliers sixteen cases were filed between june 21 2002 and september 19 2002 in the following federal district courts one in the southern district of new york five in the district of idaho and ten in the northern district of california the foregoing federal district court cases were transferred to the us district court for the northern district of california san francisco for consolidated proceedings on october 6 2003 the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint the consolidated amended complaint purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who purchased dram directly from the various dram suppliers during the period from approximately november 1 2001 through at least june 30 2002 the consolidated amended complaint alleges pricefixing in violation of the sherman act and seeks treble monetary damages costs attorneys’ fees and an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct eight additional cases were filed between august 2 2002 and march 11 2003 in the following california state superior courts five in san francisco county one in santa clara county one in los angeles county and one in humboldt county each of the california 

  

  

state cases purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchased dram during a specified time period commencing december 1 2001 the complaints allege violations of california’s cartwright act and state unfair competition law and unjust enrichment and seek treble monetary damages restitution costs attorneys’ fees and an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct the foregoing california state cases were transferred to san francisco county superior court for consolidated proceedings on october 15 2003 the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action complaint the consolidated amended complaint purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who purchased dram indirectly from the various dram suppliers during the period from november 1 2001 through june 30 2002 the consolidated amended complaint alleges violations of california’s cartwright act and state unfair competition law and unjust enrichment and seeks treble monetary damages costs attorneys’ fees and an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct on march 16 2004 a related case was filed in state court in salem massachusetts it purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchased dram in massachusetts between november 1 2001 and june 30 2002 the complaint alleges unjust enrichment relating to the sale and pricing of dram products and seeks an unspecified amount of restitution the case was removed to the massachusetts federal district court and transferred to the us district court for the northern district of california san francisco for consolidated proceedings however a motion by the plaintiff to remand the case to massachusetts is still pending on may 25 2004 a related case was filed in state court in collier county florida it purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchased dram in florida and nineteen other states between november 1 2001 and june 30 2002 the complaint alleges violation of the florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act and unjust enrichment relating to the sale and pricing of dram products and seeks compensatory damages costs attorneys’ fees and disgorgement or restitution on august 19 2004 a related case was filed in state court in middlesex county massachusetts it purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchased dram in massachusetts between september 1 2001 and june 30 2002 the complaint alleges violations of the massachusetts consumer protection act relating to the sale and pricing of dram products and seeks treble monetary damages costs and attorneys’ fees on september 29 2004 a related case was filed in state court in brooke county west virginia it purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchase dram in west virginia from at least 1999 through the filing of the complaint the complaint alleges violations of the west virginia antitrust act relating to the sale and pricing of dram products and seeks treble monetary damages costs and attorneys’ fees on october 4 2004 a related case was filed in state court in mecklenburg county north carolina it purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchase dram andor products containing dram in north carolina between at least 1999 and the filing of the complaint the complaint alleges violations of the north carolina statutes for antitrust and unfair competition relating to the sale and pricing of dram products and seeks actual damages treble damages interest costs and attorneys’ fees on october 5 2004 a related case was filed in state court in wayne county michigan it purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchase dram and or products containing dram in michigan from at least 1999 through the filing of the complaint the complaint alleges violations of the michigan antitrust reform act relating to the sale and pricing of dram products and seeks treble monetary damages costs interest and attorneys’ fees on october 6 2004 a related case was filed in state court in broward county florida it purports to be on behalf of a class of individuals and entities who indirectly purchase dram in florida from at least july 1999 through at least june of 2002 the complaint alleges violations of florida deceptive and unfair trade practices act relating to the sale and pricing of dram products and seeks monetary damages restitution costs and attorneys’ fees we are unable to predict the outcome of these suits based upon our analysis of the claims made and the nature of the dram industry we believe that class treatment of these cases is not appropriate and that any purported injury alleged by plaintiffs would be more appropriately resolved on a customerbycustomer basis we can give no assurance that final resolution of these civil suits will not result in significant liability and will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

allegations of anticompetitive conduct 

  

on may 5 2004 rambus filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of california san francisco county against us and other dram suppliers the complaint alleges certain causes of action under california state law including conspiracy to restrict output and fix prices on rambus dram “rdram” conspiracy to monopolize various relevant markets intentional interference with prospective economic advantage relating to rdram and unfair competition to disadvantage rdram the complaint seeks treble damages punitive damages attorneys’ fees costs and a permanent injunction enjoining the defendants from the conduct alleged in the complaint we are unable to predict the outcome of the suit a court determination against us could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

  

new product development may be unsuccessful 

  

we are developing new products that complement our traditional memory products or leverage their underlying design or process technology we anticipate expending significant resources for new semiconductor product development over the next several years there can be no assurance that our product development efforts will be successful that we will be able to costeffectively manufacture these new products that we will be able to successfully market these products or that margins generated from sales of these products will recover costs of development efforts 

  

we face risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

sales to customers outside the united states approximated 59 of our consolidated net sales for 2004 in addition we have manufacturing operations in italy japan puerto rico scotland and singapore our international sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks including 

  

•   currency exchange rate fluctuations

  

•   export duties changes to import and export regulations and restrictions on the transfer of funds

  

•   political and economic instability

  

•   problems with the transportation or delivery of our products

  

•   issues arising from cultural or language differences and labor unrest

  

•   longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and

  

•   compliance with trade and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions

  

these factors may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

if our manufacturing process is disrupted our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

we manufacture products using highly complex processes that require technologically advanced equipment and continuous modification to improve yields and performance difficulties in the manufacturing process can reduce yields or disrupt production and may increase our per megabit manufacturing costs from time to time we have experienced minor disruptions in our manufacturing process as a result of power outages or equipment failures if production at a fabrication facility is disrupted for any reason manufacturing yields may be adversely affected or we may be unable to meet our customers’ requirements and they may purchase products from other suppliers this could result in a significant increase in manufacturing costs or loss of revenues or damage to customer relationships which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

disruptions in our supply of raw materials could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards we generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials however only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards various factors could reduce the availability of raw materials such as silicon wafers photomasks chemicals gases lead frames and molding compound shortages may occur from time to time in the future in addition any transportation problems could delay our receipt of raw materials lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past if our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended our business results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

  

  

if we fail to achieve certain milestones we could be obligated to pay intel corporation amounts up to 135 million 

  

in conjunction with the issuance of stock rights to intel in september 2003 we agreed to achieve operational objectives through may 2005 including certain levels of ddr2 production and 300mm wafer processing capacity if we fail to achieve certain 2005 milestones and our common stock price is then below intel’s purchase price of 1329 we could be obligated to pay intel amounts up to 135 million a substantial portion of which is payable at our election in our common stock 

  

products that do not meet specifications or that contain or are perceived by our customers to contain defects or that are otherwise incompatible with end uses could impose significant costs on us or otherwise materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

because the design and production process for semiconductor memory is highly complex it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications contain defects or are otherwise incompatible with end uses if despite design review quality control and product qualification procedures problems with nonconforming defective or incompatible products occur after we have shipped such products we could be adversely affected in the following ways 

  

•   we may replace product or otherwise compensate customers for costs incurred or damages caused by defective or incompatible product and

  

•   we may encounter adverse publicity which could cause a decrease in sales of our products

  

we expect to make future acquisitions where advisable which involve numerous risks 

  

we expect to make future acquisitions where we believe it is advisable to enhance shareholder value acquisitions involve numerous risks including 

  

•   increasing our exposure to changes in average selling prices for semiconductor memory products

  

•   difficulties in integrating the operations technologies and products of the acquired companies

  

•   increasing capital expenditures to upgrade and maintain facilities

  

•   increasing debt to finance any acquisition

  

•   diverting management’s attention from normal daily operations

  

•   managing larger operations and facilities and employees in separate geographic areas and

  

•   hiring and retaining key employees

  

mergers and acquisitions of hightechnology companies are inherently risky and future acquisitions may not be successful and may materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

interest rate risk 

  

substantially all of the company’s investments are at fixed interest rates therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates the company believes that the market risk arising from its holdings of investments is minimal as the company’s investments generally mature within one year 

  

substantially all of the company’s debt is at fixed interest rates therefore the fair value of the debt fluctuates based on changes in market interest rates the estimated fair market value of the company’s debt approximated 12 billion as of september 2 2004 and 13 billion as of august 28 2003 the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement the “swap” that effectively converted beginning august 29 2003 the 25 fixed interest rate on the company’s 6325 million convertible subordinated notes the “notes” to a variable interest rate based on the 3month london interbank offering rate “libor” less 65 basis points the swap qualifies as a fairvalue hedge under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the swap is expected to be highly effective at offsetting the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the notes attributable to changes in interest rates 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s operations is the us dollar the company held aggregate cash and other assets in foreign currency valued at us 1189 million as of september 2 2004 and us 2031 million as of august 28 2003 including deferred income tax assets denominated in japanese yen valued at us 524 million as of september 2 2004 and us 1054 million as of august 28 2003 the company also held aggregate foreign currency liabilities valued at us 4036 million as of september 2 2004 and us 5132 million as of august 28 2003 including debt denominated in japanese yen valued at us 1131 million as of september 2 2004 and us 1705 million as of august 28 2003 foreign currency receivables and payables as of september 2 2004 were comprised primarily of japanese yen euros singapore dollars and british pounds the company estimates that based on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than us dollar as of september 2 2004 a 1 change in the exchange rate versus the us dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately 2 million for the japanese yen and 1 million for the euro
