opportunistic buying 

as an offprice retailer our buying practices which we refer to as opportunistic buying differentiate us from traditional retailers our overall global buying strategy is to acquire merchandise on an ongoing basis that will enable us to offer a desirable and rapidly changing mix of branded designer and other quality merchandise in our stores at prices below regular prices for comparable merchandise at fullprice retailers including department specialty and major online retailers we seek out and select merchandise from the broad range of opportunities in the market to achieve this end our global buying organization which numbers over 1200 associates and has offices across 4 continents in 12 countries executes this opportunistic buying strategy buying merchandise from more than 100 countries in a variety of ways depending on market conditions and other factors 

we take advantage of opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from the production and flow of inventory in the apparel and home fashions marketplace these opportunities include among others closeouts from brands manufacturers and other retailers special production direct from brands and factories order cancellations and manufacturer overruns our global buying strategies are intentionally flexible to allow us to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market and to adjust how and what we source as well as when we source it our goal is to operate with lean inventory levels compared to conventional retailers to give us the flexibility to seek out and to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise close to the time it is needed in our stores and online and when we have more visibility into fashion trends and price in contrast to traditional retailers which tend to order most of their goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor our merchants generally remain in the marketplace for goods throughout the year frequently looking for opportunities to buy merchandise we buy much of our merchandise for the current or immediately upcoming selling season we also buy some merchandise that is available in the market with the intention of storing it for sale typically in future selling seasons we generally make these purchases referred to as packaway in response to opportunities to buy merchandise that we believe has the right combination of brand fashion price and quality to supplement the product we expect to be available to purchase later for those future seasons we also acquire some merchandise that we offer under inhouse brands or brands that are licensed to us we develop some of this merchandise ourselves in order to supplement the depth of or fill gaps in our expected merchandise assortment 

manufacturers retailers and other vendors make up our expansive universe of approximately 21000 vendors including thousands of new vendors in 2021 across the globe which provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quality merchandise for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments and expect this will continue as we continue to grow we believe a number of factors provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise and make us an attractive channel for many vendors in the market we are typically willing to purchase lessthanfull assortments of items styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large we are able to disperse merchandise across our geographically diverse network of stores and to target specific markets we typically pay promptly according to our payment terms we generally do not ask for typical retail concessions such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries or return privileges and we have an excellent credit rating

 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in connection with all the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks that follow are those that we think individually or in the aggregate are potentially material to our business and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements 

operational and strategic risks 

our business financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has had and is continuing to have a significant impact on our business financial condition and results of operations many governments and private entities have issued various restrictions at different points in time since the emergence and spread of covid19 worldwide including for example travel restrictions restrictions on public gatherings limitations on business operations mask mandates vaccination requirements stay at home orders and advisories and quarantining protocols for a period in fiscal 2021 during the first major peak of the covid19 outbreak all of our stores online businesses and distribution centers were temporarily closed during which time we were unable to generate sales though we continued to incur expenses in response to the covid19 pandemic we also implemented new practices and protocols in our operations including enhanced cleaning protocols occupancy limitations and additional health and safety protocols that resulted in additional payroll and continued or increased expenses while potentially impacting sales opportunities many stores have had and in the future may again have additional temporary closures or be subject to additional restrictions further adversely impacting customer traffic and sales opportunities for example as of march 25 2022 certain countries in europe remained subject to covid19related shopping restrictions in addition market conditions and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and global supply chain have impacted and may continue to impact the financial viability or business operations of some of our suppliers and transportation or logistics providers which has interrupted and increased costs for and may in the future interrupt and further increase costs for our supply chain and could require additional changes to our operations we expect that our operations will continue to be impacted by the effects of the covid19 pandemic as it continues to evolve the extent of the impact will depend in part on future developments that are difficult to predict including the continued severity and spread of the virus and the success of prevention treatment and containment efforts globally the covid19 pandemic has also required and may continue to require us to make decisions that may be considered controversial about precautionary measures such as requiring vaccinations proof of vaccinations and face coverings that could impact our results including by impacting our brand reputation our associate retention and satisfaction and the willingness of customers to shop our stores 

further it remains difficult to predict with certainty the full impact of covid19 on the broader economy and how consumer behavior may change and whether such changes are temporary or permanent whether during the pandemic or possibly in a postpandemic epidemic or endemic phase levels of our customers’ spending at our stores and consumer discretionary spending more generally may be impacted by the ongoing pandemic and its impact on the economy social distancing telecommunicating and reductions in travel may become more typical and replace past patterns in addition the pandemic and related factors may have changed or change our associates’ willingness or ability to staff our stores and distribution centers or otherwise continue employment as a result of health concerns economic pressures or otherwise all of these conditions could impact the way our associates work affect our company culture and reputation and could have continuing adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to execute our opportunistic buying strategy and successfully manage our inventory could adversely affect our results 

key elements of our offprice business strategy including opportunistic buying operating with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns subject us to risks if we do not obtain the right merchandise at the right times in the right quantities at the right prices and in the right mix our customer traffic and our sales margins and other financial results could be adversely affected 

our opportunistic buying strategy places considerable discretion with our merchants they typically buy throughout the year with much of our merchandise purchased for the current or immediately upcoming season our merchants are expected to effectively react to rapidly changing opportunities and trends in the market to assess the desirability and value of merchandise and to generally make determinations of how and what we source as well as when and from where we source it if they do not make assessments accurately or otherwise cannot execute our strategy in an effective or timely way our customer traffic and our sales margins and other financial results could be adversely affected if our merchandise is not generally purchased at prices sufficiently below prices paid by conventional retailers we may not be able to maintain an adequate overall pricing differential to fullprice retailers including department specialty and major online retailers at various times or in some reporting segments banners product categories or geographies 

in addition to respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns we need to appropriately allocate and deliver merchandise to our stores maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store and be flexible in our allocation of floor space at our stores among product categories we also base our inventory purchases in part on our sales forecasts if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand either of which could adversely affect our financial performance 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact execution of our opportunistic buying strategy and inventory management our ability to allocate deliver and maintain our preferred mix and level of inventory has been impacted by temporary store closures and global supply chain disruptions including for example by increasing competition for limited shipping capacity and by other operational and market changes related to the global pandemic 

failure to identify consumer trends and preferences or to otherwise meet customer demand or expectations in new or existing markets or channels could negatively impact our performance 

as our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand and expectations we work to identify consumer trends and preferences on an ongoing basis and to offer inventory and shopping experiences that meet those trends and preferences however we may not do so effectively andor on a timely basis across our diverse merchandise categories and in each of the many markets in the us canada europe and australia in which we do business trends and preferences in markets may differ from what we anticipate and could change rapidly although our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer product preferences and trends for example by expanding and contracting merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes we may not successfully do so which could impact inventory turns customer traffic and sales and add difficulty in attracting new customers retaining existing customers and encouraging frequent customer visits which could adversely affect our results 

customers may also have expectations about how they shop in stores or through ecommerce or more generally engage with businesses across different channels for example through various digital platforms these expectations may vary both across and within demographics and geographies and may evolve rapidly or be impacted by external factors such as the covid19 pandemic’s impact on consumers’ shopping habits as well as their expectations for our stores including health and safety protocols meeting these expectations effectively generally involves identifying the right opportunities and making the right investments at the right time and with the right speed among other things and failure to do so may impact our financial results 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the retail apparel and home fashion businesses are highly competitive we compete on the basis of various factors affecting value which we define as the combination of brand fashion price and quality merchandise selection and freshness banner name recognition and appeal both instore and online service and shopping experience convenience and store location we compete with local regional national and international retailers that sell apparel home fashions and other merchandise that we sell including retailers that operate through stores ecommerce andor other media or channels some of our competitors are larger than we are or have more experience in selling certain product lines or through certain channels than we do new competitors frequently enter the market additionally existing competitors may enter or increase their presence in markets in which we operate consolidate with other retailers expand their merchandise offerings expand their ecommerce capabilities andor add new sales channels or change their pricing strategies consumer ecommerce spending has been increasing over the past few years ecommerce may continue to increase while our business is primarily in brick and mortar stores if we fail to compete effectively our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully implement our marketing efforts and these marketing efforts are not successful in driving expected traffic to our stores or if our competitors’ marketing programs are more effective than ours our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise may be influenced by our marketing efforts although we use marketing to drive customer traffic through various media including television radio print outdoor digitalsocial media email mobile and direct mail some of our competitors may expend more for their marketing programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage further we may not effectively develop or implement strategies with respect to rapidly evolving digital communication channels if our marketing efforts are not as successful or cost effective as anticipated our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected 

failure to continue to expand our business successfully could adversely affect our financial results 

our growth strategy includes successfully expanding within our current markets andor into new geographic regions product lines and channels including ecommerce and as appropriate adding new businesses whether by development investment or acquisition if any aspect of our expansion strategy does not achieve the success we expect in whole or in part we may fail to meet our financial performance expectations generally or within certain markets or divisions andor may be required to increase or decrease investments slow our planned growth or close stores or operations even if a particular market has high commercial vacancies if we are not able to find and lease appropriate real estate on attractive terms in the locations where we seek to open brick and mortar stores or for example if new stores do not perform as well as we anticipated we may need to change our planned growth in those markets 

growth can add complexity to effective information sharing and requires significant attention from our management and other functions across our business it also requires appropriately staffing and training an increased number of associates andor managing appropriate thirdparty providers these risks may increase with further growth particularly if we expand into additional countries if we are unable to manage our growth effectively our business may be adversely affected or we may need to reduce the rate of expansion or otherwise curtail growth which may adversely affect our business plans sales and results 

failure to effectively manage the large size and scale of our operations may adversely affect our financial results 

our substantial size can make it challenging to run our complex operations effectively and to manage suitable internal resources and thirdparty providers with appropriate oversight to support our business effectively including for administration systems including information technology systems merchandising sourcing store operations distribution logistics and compliance the large size and scale of our operations our multiple banners and locations across the us canada europe and australia and the autonomy afforded to the banners in some aspects of the business also increase the risk that our systems controls practices and policies may not be implemented effectively or consistently throughout our company that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations and that our marketing and communications strategies may lack cohesion the size and scale of our business also creates challenges in effectively managing training retaining and engaging a large disparate workforce these challenges may be exacerbated if a portion of our workforce is working remotely for all or part of their time as started to be the case during fiscal 2021 or is unable to work on site or is temporarily furloughed as was the case in recent years if we are unable to manage our size and scale effectively our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we source our merchandise globally which subjects us to risks including when moving merchandise internationally 

we are subject to various risks of sourcing merchandise particularly from other countries including risks related to moving merchandise internationally many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a lesser extent by us in locations particularly china india and southeastern asia different from the country in which they will be sold where we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements including those similar to requirements imposed upon the manufacturer of such products risks related to sourcing merchandise include 

– problems in thirdparty distribution and warehousing logistics transportation and other supply chain interruptions 

– potential disruptions in manufacturing and supply 

– transport availability capacity and costs 

– information technology challenges 

– changes in duties tariffs trade restrictions sanctions quotas and voluntary export restrictions on imported merchandise including for example additional trade requirements resulting from “brexit” the uk’s withdrawal from the european union tariffs and border adjustment taxes changes to the united states mexico canada agreement the successor to the north american free trade agreement or successor or other trade agreements 

– pandemics and epidemics including the ongoing covid19 pandemic affecting sourcing including manufacturing buying or delivery 

– strikes threats of strikes and other events affecting delivery 

– consumer perceptions of the safety or quality of imported merchandise 

– compliance with product laws and regulations of the destination country 

– compliance with laws and regulations including changing labor environmental international trade and other laws in relevant countries and those concerning ethical business practices such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 

– product liability claims from customers or investigations enforcement or penalties from government agencies relating to products that are recalled defective or otherwise noncompliant or alleged to be harmful 

– intellectual property enforcement and infringement issues 

– concerns about human rights working conditions and other labor rights and conditions in countries where merchandise is produced or materials are sourced such as concerns related to treatment of the uyghur population in the xinjiang province of china 

– concerns about transparent sourcing and supply chains 

– currency exchange rates and financial or economic instability and 

– political military or other disruptions in countries from to or through which merchandise is imported including in ukraine and russia 

these and other factors relating to sourcing international trade and imported merchandise could affect the availability and the price of our inventory and our operating costs furthermore although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to production of merchandise international operations and importing merchandise there can be no assurance that our associates and our contractors agents vendors or other third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our reputation operations or operating results 

our results and profitability could be adversely affected by labor costs including wage pension health and other costs or other challenges from our large workforce 

our associates are key to supporting our business and operations effectively and increased labor costs put pressure on our operating expenses which could adversely affect our financial results we have a large workforce and our ability to meet our labor needs and control labor costs is subject to various external factors such as minimum wage laws and benefits requirements market pressures including prevailing wage rates and benefit levels unemployment levels and competition for labor from other industries changing demographics and workforce trends economic conditions including inflation interest rate changes actuarial assumptions and methods the costs of providing and managing retirement health and other employee benefits including health and insurance costs and a dynamic regulatory and policy environment including with respect to covid19 related mandates and protocols health care immigration labor employment pension and other employee benefits and taxes any of these factors could increase our labor costs and the labor costs of our service providers which could be passed on to us increased labor costs may adversely affect our results of operations in addition when wage rates or benefit levels have increased in particular markets increasing our wages or benefits has and may continue to increase expenses and impact our earnings conversely failing to offer competitive wages or benefits could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain sufficient or quality associates causing our customer service or performance to suffer 

additionally many associates in our distribution centers are members of unions we are subject to the risk of labor actions of various kinds including work stoppages as well as risks and potential material expenses associated with multiemployer plans including from pension plan underfunding benefit cuts increased contribution or funding requirements changes in plan terms withdrawal liability increased premium costs conditions imposed under any governmental assistance programs or insolvency of other participating employers or governmental insurance programs certain of our associates in europe are members of works councils which may subject us to additional requirements actions or expense 

failure to employ quality associates in appropriate numbers and to retain key associates and management could adversely affect our performance 

we need to employ capable engaged associates for our stores and distribution centers in large numbers and for other areas of our business including information technology functions we must constantly recruit new associates to fill entry level and parttime positions with high rates of turnover and at times find seasonal talent in sufficient numbers the availability and skill of associates may differ across markets in which we do business and in new markets we enter and we may be unable to meet or manage our labor needs effectively in addition due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic and economic conditions we have faced and may continue to face additional challenges in recruiting sufficient talent due to shifts in the labor market wage pressures and competition and health and safety concerns among other factors as well as the challenges in engaging overseeing and training those associates who would typically work from our offices most of whom have worked primarily remotely since march 2020 and continue to work primarily remotely 

our performance also depends on recruiting hiring developing training and retaining talented associates in key areas such as buying and management similar to other retailers we face challenges in securing and retaining sufficient talent in management and other key areas for many reasons including competition for talent in the retail industry from other industries and in various geographic markets in addition because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must provide significant internal training and development for key associates across the company including within our buying organization and continue to adapt to doing so remotely for the most part and must effectively manage succession planning if we do not effectively attract qualified individuals train them in our business model support their development engage them in our business and retain them in sufficient numbers and at appropriate levels of the organization our growth could be limited and the successful execution of our business model could be adversely affected 

compromises of our data security disruptions in our information technology systems or failure to satisfy the information technology needs of our business could result in material loss or liability materially impact our operating results or materially harm our reputation 

our business depends on our information technology “it” systems which collect and process information of customers associates and other persons as well as information of our business and of our suppliers service providers and other third parties we rely heavily on it systems including those operated and maintained by our suppliers service providers and other third parties to manage all key aspects of our business including planning purchasing sales including pointofsale processing and ecommerce supply chain management inventory management human resources financial management communications information security and legal and regulatory compliance this reliance requires us to accurately anticipate our current and future it needs and successfully develop implement and maintain appropriate systems as well as effective disaster recovery plans for such systems our ongoing operations and successful growth are dependent on doing so as well as on the ongoing integrity security and consistent operations of these systems including related backup systems 

as is common in the retail industry our it systems as well as those of our suppliers service providers and other third parties whose information technology systems we utilize directly or indirectly are targeted by attempts to access or obtain personal or sensitive information attempts at monetary theft and attempts to disrupt business these attempts could include use of malware ransomware phishing social engineering denialofservice attacks exploitation of system vulnerabilities or misconfigurations employee malfeasance digital and physical payment card skimmers account takeovers and other forms of cyberattacks these attempts continue to increase in sophistication heightening the risk of compromise or disruption while certain of these attempts have resulted in data security incidents the unauthorized intrusion into our network discovered late in 2006 is the only such data security incident to date that has been material to the results of our operations our it systems and those of our suppliers service providers and other third parties also may be damaged or disrupted or personal or sensitive information compromised from a number of other causes including power outages system failures catastrophic events or associate or contractor error such damage disruption or compromise could materially impair our ability to operate our business or otherwise result in material impacts on our operating results 

changes in the business landscape and the increase of remote working for our associates service providers and other third parties have the potential to increase the likelihood of system damage or disruption and increase the risk of a data security compromise these factors have led to additional mitigation strategies and investments across our it security workforce technologies and processes in addition the global regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding and data security compromises and disruptions in our it systems could result in regulatory enforcement actions class actions contract liability or other forms of material legal liability any successful compromise or disruption of our it systems or other compromise of the information of our customers associates or other persons that we collect could result in material reputational harm and impact our customers’ willingness to shop in our stores or online andor our suppliers’ service providers’ or other third parties’ willingness to do business with us 

we maintain policies procedures and controls designed to reduce the risks of data security compromises and it failures or disruptions but such controls cannot fully eliminate such risks and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented these policies procedures and controls also require costly and ongoing investment in technologies hiring training and compliance 

there is also a risk of material business disruption liability and reputational damage associated with ongoing actions intended to update enhance modify or replace our systems and infrastructure including from not accurately capturing and maintaining data efficiently testing and implementing changes realizing the expected benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption of the actions and diversion of internal teams’ attention as the changes are implemented 

damage to our corporate reputation or those of our retail banners could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

our relationships with our customers and our reputation are based in part on perceptions of subjective qualities incidents involving us our retail banners our executives and other associates our board of directors our policies and practices our thirdparty providers our vendors and others within our supply chain the merchandise and brands including our licensed or owned brands that we sell our investments in regions where we have operations or investments our partners and our industry more generally that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and thereby impact our business particularly if the incidents result in rapid or significant adverse publicity protest litigation or governmental inquiry information on such incidents that is publicized through traditional or digital media platforms including social media websites blogs and other forums that facilitate rapid broad communications to an audience of consumers and other interested persons may adversely affect our reputation and brand even if the information is inaccurate incomplete or unverified similarly challenges or reactions to action or inaction or perceived action or inaction by our company to crises including the russian invasion of ukraine or a public health crisis like the covid19 pandemic or on issues like corporate responsibility responsible sourcing environmental sustainability climate change inclusion and diversity racial justice and equity human rights politics and lobbying privacy merchandising product safety compensation and benefits workplace environment labor compliance workforce reductions or other employment actions or other sensitive topics and any perceived lack of transparency about such matters could harm our reputation particularly as expectations of corporate action and of companies’ responsibilities in areas related to environmental social and governance “esg” issues have changed and may continue to change 

this kind of reputational damage could occur locally or globally and could impact our company or our individual retail banners damage to the reputation of our company and our banners could result in declines in customer loyalty and sales affect our vendor relationships andor business development opportunities limit our ability to attract and retain quality associates divert the attention and resources of management including to respond to inquiries or additional regulatory scrutiny and otherwise adversely affect our financial results 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our operations growth stock repurchases and dividends and interest and debt repayment 

our business depends upon our operations continuing to generate strong cash flow to supply capital to support our general operating activities to fund our growth and our return of cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase programs and dividends and to pay our interest and debt repayments if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or to repatriate cash from our international operations in a manner that is cost effective our growth plans capital expenditures operating expenses and financial performance including our earnings per share could be adversely affected changes in the capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of liquidity our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors including our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings we borrow on occasion to finance our activities and if financing were not available to us in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed it could also adversely affect our financial performance 

further expansion of our international operations could expose us to risks inherent in operating in new countries 

we have a significant retail presence in countries in europe and in canada and australia we also operate buying offices around the world our goal is to continue to expand our operations into other countries in the future it can be costly and complex to identify appropriate store locations and establish develop and maintain international operations and to promote business in new international jurisdictions which may differ significantly from other countries in which we currently operate 

just as with our current operations there are risks inherent in opening and developing operations in new countries such those related to compliance under the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act additional risks include among others understanding the local retail climate and trends local customs and cultures seasonal differences business practices and competitive conditions complying with relevant laws rules and regulations developing the appropriate infrastructure identifying suitable partners for local operations and for integration with our global operations and effectively communicating and implementing company policies and practices in new possibly remote jurisdictions there are also financial regulatory and other risks associated with international operations including currency exchange fluctuations potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds outside of the country where earned trade regulations the risk of sudden policy or regulatory changes the risk of political economic and civil instability and labor unrest and uncertainties regarding interpretation application and enforceability of laws and agreements any of these risks could adversely impact our operations profitability or liquidity 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate and may fall short of prior periods our projections or the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past including varying significantly from past quarters in recent years and may do so again in the future if we fail to increase our results over prior periods to achieve our projected results or to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price may decline as it did at times during fiscal 2021 and the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance results may be affected by various factors including those described in these risk factors we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to plan sales and align expenses if we do not control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results or if actual results differ significantly from our forecast our financial performance could be adversely affected in addition if we suspend our buyback program as we did during fiscal 2021 or if we have an active buyback program and are repurchasing shares but do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplated pursuant to our stock repurchase programs or if we reduce or suspend our dividend distributions as we did for part of fiscal 2021 our earnings per share may be adversely affected 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions or investments in new businesses or divest close or consolidate any of our current businesses our business could be subject to additional risks 

we may acquire new businesses as we have in the past with our australia business and with sierra invest in other businesses as we did with our minority investment interest in privately held familia a russian offprice apparel and home fashions retailer in fiscal 2020 or enter into joint ventures with other businesses develop new businesses internally as with homesense our additional us home store concept launched in fiscal 2018 launch or expand ecommerce platforms as we did in fiscal 2022 with homegoodscom a homegoods ecommerce business and divest as we plan to do with our familia interest close or consolidate businesses furthermore we may not be able to strategically divest certain assets or investments due to developments outside of our control failure to execute on mergers acquisitions investments divestitures closings and consolidations in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition acquisition investment or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses and we may not effectively evaluate target companies investments or investment partners or assess the risks benefits and costs of buying investing in or closing businesses or of the integration or attendant risks of acquired businesses or investments all of which can be difficult timeconsuming and dilutive these activities may not meet our performance and other expectations and may expose us to unexpected or greaterthanexpected costs liabilities and risks including for example from changes in law market conditions the retail industry or political conditions in addition we recorded intangible assets and goodwill and the value of the tradenames in connection with our last acquisitions and may similarly do so in the future in connection with other acquisitions if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or investments we may be required to impair some or all of the goodwill associated with an acquisition or investment which would adversely impact our results of operations and balance sheet such as with an impairment charge for example in connection with the ongoing conflict between russia and ukraine we announced our intention to divest our ownership interest in familia depending on how and when that divestment occurs we may not recover the full value of our investment divestitures closings and consolidations could involve risks such as significant costs and obligations of closure including exposure on leases owned real estate and other contractual employment pension and severance obligations and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or as a result of the credit risk of an acquirer we anticipate that we may recognize an investment loss or be required to record an impairment charge in connection with our planned divestiture of familia 

our large number of real estate leases which generally obligate us for long periods subject us to potential financial risk 

we lease virtually all of our store locations and either own or lease for long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices accordingly we are subject to the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate which can adversely affect our financial results while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions including by making specified payments we may not be able to terminate most of our leases if or when we would like to do so if we decide or are required to permanently close stores we are typically required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases which generally include among other things paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or paying to exercise rights to terminate and the performance of any of these obligations may be significant when we assign leases to third parties or if we sell or close a business we can remain liable on the lease obligations for the balance of the term and we are contingently liable if the assignee does not perform as was the case with some of our former operations we also remain primarily liable if we sublease space to a third party in addition when the lease terms for the stores in our ongoing operations expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to permanently close stores or to relocate stores within a market on less favorable terms or in a less favorable location 

failure to protect our inventory or other assets from loss and theft may impact our financial results 

risk of loss or theft of assets including inventory shrinkage is inherent in the retail business loss may be caused by error or misconduct of associates customers vendors or other third parties including through organized retail crime and professional theft our inability to effectively prevent andor minimize the loss or theft of assets or to effectively reduce the impact of those losses could adversely affect our financial performance 

external and economic risks 

economic conditions on a global level or in particular markets geopolitical uncertainty and other factors creating uncertainty and instability may adversely affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending which could affect our financial performance 

consumer confidence and discretionary spending can be affected by various economic conditions both on a global level and in particular markets that can in turn affect our business or the retail industry generally these factors include among others inflation and deflation actual or perceived declines in consumer purchasing power economic recession unemployment levels availability of disposable income and actual and perceived wealth health care costs costs of oil gas and other commodities interest rates and tax rates and related policies weakness in the housing market and housing costs volatility in capital markets and credit availability 

similarly in addition to the impact of regulatory or policy changes regulatory volatility or uncertainty including in areas such as international trade including us tariff policies challenges presented by implementation following brexit as well as threats or occurrences of war including russia’s invasion of ukraine terrorism pandemics or epidemics such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic supply chain disruptions geopolitical instability or uncertainty and political or social unrest andor conflict locally or across regions may have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending that can in turn affect our financial results and impact the retail industry generally these conditions and factors also shift trends in consumer spending that could affect our business although we believe our flexible offprice model helps us react to such changes they may adversely affect our sales cash flows merchandise orders and results of operations and performance 

changes in economic conditions on a global level or in particular markets may adversely affect our sources of liquidity and costs of capital and increase our financial exposure and our strategies for managing these financial risks may not be effective or sufficient 

global financial markets can experience volatility disruption and credit contraction which could adversely affect global economic conditions changes in economic conditions could adversely affect sources of liquidity available to us or our costs of capital including through capital markets in particular prolonged volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to the covid19 pandemic and russia’s invasion of ukraine could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources on acceptable terms or at all and impede our ability to comply with debt covenants in addition changes in economic conditions could adversely affect plan asset values and investment performance and increase our pension liabilities expenses and funding requirements and other related financial exposure with respect to companysponsored and multiemployer pension plans our strategies for managing these financial risks and exposures may not be effective or sufficient or may expose us to risk 

our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions catastrophic events or public health crises 

natural or other disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other extreme weather climate conditions public health issues such as pandemics and epidemics such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic fires or explosions acts of war such as russia’s invasion of ukraine domestic or foreign terrorism or other acts of violence including riots or active shooter situations or cyberterrorism nationstate cyberattacks or other cyber events could disrupt our operations in a number of ways including by causing injury or serious harm to our associates including when traveling on business or customers severely damaging or destroying one or more of our stores distribution facilities data centers or office facilities or could disrupt the operations of or require the closure of one or more of our vendors or other parts of our supply chain located in the affected areas daytoday operations including our ability to receive products from our vendors or thirdparty service providers or transport products to our stores or to our ecommerce customers could be adversely affected transportation to and from our stores by customers or associates could be limited or we could temporarily close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by affected distribution centers for a short or extended period of time as with closures of our stores and other facilities at various times due to the covid19 pandemic 

as our business is subject to seasonal influences a decrease in sales or margins a severe disruption or other significant event that impacts our business during the second half of the year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operating results 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we generally realize higher levels of sales and earnings in the second half of the year which includes the backtoschool and yearend holiday seasons any decrease in sales or margins or any significant adverse event during this period including those described in these risk factors could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations 

our results may be adversely affected by increased utility transportation or logistics costs reduced availability or increased cost of oil or other fuels or increased costs of other commodities 

energy and fuel costs can fluctuate dramatically and at times have resulted in significant cost increases particularly for the price of oil and gasoline an increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers although we typically enter into derivative instruments designed to manage a portion of our transportation costs a hedging strategy any such strategy may not be effective or sufficient and could result in increased operating costs increased regulation related to environmental costs including cap and trade carbon taxes or other emissions management systems could also adversely affect our costs of doing business including utility transportation and logistics costs shortages or disruptions including from increased demand and other factors impacting transportation within our supply chain also negatively impacts our cost of business for example in recent years increased freight costs related to labor equipment and capacity shortages involving freight hauling as well as other factors had an adverse impact on our margins in fiscal 2023 we anticipate that the conflict in ukraine and related sanctions on russia may impact fuel resources and operations of third parties along our supply chain such that our inventory flow and financial performance may be negatively impacted similarly other commodity prices can fluctuate dramatically such increases can impact the cost of merchandise which could adversely affect our performance through potentially reduced consumer demand or reduced margins 

adverse or unseasonable weather may adversely affect our sales and operating results 

adverse or unseasonable weather such as storms severe cold or heat or unseasonable temperatures even if not extreme may affect customers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop at all or in certain categories we offer particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise which could impact our sales customer satisfaction with our stores and our markdowns as a result our business could be adversely affected 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

sales made by our stores outside the us are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and changes in currency exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into us dollars for financial reporting purposes because of this movements in currency exchange rates have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our consolidated and segment results from time to time changes in currency exchange rates can also increase the cost of inventory purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the business buying the merchandise when exchange rates change significantly in a short period or move unfavorably over an extended period it can be difficult for us to adjust accordingly and gross margin can be adversely affected for example a significant amount of merchandise we offer for sale is made in china and accordingly a revaluation of chinese currency or increased market flexibility in the exchange rate for that currency increasing its value relative to the us dollar or currencies in which our stores are located could be significant 

additionally we routinely enter into inventoryrelated derivative instruments a hedging strategy to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rates on merchandise margins resulting from merchandise purchases by our segments denominated in currencies other than their local currencies these mitigation strategies may not be effective or sufficient in addition in accordance with gaap we evaluate the fair value of these derivative instruments and make marktomarket adjustments at the end of each accounting period these adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our earnings 

we expect that currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations from time to time in addition fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our earnings and operating results if a counterparty to one of our hedging arrangements fails to perform 

regulatory legal and compliance risks 

failure to comply with laws rules regulations and orders and applicable accounting principles and interpretations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

we are subject to national state provincial regional and local laws rules regulations mandates accounting standards principles and interpretations as well as government orders in various countries in which we operate that collectively affect multiple aspects of our business we are also subject to new and changing laws rules and regulations mandates evolving interpretations of existing laws by judicial and regulatory authorities changes in accounting standards or interpretations and reforms in jurisdictions where we do business these requirements current or changing could adversely affect our operating results including those involving 

– labor and employment practices and benefits including for labor unions and works councils 

– health welfare and safety requirements including vaccination andor testing requirements such as those implemented and proposed in connection with the covid19 pandemic 

– importexport supply chain social compliance trade restrictions and logistics including resulting from changes to requirements or policies from the outcome of brexit or the uyghur forced labor act 

– climate change energy and waste 

– consumer protection product safety and product compliance 

– marketing 

– financial regulations and reporting 

– tax 

– data protection and privacy such as to comply with or fines and penalties related to general data protection regulation in the european union and the california consumer privacy act 

– internet regulations including ecommerce electronic communications and privacy 

– protection of intellectual property rights and 

– compliance with governmental assistance programs 

complying with applicable laws rules regulations standards interpretations orders and our own internal policies may require us to spend additional time and resources to implement new procedures and other controls conduct audits train associates and third parties on our compliance methods or take other actions particularly as we continue to grow globally and enter new markets countries or product categories any of which could adversely impact our results particularly in a dynamic regulatory environment anticipated changes to laws and regulations may require us to invest in compliance efforts or otherwise expend resources before changes are certain 

in addition if we or third parties that perform services on our behalf fail to comply with applicable laws rules regulations standards interpretations and orders we may be subject to judgments fines or other costs or penalties which could adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition 

our results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation legal proceedings and other legal or regulatory matters 

we are involved or may in the future become involved in legal proceedings regulatory reviews audits and other legal matters these may involve inquiries investigations lawsuits and other proceedings by local provincial state and national governmental entities in the us and other countries and private plaintiffs including with respect to employment and employee benefits such as classification employment rights discrimination wage and hour and retaliation whistleblower claims harassment claims tax securities disclosure real estate environmental matters hazardous materials and hazardous waste tort business practices consumer protection privacydata security product safety and compliance advertising and intellectual property there continue to be employmentrelated and consumer protection lawsuits including putative class actions in the united states and we are subject to these types of suits we cannot predict the results of legal and regulatory proceedings with certainty and actual results may differ from any reserves we establish estimating the probable outcome regardless of merit or outcome these proceedings can be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expense and diversion of management attention legal regulatory and other proceedings could expose us to significant defense costs fines penalties and liability to private parties and governmental entities for monetary recoveries and other amounts and attorneys’ fees andor require us to change aspects of our operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

quality safety or other issues with merchandise we buy and sell could impact our reputation sales and financial results 

various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we import transport and sell to consumers regulations and standards in this area including federal regulations related to the us consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 and the us food safety modernization act state regulations like california’s proposition 65 and similar legislation in other countries in which we operate impose restrictions and requirements on the merchandise we buy and sell these regulations change from time to time and new national state provincial or local regulations in the us and other countries that may affect our business are contemplated and enacted with some regularity we rely on our vendors to provide quality merchandise that complies with applicable laws as well as our vendor code of conduct that requires our merchandise vendors to ensure the products they sell to us comply with all applicable laws and regulations however our vendors may not comply with such obligations if we or our merchandise vendors are unable or fail to comply with regulatory requirements on a timely basis or at all or to adequately monitor new regulations that may apply to existing or new merchandise categories or in new geographies we could incur significant fines or penalties or we could have to curtail some aspects of our sales or operations which could have an adverse effect on our financial results although our arrangements with our vendors frequently provide for indemnification for product liabilities the vendors may fail to honor these obligations to an extent we consider sufficient or at all in certain circumstances we may bear some responsibility for compliance with applicable product safety laws labeling requirements and other applicable laws in addition failure to comply with or the perception that we have failed to comply with other social compliance product labor andor environmental standards or monitoring practices which continue to evolve related to the products we sell could subject us reputational harm and impact our financial results 

concerns or issues with the quality safety and sourcing of merchandise particularly with products subject to increased levels of regulation or inquiry or the authenticity of merchandise regardless of whether unverified or not our fault could result in regulatory civil or criminal fines or penalties litigation or reputational harm any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including the results of tax audits and examinations income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory income tax rates changes in income tax rates changes in transfer pricing changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in applicable tax legislation including proposed legislation in the build back better act regulations treaties and other guidance and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “2017 tax act” significantly revised the previous federal income tax code additional interpretive guidance has been and will continue to be issued with respect to the 2017 tax act and such guidance may be different from our interpretation and thus adversely affect our results in addition it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the 2017 tax act which could also impact our tax obligations significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision and accruals for taxes and actual results may differ from our estimations 

in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by national state provincial and local tax authorities in the us and foreign countries and the examining authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various proceedings which are at various stages with such authorities with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these proceedings to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of our provision for income taxes and we increase and decrease our provision as a result of these assessments however developments in and actual results of proceedings rulings or settlements by or with tax authorities or courts including due to changes in facts law or legal interpretations expiration of applicable statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions could result in amounts that differ from those we have accrued for such proceedings in either a positive or a negative manner which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations in addition we are subject to tax audits and examinations for payroll value added salesbased and other taxes relating to our businesses which could adversely impact our financial results

results of operations 

matters affecting comparability 

the covid19 pandemic continued to impact the us and other countries around the world in fiscal 2022 during fiscal 2022 while our stores in the us and all of our ecommerce businesses remained open for the entire period we did have governmentmandated temporary store closures in europe canada and australia resulting in our stores being closed in the aggregate for approximately 4 of fiscal 2022 additionally intermittently throughout the year we operated under governmentmandated shopping restrictions including capacity limitations stores were temporarily closed for approximately 24 of fiscal 2021 due to temporary closures across all geographies overall our fiscal 2022 results were significantly better than our fiscal 2021 results 

in addition to comparing current year results to fiscal 2021 we may where meaningful also compare these results to a comparable period in the fiscal year ended february 1 2020 prior to the emergence of the pandemic we believe this additional comparison provides insight into how we are managing the business and performing as compared to our prepandemic results 

highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2022 include the following 

– net sales were 485 billion 321 billion and 417 billion for fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively as of january 29 2022 the number of stores in operation increased approximately 3 and selling square footage increased 2 compared to the end of fiscal 2021

– pretax margin the ratio of pretax income to net sales was 91 03 and 106 for fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively 

– a debt extinguishment charge of 02 billion reduced fiscal 2022 pretax margin by 05 percentage points and a debt extinguishment charge of 03 billion reduced fiscal 2021 pretax margin by 10 percentage point

recent events and trends 

divestiture of equity investment 

subsequent to the fiscal year ended january 29 2022 given the recent russian invasion of ukraine we committed to divesting our equity ownership in familia as of march 2 2022 douglas mizzi and scott goldenberg have resigned from their director and observer positions respectively on familia’s board of directors effective immediately as a result of this commitment to divest we may recognize an investment loss of up to 225 million prior to divestiture we may be required to record an impairment charge if the fair value of our investment in familia declines below its carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets 

in fiscal 2020 we invested 225 million for a 25 noncontrolling minority interest in privately held familia familia domiciled in luxembourg is an offprice retailer of apparel and home fashions with more than 400 stores in russia we account for our investment in familia using the equity method of accounting as of january 29 2022 the carrying value of our investment in familia was 186 million which reflects the revaluing of the investment from russian rubles to the us dollar resulting in a cumulative translation loss and reducing the carrying value of our investment by approximately 40 million see additional information on the equity investment in note a—basis of presentation and summary of accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 

covid19 

the significant impact of the covid19 pandemic on our global retail operations that began during fiscal 2021 continued to impact our business in fiscal 2022 we entered fiscal 2022 with significant ongoing global uncertainty related to the pandemic the health and safety of our associates and customers remained a top priority during fiscal 2022 and we continue to monitor developments including government requirements and recommendations that could result in possible additional impacts to our operations 

the below table represents total store days closed due to the covid19 pandemic as a percentage of potential total store days open in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 by segment 



net sales 

net sales totaled 485 billion 321 billion and 417 billion for fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively net sales from our ecommerce sites combined amounted to less than 3 of total sales for each of fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 

as a result of the extensive temporary store closures during fiscal 2021 due to the covid19 pandemic and our practice relating to the treatment of extended temporary store closures when calculating comp store sales we had no stores classified as comp stores at the end of fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 

for fiscal 2022 we temporarily reported openonly comp store sales as described below for fiscal 2023 we intend to return to our historical definition of comparable store sales while stores in the us were open for all of fiscal 2022 a significant number of stores in tjx canada and tjx international experienced covid19 related temporary store closures and governmentmandated shopping restrictions during fiscal 2022 therefore we cannot measure yearoveryear comparable store sales with fiscal 2022 in these geographies in a meaningful way as a result the comparable stores included in the fiscal 2023 measure will consist of us stores only which we intend to refer to as us comparable store sales and will be calculated against sales for the comparable periods in fiscal 2022 our historical definition of comp store sales is also presented below for reference 

fiscal 2022 vs fiscal 2021 

net sales increased 51 in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 our stores in the us and all of our ecommerce businesses remained open for the entire period while we had temporary closures in europe canada and australia resulting in our stores being closed in the aggregate for approximately 4 of fiscal 2022 as compared to stores across all geographies being temporarily closed for approximately 24 for fiscal 2021 in addition to stores being open for more days in fiscal 2022 net sales further increased due to higher customer traffic and increased average basket 

fiscal 2022 vs fiscal 2020 

net sales increased 16 and openonly comp store sales were up 15 for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2020 us openonly comp store sales were up 17 for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2020 this reflects an increase in average basket across all divisions customer traffic was up in the us where stores were open for all of fiscal 2022 and was down in geographies where we had covid19 related temporary store closures and governmentmandated shopping restrictions our openonly comp store sales increase in home fashions was significantly above our overall openonly comp increase in apparel we had strong openonly comp store sales growth during fiscal 2022 compared to the same period in fiscal 2020 

historical comparable store sales 

historically we defined comparable store sales or comp sales to be sales of stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation we calculated comp sales on a 52week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp percentage is immaterial 

sales excluded from comp sales “noncomp sales” consist of sales from 

– new stores  stores that have not yet met the comp sales criteria which represents a substantial majority of noncomp sales 

– stores that are closed permanently or for an extended period of time 

– sales from our ecommerce sites meaning sierracom tjmaxxcom marshallscom homegoodscom and tkmaxxcom 

we determine which stores are included in the comp sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year beginning in fiscal 2020 sierra stores that fit the comp store definition were included in comp stores in our marmaxx segment 

comp sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year’s comp sales using the prior year’s exchange rates this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance 

comp sales may be referred to as “same store” sales by other retail companies the method for calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry therefore our measure of comp sales may not be comparable to that of other retail companies 

we define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores and average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold we define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions 

openonly comp store sales 

due to the temporary closing of stores as a result of the covid19 pandemic our historical definition of comp store sales is not applicable for the reported periods since the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we temporarily reported openonly comp store sales openonly comp store sales includes stores initially classified as comp stores at the beginning of fiscal 2021 that had to temporarily close due to the covid19 pandemic this measure reports the sales increase or decrease of these stores for the days the stores were open in the current period against sales for the same days in fiscal 2020 prior to the pandemic openonly comp store sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year using fiscal 2020’s exchange rates 

revenues by geography 

the percentages of our consolidated revenues by geography for the last three fiscal years are as follows 

impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the us dollar or a division’s local currency in relation to other currencies we specifically refer to “foreign currency” as the impact of translational foreign currency exchange and marktomarket of inventory derivatives as described in detail below this does not include the impact foreign currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division’s local currency referred to as “transactional foreign exchange” also described below 

translation foreign exchange 

in our consolidated financial statements we translate the operations of tjx canada and tjx international from local currencies into us dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in assets liabilities net sales net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments currency translation generally does not affect operating margins or affects them only slightly as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period 

marktomarket inventory derivatives 

we routinely enter into inventoryrelated hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions principally tjx canada and tjx international as we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments as defined by us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we record a marktomarket gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period in subsequent periods the income statement impact of the marktomarket adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for while these effects occur every reporting period they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time the marktomarket adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales but it does affect the cost of sales operating margins and earnings we report 

transactional foreign exchange 

when discussing the impact on our results of the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on certain transactions we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange” this primarily includes the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on the yearoveryear comparison of merchandise margin as well as “foreign currency gains and losses” on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the operating divisions local currency these two items can impact segment margin comparison of our foreign divisions and we have highlighted them when they are meaningful to understanding operating trends 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs was 347 billion or 715 of net sales 245 billion or 763 of net sales 298 billion or 715 of net sales for fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively 

fiscal 2022 vs fiscal 2021 

the increase in the total cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs was primarily due to the additional cost of merchandise sold due to a higher level of sales in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 our stores were temporarily closed in the aggregate for approximately 4 of fiscal 2022 and approximately 24 of fiscal 2021 merchandise margin improved during fiscal 2022 primarily driven by favorable markdowns offset by increased freight costs in addition supply chain costs increased due to additional investments in distribution capacity and higher wages which along with freight costs are expected to continue into the next fiscal year 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs was favorably impacted by approximately 27 million and 78 million of government programs for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively in regions where we had temporary store closures 

fiscal 2022 vs fiscal 2020 

the expense ratio was flat for fiscal 2022 compared to the fiscal 2020 the ratio reflects the leverage on our occupancy costs due to the strong openonly comp store sales growth within merchandise margin strong markon and lower markdowns more than offset approximately 200 basis points of incremental freight costs in fiscal 2022 the occupancy and merchandise margin improvements were offset by higher supply chain costs primarily due to additional investments to expand distribution capacity and higher wage costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga expenses were 91 billion or 187 of net sales 70 billion or 218 of net sales and 75 billion or 179 of net sales for fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively 

fiscal 2022 vs fiscal 2021 

the increase in sga expense for fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by higher store payroll costs to support a higher sales volume in addition to these costs incentive compensation costs and other variable store costs such as advertising spend and credit processing fees were higher in fiscal 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021  

sga expense was favorably impacted by 214 million and 434 million from government programs for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021  respectively in regions where we had temporary store closures 

fiscal 2022 vs fiscal 2020 

the expense ratio increased 08 for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2020 the increase was driven by higher store payroll costs primarily due to incremental covid19 related payroll costs 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

on june 4 2021 we completed makewhole calls for our 125 billion aggregate principal amount of 350 notes maturing in 2025 and our 750 million aggregate principal amount of 375 notes maturing in 2027 as a result of these redemptions prior to their scheduled maturities we recorded a pretax debt extinguishment charge of 242 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 for additional information on the debt transactions see note j—longterm debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements 

in fiscal 2021 we completed the issuance and sale of certain of our notes and used the proceeds to partially fund the purchase of certain notes resulting in a pretax early extinguishment debt charge of 312 million 

interest expense net 

the components of interest expense net for the last two fiscal years are summarized below 

net interest expense decreased for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to the prior year’s refinancing of certain notes in december 2020 as well as the 275 billion pay down of outstanding debt during fiscal 2022 

provision benefit for income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 254 14 and 257 for fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively the increase in the fiscal 2022 effective income tax rate was primarily due to the significant increase in profit in fiscal 2022 as compared to the mix of income and losses by jurisdictions in fiscal 2021 

net income and diluted earnings per share 

net income was 33 billion 01 billion and 33 billion in fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2022 were 270 which included a second quarter debt extinguishment charge of 015 007 in fiscal 2021 which included a debt extinguishment charge of 019 and 267 in fiscal 2020 

segment information 

we operate four main business segments our marmaxx segment tj maxx marshalls tjmaxxcom and marshallscom and our homegoods segment homegoods homesense and homegoodscom both operate in the united states our tjx canada segment operates winners homesense and marshalls in canada and our tjx international segment operates tk maxx homesense and tkmaxxcom in europe and tk maxx in australia in addition to our four main segments sierra operates sierracom and retail stores in the us the results of sierra are included in the marmaxx segment 

we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest expense net and certain separately disclosed unusual or infrequent items “segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies the terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales these measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 

when discussing current year segment results in addition to comparing to fiscal 2021 we may where meaningful also compare these results to a comparable period in fiscal 2020 prior to the emergence of the pandemic 

presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments 

us segments 

marmaxx 

net sales 

net sales for marmaxx were 295 billion for fiscal 2022 an increase of 52 compared to 194 billion for fiscal 2021 the increase in net sales reflects stores remaining open for all of fiscal 2022 stores were closed for approximately 20 of fiscal 2021 as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition to stores being open for more days in fiscal 2022 net sales further increased due to higher customer traffic and increased average basket 

net sales increased 15 compared to 257 billion for fiscal 2020 openonly comp store sales were up 13 compared to fiscal 2020 the increase in openonly comp store sales for fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by an increase in average basket in addition customer traffic was up slightly while our openonly comp store sales increase in home fashions continued to significantly exceed those of apparel we had strong openonly comp store sales growth in apparel for fiscal 2022 during fiscal 2022 we had strong sales at marmaxx across all geographic regions 

segment profit 

fiscal 2022 vs fiscal 2021 

segment profit was 38 billion for fiscal 2022 an increase of 29 billion compared to a segment profit of 09 billion for fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily driven by increased sales due to stores remaining open for all of fiscal 2022 merchandise margin improved primarily due to lower markdowns partially offset by incremental freight costs fiscal 2021 also benefited 171 million from government programs 

fiscal 2022 vs fiscal 2020 

segment profit increased by 03 billion compared to a segment profit of 35 billion for fiscal 2020 primarily due to the increase in sales segment profit margin decreased to 129 for fiscal 2022 compared to 135 for fiscal 2020 the decrease was primarily driven by incremental covid19 related store payroll costs and higher supply chain costs partially offset by leverage on occupancy costs due to the strong openonly comp store sales growth and improved merchandise margin within merchandise margin strong markon and lower markdowns collectively more than offset incremental freight costs 

our marmaxx ecommerce sites tjmaxxcom and marshallscom together with sierracom represented less than 3 of marmaxx’s net sales for fiscal 2022 fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 and did not have a significant impact on yearoveryear segment margin comparisons 

in fiscal 2023 we expect to open approximately 55 marmaxx stores and 20 sierra stores which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2 

homegoods 

net sales 

net sales for homegoods were 90 billion for fiscal 2022 an increase of 48 compared to 61 billion for fiscal 2021 the increase in net sales reflects stores remaining open for all of fiscal 2022 stores were temporarily closed for approximately 20 of fiscal 2021 as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition to stores being open for more days in fiscal 2022 net sales further increased due to higher customer traffic and increased average basket

fiscal 2022 vs fiscal 2020 

segment profit increased by 02 billion compared to a segment profit of 07 billion for fiscal 2020 primarily due to the increase in sales segment profit margin decreased to 101 for fiscal 2022 compared to 107 for fiscal 2020 the decrease in segment profit margin was primarily driven by higher supply chain costs lower merchandise margin and incremental covid19 related store payroll costs and higher store wages partially offset by the expense leverage on our occupancy and administrative costs due to the strong openonly comp store sales growth within merchandise margin incremental freight costs more than offset strong markon and lower markdowns 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 homegoods made online shopping available on wwwhomegoodscom 

in fiscal 2023 we expect to open approximately 60 homegoods stores including 10 homesense stores which would increase selling square footage by approximately 7 

foreign segments 

tjx canada 

net sales 

net sales for tjx canada were 43 billion for fiscal 2022 an increase of 53 compared to 28 billion for fiscal 2021 the increase in net sales reflected temporary store closures which were closed for approximately 12 of fiscal 2022 and 29 of fiscal 2021 as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition to stores being open for more days in fiscal 2022 net sales further increased due to higher customer traffic and increased average basket

fiscal 2022 vs fiscal 2021 

segment profit was 05 billion for fiscal 2022 an increase of 04 billion compared to a segment profit of 01 billion for fiscal 2021 the increase for fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by increased sales due to having fewer temporary store closures in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 within merchandise margin lower markdowns and higher markon were partially offset by increased freight costs fiscal 2022 also reflected 84 million of government programs compared to 148 million for fiscal 2021 

fiscal 2022 vs fiscal 2020 

segment profit decreased 31 million compared to a segment profit of 516 million for fiscal 2020 segment profit margin decreased to 112 for fiscal 2022 compared to 128 for fiscal 2020 the decrease in segment profit margin was primarily driven by higher supply chain costs and higher store payroll including incremental covid19 related costs net of government programs this was partially offset by improved merchandise margin within merchandise margin strong markon and lower markdowns collectively more than offset incremental freight costs

the increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by higher sharebased and incentive compensation costs 

analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations supplemented as needed by shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper as of january 29 2022 there were no shortterm bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents internally generated funds and our credit facilities under which facilities we have 15 billion available as of the period ended january 29 2022 as described in note j—longterm debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements are adequate to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future 

as of january 29 2022 we held 62 billion in cash approximately 14 billion of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with 06 billion held in countries where we intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings we have provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in canada puerto rico italy india hong kong and vietnam through january 29 2022 if we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid 

we monitor debt financing markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may incur additional longterm indebtedness depending on prevailing market conditions liquidity requirements existing economic conditions and other factors during fiscal 2022 we have used and in the future we may use operating cash flow and cash on hand to repay portions of our indebtedness depending on prevailing market conditions liquidity requirements existing economic conditions contractual restrictions and other factors as such we may from time to time seek to retire redeem prepay or purchase our outstanding debt through redemptions cash purchases prepayments refinancings andor exchanges in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions by tender offer or otherwise if we use our operating cash flow andor cash on hand to repay our debt it will reduce the amount of cash available for additional capital expenditures 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 31 billion in fiscal 2022 and 46 billion in fiscal 2021 our operating cash flows decreased by 15 billion compared to fiscal 2021 due to the 47 billion change in merchandise inventories net of accounts payable driven by rebuilding inventory levels in fiscal 2022 as well as the timing of merchandise payments in fiscal 2021 in addition operating cash flows were negatively impacted by the 03 billion decrease in net operating lease liabilities due to the repayment of many of the rent deferrals negotiated in fiscal 2021 the decrease in operating cash flows was partially offset by a 32 billion increase in net income temporary store closures in fiscal 2021 resulted in net income of 01 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to net income of 33 billion in fiscal 2022 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 10 billion in fiscal 2022 and 06 billion in fiscal 2021 the cash outflows for both periods were primarily driven by capital expenditures and were lower in fiscal 2021 due to the covid19 pandemic 

net cash used in investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two fiscal years as set forth in the table below 

we expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2023 will be in the range of approximately 17 billion to 19 billion including approximat ely 10 billion to 11 billion for our offices and distribution centers including buying and merchandising systems and other information systems to support growth approximately 05 billion to 06 billion for store renovations and approximately 02 billion for new stores we plan to fund these expenditures with our existing cash balances and through internally generated funds 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 62 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to net cash inflows of 32 billion in fiscal 2021 in fiscal 2022 the cash outflows were primarily driven by debt repayments equity repurchases and dividend payments in fiscal 2021 the cash inflows were primarily driven by debt transactions 

debt 

the cash outflows in fiscal 2022 were due to the completion of makewhole calls and the redemption at par of certain of our notes the notes redeemed via makewhole calls were issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 in response to the covid19 pandemic as a result of these redemptions prior to their scheduled maturities we recorded a pretax debt extinguishment charge of 242 million in fiscal 2022 additionally in fiscal 2022 we redeemed at par 750 million principal outstanding 275 notes due june 15 2021 the result of these debt redemptions resulted in a 275 billion reduction of outstanding debt since the beginning of fiscal 2022 and will result in more than 90 million of annualized interest expense savings the cash inflows in fiscal 2021 were a result of completing the issuance and sale of 4 billion aggregate principal amount of notes see note j—longterm debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

equity 

in fiscal 2022 we lifted the temporary suspension of our repurchase program and we paid 22 billion to repurchase and retire 313 million shares of our stock on a settlement basis under our previously authorized stock repurchase programs prior to the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program we paid 02 billion to repurchase and retire 34 million shares on a settlement basis in fiscal 2021 these outflows for both periods were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options net of shares withheld for taxes of 02 billion in both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 

in january 2022 the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional 30 billion of our common stock from time to time we currently plan to repurchase approximately 225 billion to 25 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2023 we determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow liquidity economic and market conditions our assessment of prospects for our business legal requirements and other factors the timing and amount of these purchases may change as of january 29 2022 approximately 38 billion remained available under our existing stock repurchase programs for further information regarding equity repurchases see note d—capital stock and earnings per share of notes to consolidated financial statements 

dividends 

we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock of 026 per share for each of the quarters in fiscal 2022 which totaled 104 per share in fiscal 2022 as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic no dividends were declared in the first nine months of fiscal 2021 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 13 billion for fiscal 2022 and 03 billion for fiscal 2021 we expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2023 of 0295 per share or an annual dividend of 118 per share subject to the declaration and approval by our board of directors this would represent a 13 increase over the per share dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2022 

contractual obligations 

see the descriptions of our financing arrangements commitments and contingencies and contractual obligations outlined below and within the following notes to consolidated financial statements 

– see note j—longterm debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements for future payments under longterm debt arrangements including current installments 

– see note l—leases of notes to consolidated financial statements operating lease liabilities exclude legally binding minimum lease payments for approximately 170 leases signed but not yet commenced and include options to extend lease terms that are now deemed reasonably certain of being exercised according to our lease accounting policy the balances do not include variable costs for insurance real estate taxes other operating expenses and in some cases rentals based on a percentage of sales these items totaled approximately onethird of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2022 

– see note m—accrued expenses and other liabilities current and long term of notes to consolidated financial statements for longterm liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which includes 06 billion for employee compensation and benefits and 03 billion for uncertain tax positions 

– we also have noncancellable purchase obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items products and services used in our business including executive employment and other agreements 

critical accounting estimates 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap which requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable we consider our most critical accounting estimates involving uncertainty requiring management estimates and judgments to be those relating to the areas described below 

inventory valuation 

we use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except tk maxx in australia the businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale ie inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods however we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end we do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory 

reserves for uncertain tax positions 

similar to many large corporations our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation assessment examination litigation and settlement the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain in accordance with gaap we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the positions we have taken will not be sustained however in the next twelve months and in future periods the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay as the result of the final resolutions of examinations judicial or administrative proceedings changes in facts law or legal interpretations expiration of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of or changes in tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

loss contingencies 

certain conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our management with the assistance of our legal counsel assesses such contingent liabilities such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated we will accrue for the estimated liability in the consolidated financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable 

recent accounting pronouncements

equity price and other market risk 

the assets of our funded qualified pension plan a portion of which are equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets we invest the pension assets described further in note i—pension plans and other retirement benefits of notes to consolidated financial statements in a manner that attempts to manage our exposure to market uncertainties investments in general are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility risks a significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan resulting in increased required contributions to the plan or other planrelated liabilities our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes

opportunistic buying 

as an offprice retailer our buying practices which we refer to as opportunistic buying differentiate us from traditional retailers our overall global buying strategy is to acquire merchandise on an ongoing basis that will enable us to offer a desirable and rapidly changing mix of branded designer and other quality merchandise in our stores at prices below regular prices for comparable merchandise at fullprice retailers including department specialty and major online retailers we seek out and select merchandise from the broad range of opportunities in the market to achieve this end our global buying organization which numbers over 1100 associates and has offices across 4 continents in 12 countries executes this opportunistic buying strategy buying merchandise from more than 100 countries in a variety of ways depending on market conditions and other factors 

we take advantage of opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from the production and flow of inventory in the apparel and home fashions marketplace these opportunities include among others closeouts from brands manufacturers and other retailers special production direct from brands and factories order cancellations and manufacturer overruns our global buying strategies are intentionally flexible to allow us to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market and to adjust how and what we source as well as when we source it our goal is to operate with lean inventory levels compared to conventional retailers to give us the flexibility to seek out and to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise close to the time it is needed in our stores and online and when we have more visibility into fashion trends and price in contrast to traditional retailers which tend to order most of their goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor our merchants generally remain in the marketplace for goods throughout the year frequently looking for opportunities to buy merchandise we buy much of our merchandise for the current or immediately upcoming selling season we also buy some merchandise that is available in the market with the intention of storing it for sale typically in future selling seasons we generally make these purchases referred to as packaway in response to opportunities to buy merchandise that we believe has the right combination of brand fashion price and quality to supplement the product we expect to be available to purchase later for those future seasons we also acquire some merchandise that we offer under inhouse brands or brands that are licensed to us we develop some of this merchandise ourselves in order to supplement the depth of or fill gaps in our expected merchandise assortment 

manufacturers retailers and other vendors make up our expansive universe of approximately 21000 vendors which provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quality merchandise for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments and expect this will continue as we continue to grow we believe a number of factors provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise and make us an attractive channel for many vendors in the market we are typically willing to purchase lessthanfull assortments of items styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large we are able to disperse merchandise across our geographically diverse network of stores and to target specific markets we typically pay promptly according to our payment terms we generally do not ask for typical retail concessions such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries or return privileges and we have an excellent credit rating

 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in connection with all the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks that follow are those that we think individually or in the aggregate are potentially material to our business and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements 

operational and strategic risks 

our business has been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the impact of the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

after covid19 emerged and spread worldwide the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic in march 2020 national state and local governments as well as private entities began issuing various restrictions including travel restrictions restrictions on public gatherings limitations on business operations stay at home orders and advisories and quarantining protocols the temporary closures of our stores online businesses and distribution centers and additional operating expenses and other impacts from the ongoing pandemic have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business operations financial position and liquidity for example during the time our facilities were closed in the first half of fiscal 2021 and our daytoday retail operations were suspended we were unable to generate sales at the same time we continued to incur expenses including labor occupancy and other costs such as continued pay for certain associates during closures continued employee benefits coverage for eligible associates during temporary furloughs at no cost to impacted associates in the us and canada and comparable actions with respect to portions of our tjx europe workforce as our stores and facilities reopened we implemented new practices and protocols including enhanced cleaning protocols occupancy limitations and additional health and safety protocols that resulted in additional payroll and continued or increased expenses while potentially impacting sales opportunities many stores have had additional temporary closures since we began reopening in may 2020 with the vast majority of the closures in europe and canada and some stores and facilities are currently closed andor may be closed again in the future further adversely impacting sales opportunities some of these pandemicrelated expenses andor operational limits have continued into the beginning of fiscal 2022 and we expect they may continue to some extent in the future in addition the pandemic may have changed our associates’ willingness or ability to staff our stores and distribution centers or otherwise continue employment as a result of health concerns economic pressures or otherwise 

further changes in our customers’ willingness to shop our stores the levels of our customers’ spending at our stores and the more general impact of the ongoing pandemic on the economy and consumer discretionary spending for example as a result of erosion in consumer sentiment or the impact of high unemployment or otherwise have also impacted and may continue to impact our business operations financial performance and liquidity we have seen reduced customer traffic and sales declines in most of our divisions these declines could continue or accelerate for the remainder of the pandemic and beyond in addition market conditions and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy have impacted and may continue to impact the financial viability or business operations of some of our suppliers and transportation or logistics providers which has interrupted and increased costs for and may in the future interrupt and further increase costs for our supply chain and could require additional changes to our operations 

the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business will depend on future developments which remain highly uncertain and difficult to predict including the duration severity and sustained geographic spread of the pandemic additional waves of increased infections the virulence and spread of different strains of the virus and the extent to which associated prevention containment remediation and treatment efforts including global vaccination programs are successful 

failure to execute our opportunistic buying strategy and successfully manage our inventory could adversely affect our results 

key elements of our offprice business strategy including opportunistic buying operating with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns subject us to risks if we do not obtain the right merchandise at the right times in the right quantities at the right prices and in the right mix our customer traffic and our sales margins and other financial results could be adversely affected 

our opportunistic buying strategy places considerable discretion with our merchants they typically buy throughout the year with much of our merchandise purchased for the current or immediately upcoming season our merchants are expected to effectively react to rapidly changing opportunities and trends in the market to assess the desirability and value of merchandise and to generally make determinations of how and what we source as well as when and from where we source it if they do not make assessments accurately or otherwise cannot execute our strategy in an effective or timely way our customer traffic and our sales margins and other financial results could be adversely affected if our merchandise is not generally purchased at prices sufficiently below prices paid by conventional retailers we may not be able to maintain an adequate overall pricing differential to fullprice retailers including department specialty and major online retailers at various times or in some reporting segments banners product categories or geographies 

in addition to respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns we need to appropriately allocate and deliver merchandise to our stores maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store and be flexible in our allocation of floor space at our stores among product categories we also base our inventory purchases in part on our sales forecasts if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand either of which could adversely affect our financial performance 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact execution of our opportunistic buying strategy and inventory management our ability to allocate deliver and maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory was also impacted during fiscal 2021 by temporary closures of our stores distribution centers and ecommerce sites including by affecting decisions on markdowns packaway and perishables particularly in the second quarter when our stores and distribution centers reopened after the first temporary closures and by other operational and market changes related to the global pandemic 

if we fail to successfully implement our various marketing efforts or if our competitors’ programs are more effective than ours our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise may be influenced by our marketing efforts although we use marketing to drive customer traffic through various media including television radio print outdoor digitalsocial media email mobile and direct mail some of our competitors may expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage further we may not effectively develop or implement strategies with respect to rapidly evolving digital communication channels if our marketing efforts are not as successful or cost effective as anticipated our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected 

failure to identify consumer trends and preferences or to otherwise meet customer demand or expectations in new or existing markets or channels could negatively impact our performance 

as our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand and expectations we work to identify consumer trends and preferences on an ongoing basis and to offer inventory and shopping experiences that meet those trends and preferences however we may not do so effectively andor on a timely basis across our diverse merchandise categories and in each of the many markets in the us canada europe and australia in which we do business trends and preferences in markets may differ from what we anticipate and could change rapidly as they did during fiscal 2021 in connection with the ongoing covid19 pandemic although our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer product preferences and trends for example by expanding and contracting merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes we may not successfully do so which could impact inventory turns customer traffic and sales and add difficulty in attracting new customers retaining existing customers and encouraging frequent customer visits which could adversely affect our results 

customers may also have expectations about how they shop in stores or through ecommerce or more generally engage with businesses across different channels for example through various digital platforms these expectations may vary both across and within demographics and geographies and may evolve rapidly or be impacted by external factors such as the covid19 pandemic’s impact on consumers’ comfort levels in visiting stores as well as their expectations for our stores including health and safety protocols meeting these expectations effectively generally involves identifying the right opportunities and making the right investments at the right time and with the right speed among other things and failure to do so may impact our financial results 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the retail apparel and home fashion businesses are highly competitive we compete on the basis of various factors affecting value which we define as the combination of brand fashion price and quality – merchandise selection and freshness banner name recognition and appeal both instore and online service and shopping experience convenience and store location we compete with local regional national and international retailers that sell apparel home fashions and other merchandise that we sell including retailers that operate through stores ecommerce andor other media or channels some of our competitors are larger than we are or have more experience in selling certain product lines or through certain channels than we do new competitors frequently enter the market additionally existing competitors may enter or increase their presence in markets in which we operate consolidate with other retailers expand their merchandise offerings expand their ecommerce capabilities andor add new sales channels or change their pricing strategies during fiscal 2021 additional regulations or health and safety concerns related to the ongoing pandemic impacted our competitors differently based on factors such as location sales channel strategy merchandising strategy and others consumer spending online which has been increasing also appears to have accelerated as a result of the covid19 pandemic ecommerce may continue to increase while our business is primarily in brick and mortar stores if we fail to compete effectively our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 

failure to continue to expand our business successfully could adversely affect our financial results 

our growth strategy includes successfully expanding within our current markets andor into new geographic regions product lines and channels including ecommerce and as appropriate adding new businesses whether by development investment or acquisition if any aspect of our expansion strategy does not achieve the success we expect in whole or in part we may fail to meet our financial performance expectations generally or within certain markets or divisions andor may be required to increase investments slow our planned growth or close stores or operations for example if we are not able to find and lease appropriate real estate on attractive terms in the locations where we seek to open brick and mortar stores or if new stores do not perform as well as we anticipated we may need to change our planned growth in those markets 

growth can add complexity to effective information sharing and requires significant attention from our management and other functions across our business it also requires appropriately staffing and training an increased number of associates andor managing appropriate thirdparty providers these risks may increase with further growth particularly if we expand into additional countries if we are unable to manage our growth effectively our business may be adversely affected or we may need to reduce the rate of expansion or otherwise curtail growth which may adversely affect our business plans sales and results 

failure to effectively manage the large size and scale of our operations may adversely affect our financial results 

our substantial size can make it challenging to run our complex operations effectively and to manage suitable internal resources and third party providers with appropriate oversight to support our business effectively including for administration systems including information technology systems merchandising sourcing store operations distribution logistics and compliance the large size and scale of our operations our multiple banners and locations across the us canada europe and australia and the autonomy afforded to the banners in some aspects of the business also increase the risk that our systems controls practices and policies may not be implemented effectively or consistently throughout our company that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations and that our marketing and communications strategies may lack cohesion the size and scale of our business also creates challenges in effectively managing training retaining and engaging a large disparate workforce these challenges may be exacerbated if a large portion of our workforce is unable to work on site temporarily furloughed or working remotely as was the case during parts of fiscal 2021 if we are unable to manage our size and scale effectively our results of operations may be adversely affected 

we source our merchandise globally which subjects us to risks including when moving merchandise internationally 

we are subject to various risks of sourcing merchandise particularly from other countries including risks related to moving merchandise internationally many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a lesser extent by us in locations particularly china india and southeastern asia which are outside of the country where they will be sold where we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements including those similar to requirements imposed upon the manufacturer of such products risks related to sourcing merchandise include 

– potential disruptions in manufacturing and supply 

– changes in duties tariffs trade restrictions sanctions quotas and voluntary export restrictions on imported merchandise including for example changes to trade requirements resulting from the uk’s withdrawal in january 2020 from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” tariffs and border adjustment taxes changes to the united states mexico canada agreement the successor to the north american free trade agreement or successor or other trade agreements 

– transport availability capacity and costs 

– information technology challenges 

– problems in thirdparty distribution and warehousing logistics transportation and other supply chain interruptions 

– strikes threats of strikes and other events affecting delivery 

– consumer perceptions of the safety or quality of imported merchandise 

– compliance with product laws and regulations of the destination country 

– compliance with laws and regulations including changing labor environmental international trade and other laws in relevant countries and those concerning ethical business practices such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 

– product liability claims from customers or investigations enforcement or penalties from government agencies relating to products that are recalled defective or otherwise noncompliant or alleged to be harmful 

– intellectual property enforcement and infringement issues 

– pandemics and epidemics including the ongoing covid19 pandemic affecting sourcing including manufacturing buying or delivery 

– concerns about human rights working conditions and other labor rights and conditions in countries where merchandise is produced or materials are sourced such as the concerns related to treatment of the uyghur population in the xinjiang province of china 

– concerns about transparent sourcing and supply chains 

– currency exchange rates and financial or economic instability and 

– political or other disruptions in countries from to or through which merchandise is imported 

these and other factors relating to sourcing international trade and imported merchandise could affect the availability and the price of our inventory and our operating costs furthermore although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to production of merchandise international operations and importing merchandise there can be no assurance that our associates and our contractors agents vendors or other third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our reputation operations or operating results 

our results and profitability could be adversely affected by labor costs including wage pension and healthcare costs or other challenges from our large workforce 

our associates are key to supporting our business and operations effectively and increased labor costs put pressure on our operating expenses which could adversely affect our financial results we have a large workforce and our ability to meet our labor needs and control labor costs is subject to various external factors such as minimum wage laws and benefits requirements market pressures including prevailing wage rates and benefit levels and unemployment levels changing demographics economic conditions interest rate changes actuarial assumptions and methods the costs of providing and managing retirement health and other employee benefits including health and insurance costs and a dynamic regulatory and policy environment including with respect to health care immigration labor employment pension and other employee benefits and taxes any of these factors could increase our labor costs increased labor costs may adversely affect our results of operations in addition when wage rates or benefit levels have increased in particular markets increasing our wages or benefits has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our earnings conversely failing to offer competitive wages or benefits could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain sufficient or quality associates causing our customer service or performance to suffer 

additionally many associates in our distribution centers are members of unions we are subject to the risk of labor actions of various kinds including work stoppages as well as risks and potential material expenses associated with multiemployer plans including from pension plan underfunding benefit cuts increased contribution or funding requirements changes in plan terms withdrawal liability increased premium costs conditions imposed under any governmental assistance programs or insolvency of other participating employers or governmental insurance programs certain of our associates in europe are members of works councils which may subject us to additional requirements actions or expense 

failure to employ quality associates in appropriate numbers and to retain key associates and management could adversely affect our performance 

we need to employ capable engaged associates in large numbers for our stores and distribution centers and to a lesser extent for other areas of our business including information technology functions we must constantly recruit new associates to fill entry level and parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover and at times find seasonal talent in sufficient numbers the availability and skill of associates may differ across markets in which we do business and in new markets we enter and we may be unable to meet or manage our labor needs effectively in addition due to the ongoing covid19 pandemic we have faced and may continue to face additional challenges in recruiting sufficient talent due to health and safety concerns and disruption to the availability of school or childcare among other factors as well as the challenges in engaging overseeing and training those associates who would typically work from our offices most of whom have been working remotely since march 2020 

our performance also depends on recruiting hiring developing training and retaining talented associates in key areas such as buying and management similar to other retailers we face challenges in securing and retaining sufficient talent in management and other key areas for many reasons including competition for talent in the retail industry and in various geographic markets in addition because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must provide significant internal training and development for key associates across the company including within our buying organization and must effectively manage succession planning if we do not effectively attract qualified individuals train them in our business model support their development engage them in our business and retain them in sufficient numbers and at appropriate levels of the organization our growth could be limited and the successful execution of our business model could be adversely affected 

compromises of our data security disruptions in our information technology systems or failure to satisfy the information technology needs of our business could result in material loss or liability materially impact our operating results or materially harm our reputation 

our business depends on our information technology “it” systems which collect and process information of customers associates and other persons as well as information of our business and of our suppliers service providers and other third parties we rely heavily on information technology systems including those operated and maintained by our suppliers service providers and other third parties to manage all key aspects of our business including planning purchasing sales including pointofsale processing and ecommerce supply chain management inventory management human resources financial management communications information security and legal and regulatory compliance this reliance requires us to accurately anticipate our current and future information technology needs and successfully develop implement and maintain appropriate systems as well as effective disaster recovery plans for such systems our ongoing operations and successful growth are dependent on doing so as well as the ongoing integrity security and consistent operations of these systems including related backup systems 

as is common in the retail industry our information technology systems as well as those of our suppliers service providers and other third parties whose information technology systems we utilize directly or indirectly are targeted by attempts to access or obtain personal or sensitive information attempts at monetary theft and attempts to disrupt business these attempts could include use of malware ransomware phishing social engineering denialofservice attacks exploitation of system vulnerabilities employee malfeasance digital and physical skimmers account takeovers and other forms of cyber attacks these attempts are becoming increasingly sophisticated heightening the risk of compromise or disruption our information technology systems and those of our suppliers service providers and other third parties also may be damaged or disrupted or personal or sensitive information compromised from a number of other causes including power outages system failures catastrophic events or employee error such damage disruption or compromise could materially impair our ability to operate our business or otherwise result in material impacts on our operating results 

changes in the business landscape and the increase of remote working for our associates service providers and other third parties have the potential to increase the likelihood of system damage or disruption and increase the risk of a data security compromise these factors have led to additional mitigation strategies and investments across our it security workforce technologies and processes in addition the global regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding and unauthorized access of personal or sensitive information could result in regulatory enforcement actions class actions contract liability or other forms of material legal liability any successful compromise or disruption of our information technology systems or other compromise of the information of our customers associates or other persons that we collect could result in material reputational harm and impact our customers’ willingness to shop in our stores or online andor our suppliers’ service providers’ or other third parties’ willingness to do business with us 

we maintain policies procedures and controls designed to reduce the risks of data security compromises and information technology failures or disruptions but such controls cannot fully eliminate such risks and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented while we have implemented measures designed to further strengthen these policies procedures and controls since the unauthorized intrusions into our network discovered late in 2006 we may suffer a similar or different cyber event in the future these measures also require costly and ongoing investment in technologies hiring training and compliance 

there is a risk of material business disruption liability and reputational damage associated with ongoing actions intended to update enhance modify or replace our systems and infrastructure including from not accurately capturing and maintaining data efficiently testing and implementing changes realizing the expected benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption of the actions and diversion of internal teams’ attention as the changes are implemented 

damage to our corporate reputation or those of our retail banners could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

our relationships with our customers and our reputation are based in part on perceptions of subjective qualities incidents involving us our retail banners our executives and other associates our board of directors our policies and practices our third party providers our vendors and others within our supply chain the merchandise and brands including our licensed or owned brands that we sell our partners and our industry more generally that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and thereby impact our business particularly if the incidents result in rapid or significant adverse publicity protest litigation or governmental inquiry information on such incidents that is publicized through traditional or digital media platforms including social media websites blogs and other forums that facilitate rapid broad communications to an audience of consumers and other interested persons may adversely affect our reputation and brand even if the information is inaccurate incomplete or unverified similarly challenges or reactions to action or inaction or perceived action or inaction by our company to crises including the covid19 pandemic or on issues like corporate responsibility responsible sourcing environmental sustainability inclusion and diversity including racial justice and equity human rights politics and lobbying privacy merchandising product safety compensation and benefits labor compliance workforce reductions or other employment actions or other sensitive topics and any perceived lack of transparency about such matters could harm our reputation particularly as expectations of corporate action and of companies’ corporate responsibility obligations have changed and may continue to change 

this kind of reputational damage could occur locally or globally and could impact our company or our individual retail banners damage to the reputation of our company and our banners could result in declines in customer loyalty and sales affect our vendor relationships andor business development opportunities limit our ability to attract and retain quality associates divert the attention and resources of management including to respond to inquiries or additional regulatory scrutiny and otherwise adversely affect our results 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our operations growth stock repurchases and dividends and interest and debt repayment 

our business depends upon our operations to continue to generate strong cash flow to supply capital to support our general operating activities to fund our growth and our return of cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase programs and dividends and to pay our interest and debt repayments if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows due to the ongoing pandemic or otherwise or to repatriate cash from our international operations in a manner that is cost effective our growth plans capital expenditures operating expenses and financial performance including our earnings per share could be adversely affected changes in the capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of liquidity our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors including our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings we borrow on occasion to finance our activities and if financing were not available to us in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed it could also adversely affect our financial performance 

further expansion of our international operations could expose us to risks inherent in operating in new countries 

we have a significant retail presence in countries in europe and in canada and australia we also operate buying offices around the world our goal is to continue to expand our operations into other countries in the future it can be costly and complex to identify appropriate store locations and establish develop and maintain international operations and to promote business in new international jurisdictions which may differ significantly from other countries in which we currently operate 

just as with our current operations there are risks inherent in opening and developing operations in new countries such those related to compliance under the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act additional risks include among others understanding the local retail climate and trends local customs and cultures seasonal differences business practices and competitive conditions complying with relevant laws rules and regulations developing the appropriate infrastructure identifying suitable partners for local operations and for integration with our global operations and effectively communicating and implementing company policies and practices in new possibly remote jurisdictions there are also financial regulatory and other risks associated with international operations including currency exchange fluctuations potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds outside of the country where earned trade regulations the risk of sudden policy or regulatory changes the risk of political economic and civil instability and labor unrest and uncertainties regarding interpretation application and enforceability of laws and agreements any of these risks could adversely impact our operations profitability or liquidity 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate and may fall short of prior periods our projections or the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past including varying significantly from past quarters during fiscal 2021 and may do so again in the future if we fail to increase our results over prior periods to achieve our projected results or to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price may decline as it did at times during fiscal 2021 and the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance results may be affected by various factors including those described in these risk factors we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to plan sales and align expenses if we do not control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results or if actual results differ significantly from our forecast our financial performance could be adversely affected in addition if we suspend our buyback program as we did during fiscal 2021 or if we have an active buyback program and are repurchasing shares but do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplated pursuant to our stock repurchase programs or if we reduce or suspend our dividend distributions our earnings per share may be adversely affected 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions or investments in new businesses or divest close or consolidate any of our current businesses our business could be subject to additional risks 

we may acquire new businesses as we have in the past with our australia business and with sierra invest in other businesses as we did with our minority investment interest in privately held familia a russian offprice apparel and home fashions retailer in fiscal 2020 or enter into joint ventures with other businesses develop new businesses internally as with homesense our additional us home store concept launched in fiscal 2018 launch or expand ecommerce platforms as we plan to do in fiscal 2022 with a homegoods ecommerce business and divest close or consolidate businesses failure to execute on mergers acquisitions investments divestitures closings and consolidations in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition acquisition investment or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses and we may not effectively evaluate target companies investments or investment partners or assess the risks benefits and costs of buying investing in or closing businesses or of the integration of acquired businesses all of which can be difficult timeconsuming and dilutive these activities may not meet our performance and other expectations and may expose us to unexpected or greaterthanexpected costs liabilities and risks in addition we recorded intangible assets and goodwill and the value of the tradenames in connection with our last acquisitions and may similarly do so in the future in connection with other acquisitions if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions we may be required to impair some or all of the goodwill associated with an acquisition which would adversely impact our results of operations and balance sheet such as with an impairment charge divestitures closings and consolidations could involve risks such as significant costs and obligations of closure including exposure on leases owned real estate and other contractual employment pension and severance obligations and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or as a result of the credit risk of an acquirer 

our real estate leases generally obligate us for long periods which subjects us to financial risks 

we lease virtually all of our store locations and either own or lease for long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices accordingly we are subject to the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate which can adversely affect our results while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions including by making specified payments we may not be able to terminate most of our leases if or when we would like to do so if we decide or are required to permanently close stores we are typically required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases which generally include among other things paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or paying to exercise rights to terminate and the performance of any of these obligations may be significant when we assign leases or sublease space to third parties or if we sell or close a business we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform as was the case with some of our former operations in addition when the lease terms for the stores in our ongoing operations expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to permanently close stores or to relocate stores within a market on less favorable terms or in a less favorable location 

failure to protect our inventory or other assets from loss and theft may impact our financial results 

risk of loss or theft of assets including inventory shrinkage is inherent in the retail business loss may be caused by error or misconduct of associates customers vendors or other third parties our inability to effectively prevent andor minimize the loss or theft of assets or to effectively reduce the impact of those losses could adversely affect our financial performance 

external and economic risks 

economic conditions on a global level or in particular markets geopolitical uncertainty and other factors creating uncertainty and instability may adversely affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending which could affect our financial performance 

consumer confidence and discretionary spending can be affected by various economic conditions both on a global level and in particular markets that can in turn affect our business or the retail industry generally these factors include among others economic recession unemployment levels availability of disposable income and actual and perceived wealth actual or perceived declines in consumer purchasing power health care costs costs of oil gas and other commodities interest rates and tax rates and related policies weakness in the housing market and housing costs volatility in capital markets credit availability and inflation and deflation 

similarly in addition to the impact of regulatory or policy changes regulatory volatility or uncertainty including in areas such as international trade including us tariff policies challenges presented by implementation following brexit as well as threats or occurrences of war terrorism pandemics or epidemics such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic geopolitical instability or uncertainty and political or social unrest andor conflict locally or across regions may have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending that can in turn affect our financial results and impact the retail industry generally these conditions and factors also shift trends in consumer spending that could affect our business although we believe our flexible offprice model helps us react to such changes they may adversely affect our sales cash flows merchandise orders and results of operations and performance 

instability in financial markets or other factors may adversely affect economic conditions on a global level or in particular markets impacting our sources of liquidity and costs of capital and increasing our financial exposure and our strategies for managing these financial risks may not be effective or sufficient 

global financial markets can experience volatility disruption and credit contraction which could adversely affect global economic conditions changes in economic conditions could adversely affect sources of liquidity available to us or our costs of capital including through capital markets could adversely affect plan asset values and investment performance and increase our pension liabilities expenses and funding requirements and other related financial exposure with respect to companysponsored and multiemployer pension plans our strategies for managing these financial risks and exposures may not be effective or sufficient or may expose us to risk 

our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions catastrophic events or public health crises 

natural or other disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other extreme weather climate conditions unforeseen public health issues such as pandemics and epidemics such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic fires or explosions and acts of war domestic or foreign terrorism or violence including riots or active shooter situations could disrupt our operations in a number of ways including by causing injury or serious harm to our associates including when traveling on business or customers severely damaging or destroying one or more of our stores distribution facilities data centers or office facilities or could disrupt the operations of or require the closure of one or more of our vendors or other parts of our supply chain located in the affected areas daytoday operations including our ability to receive products from our vendors or third party service providers or transport products to our stores or to our ecommerce customers could be adversely affected transportation to and from our stores by customers or associates could be limited or we could temporarily close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by affected distribution centers for a short or extended period of time as with closures of our stores and other facilities beginning in march 2020 

as our business is subject to seasonal influences a decrease in sales or margins a severe disruption or other significant event that impacts our business during the second half of the year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operating results 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we generally realize higher levels of sales and earnings in the second half of the year which includes the backtoschool and yearend holiday seasons any decrease in sales or margins or any significant adverse event during this period including those described in these risk factors could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations 

our results may be adversely affected by increased utility transportation or logistics costs reduced availability or increased cost of oil or other fuels or increased costs of other commodities 

energy and fuel costs can fluctuate dramatically and at times have resulted in significant cost increases particularly for the price of oil and gasoline an increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers although we typically enter into derivative instruments designed to manage a portion of our transportation costs a hedging strategy any such strategy may not be effective or sufficient and could result in increased operating costs increased regulation related to environmental costs including cap and trade carbon taxes or other emissions management systems could also adversely affect our costs of doing business including utility transportation and logistics costs as could other shortages or disruptions impacting transportation such as those relating to trucking and freight hauling for example in recent years increased freight cost related to labor equipment and capacity shortages as well as other factors had an impact on our margins and in fiscal 2021 the ongoing pandemic impacted operations of many third parties along our supply chain impacting our inventory flow and financial performance similarly other commodity prices can fluctuate dramatically such increases can impact the cost of merchandise which could adversely affect our performance through potentially reduced consumer demand or reduced margins 

adverse or unseasonable weather may adversely affect our sales and operating results 

adverse or unseasonable weather such as storms severe cold or heat or unseasonable temperatures even if not extreme may affect customers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop at all or in certain categories we offer particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise possibly impacting our sales and customer satisfaction with our stores and increasing our markdowns as a result our business could be adversely affected 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

sales made by our stores outside the us are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and changes in currency exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into us dollars for financial reporting purposes because of this movements in currency exchange rates have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our consolidated and segment results from time to time changes in currency exchange rates can also increase the cost of inventory purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the business buying the merchandise when exchange rates change significantly in a short period or move unfavorably over an extended period it can be difficult for us to adjust accordingly and gross margin can be adversely affected for example a significant amount of merchandise we offer for sale is made in china and accordingly a revaluation of chinese currency or increased market flexibility in the exchange rate for that currency increasing its value relative to the us dollar or currencies in which our stores are located could be significant 

additionally we routinely enter into inventoryrelated derivative instruments a hedging strategy to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rates on merchandise margins resulting from merchandise purchases by our segments denominated in currencies other than their local currencies in accordance with gaap we evaluate the fair value of these derivative instruments and make marktomarket adjustments at the end of each accounting period these adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our earnings 

we expect that currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations from time to time in addition fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our earnings and operating results if a counterparty to one of our hedging arrangements fails to perform 

regulatory legal and compliance risks 

failure to comply with laws rules regulations and orders and applicable accounting principles and interpretations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

we are subject to national state provincial regional and local laws rules regulations mandates accounting standards principles and interpretations as well as government orders in various countries in which we operate that collectively affect multiple aspects of our business we are also subject to new and changing laws rules and regulations mandates evolving interpretations of existing laws by judicial and regulatory authorities changes in accounting standards or interpretations and reforms in jurisdictions where we do business these requirements current or changing could adversely affect our operating results including those involving 

– labor and employment practices and benefits including for labor unions and works councils 

– health welfare and safety requirements such as those implemented in connection with the covid19 pandemic 

– importexport supply chain trade restrictions and logistics including resulting from changes to requirements or policies from the outcome of brexit 

– climate change energy and waste 

– consumer protection and product safety 

– marketing 

– financial regulations and reporting 

– tax 

– data protection and privacy such as to comply with or fines and penalties related to general data protection regulation in the european union and the california consumer privacy act 

– internet regulations including ecommerce electronic communications and privacy 

– protection of intellectual property rights and 

– compliance with governmental assistance programs 

complying with applicable laws rules regulations standards interpretations orders and our own internal policies may require us to spend additional time and resources to implement new procedures and other controls conduct audits train associates and third parties on our compliance methods or take other actions particularly as we continue to grow globally and enter new markets countries or product categories any of which could adversely impact our results particularly in a dynamic regulatory environment anticipated changes to laws and regulations may require us to invest in compliance efforts or otherwise expend resources before changes are certain 

in addition if we or third parties that perform services on our behalf fail to comply with applicable laws rules regulations standards interpretations and orders we may be subject to judgments fines or other costs or penalties which could adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition 

our results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation legal proceedings and other legal or regulatory matters 

we are involved or may in the future become involved in legal proceedings regulatory reviews audits and other legal matters these may involve inquiries investigations lawsuits and other proceedings by local provincial state and national governmental entities in the us and other countries and private plaintiffs including with respect to employment and employee benefits such as classification employment rights discrimination wage and hour and retaliation whistleblower claims harassment claims tax securities disclosure real estate environmental matters hazardous materials and hazardous waste tort business practices consumer protection privacydata security product safety and compliance advertising and intellectual property there continue to be employmentrelated and consumer protection lawsuits including putative class actions in the united states and we are subject to these types of suits we cannot predict the results of legal and regulatory proceedings with certainty and actual results may differ from any reserves we establish estimating the probable outcome regardless of merit or outcome these proceedings can be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expense and diversion of management attention legal regulatory and other proceedings could expose us to significant defense costs fines penalties and liability to private parties and governmental entities for monetary recoveries and other amounts and attorneys’ fees andor require us to change aspects of our operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

quality safety or other issues with merchandise we buy and sell could impact our reputation sales and financial results 

various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we import transport and sell to consumers regulations and standards in this area including federal regulations related to the us consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 and the us food safety modernization act state regulations like california’s proposition 65 and similar legislation in other countries in which we operate impose restrictions and requirements on the merchandise we buy and sell these regulations change from time to time and new national state provincial or local regulations in the us and other countries that may affect our business are contemplated and enacted with some regularity we rely on our vendors to provide quality merchandise that complies with applicable laws as well as our vendor code of conduct that requires our merchandise vendors to ensure the products they sell to us comply with all applicable laws and regulations however our vendors may not comply with such obligations if we or our merchandise vendors are unable to comply with regulatory requirements on a timely basis or at all or to adequately monitor new regulations that may apply to existing or new merchandise categories or in new geographies we could incur significant fines or penalties or we could have to curtail some aspects of our sales or operations which could have an adverse effect on our financial results although our arrangements with our vendors frequently provide for indemnification for product liabilities the vendors may fail to honor these obligations to an extent we consider sufficient or at all in certain circumstances we may bear some responsibility for compliance with applicable product safety laws labeling requirements and other applicable laws in addition failure to comply with or the perception that we have failed to comply with other social compliance product labor andor environmental standards or monitoring practices which continue to evolve related to the products we sell could subject us reputational harm and impact our financial results 

concerns or issues with the quality safety and sourcing of merchandise particularly with products subject to increased levels of regulation or inquiry or the authenticity of merchandise regardless of whether unverified or not our fault could result in regulatory civil or criminal fines or penalties litigation or reputational harm any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including the results of tax audits and examinations income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory income tax rates changes in income tax rates changes in transfer pricing changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in applicable tax legislation regulations treaties and other guidance and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “2017 tax act” significantly revised the previous federal income tax code additional interpretive guidance has been and will continue to be issued with respect to the 2017 tax act and such guidance may be different from our interpretation and thus adversely affect our results in addition it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the 2017 tax act which could also impact our tax obligations significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision and accruals for taxes and actual results may differ from our estimations 

in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by national state provincial and local tax authorities in the us and foreign countries and the examining authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various proceedings which are at various stages with such authorities with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these proceedings to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of our provision for income taxes and we increase and decrease our provision as a result of these assessments however developments in and actual results of proceedings rulings or settlements by or with tax authorities or courts including due to changes in facts law or legal interpretations expiration of applicable statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions could result in amounts that differ from those we have accrued for such proceedings in either a positive or a negative manner which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations in addition we are subject to tax audits and examinations for payroll value added salesbased and other taxes relating to our businesses which could adversely impact our financial results

overview 

we are the leading offprice apparel and home fashions retailer in the us and worldwide our mission is to deliver great value to our customers every day we do this by selling a rapidly changing assortment of apparel home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20 to 60 below fullprice retailers’ including department specialty and major online retailers regular prices on comparable merchandise every day we operate over 4500 stores through our four main segments in the us marmaxx which operates tj maxx marshalls tjmaxxcom and marshallscom and homegoods which operates homegoods and homesense tjx canada which operates winners homesense and marshalls in canada and tjx international which operates tk maxx homesense and tkmaxxcom in europe and tk maxx in australia in addition to our four main segments sierra operates sierracom and retail stores in the us the results of sierra are included in the marmaxx segment 

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

after a novel coronavirus disease “covid19” emerged and spread worldwide the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic in march 2020 and national state and local governments and private entities began issuing various restrictions including travel restrictions restrictions on public gatherings stay at home orders and advisories and quarantine or isolation protocols we temporarily closed all of our stores online businesses distribution centers and offices in march 2020 with associates working remotely where possible during april 2020 we temporarily furloughed the majority of hourly store and distribution center associates in the us and canada with employee benefits coverage for eligible associates continuing during the temporary furlough at no cost to impacted associates we also took comparable actions with respect to portions of our european and australian workforces 

when we began to reopen stores and distribution centers in may 2020 we implemented new health and safety practices including practices related to personal protective equipment enhanced cleaning and social distancing protocols early in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 in response to increasing cases of covid19 hundreds of our stores had additional temporary closures the vast majority being in europe and canada and additional stores may close temporarily in the future we continue to monitor developments including government requirements and recommendations at the national state and local level that could result in possible additional impacts to our operations 

our results for fiscal 2021 were negatively impacted by the temporary closure of our stores for approximately 24 of fiscal 2021 in the aggregate this represents total store days closed due to the covid19 pandemic as a percentage of potential total store days open see additional details below by segment 



as of march 30 2021 we had approximately 580 stores primarily in europe that were temporarily closed due to government mandates in response to the covid19 global pandemic we expect closures in europe and canada to impact our first quarter fiscal 2022 results as stores are expected to be closed for approximately 71 and 12 of the quarter respectively although the majority of our germany and netherlands stores were reopened by the end of march additional operating restrictions have been imposed including appointment requirements limited business hours and capacity constraints in total based on current restrictions we expect stores to be closed for approximately 12 of the first quarter of fiscal 2022 all of our ecommerce businesses remain open including tkmaxxcom in the uk 

in addition to the temporary closures and reopenings of our stores and other facilities the ongoing covid19 pandemic has led to modifications to our operations including the implementation of health and safety protocols and has impacted consumer behavior the continued scope and impact of the pandemic is unpredictable and has in the past caused currently causes and may continue to cause additional intermittent or prolonged periods of temporary store closures and may result in additional changes in consumer demand and behavior or require further modifications to our operations these potential impacts may lead to increased asset recovery and valuation risks such as impairment of our stores and other assets and an inability to realize deferred tax assets due to sustaining losses in certain jurisdictions the uncertainties in the global economy may also impact the financial viability or business operations of some of our suppliers and service providers including transportation and logistics providers which may interrupt our supply chain and require other changes to our operations these and other factors have had and may continue to have a material impact on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

store and associate actions 

we have taken numerous steps designed to protect the health and wellbeing of our associates and customers to operate more safely in light of the covid19 pandemic we established several global task force teams focused on a broad range of strategies to navigate the company through this global health crisis globally we have put in place practices including social distancing protocols which include occupancy limits and reducing instore inventory levels access to personal protective equipment and enhanced cleaning efforts for example upon reopening our stores we installed protective shields at registers encouraged social distancing through regular instore announcements signage and markers in our queue lines implemented new processes for handling merchandise returns and instituted new cleaning regimens including enhanced cleaning of hightouch surfaces such as shopping carts throughout the day further in many locations including where mandated we have required that shoppers wear a face covering in stores 

financial actions 

balance sheet cash flow and liquidity 

the temporary closure of our stores had a material impact on our results of operations financial position and liquidity as further detailed below in results of operations  this impact included a 23 decrease in net sales for fiscal 2021 compared to the same period last year resulting in a significant decline in net profit for the full fiscal year 

during fiscal 2021 we generated 46 billion of operating cash flows and ended the year with 105 billion of cash in addition we increased our borrowing capacity by entering into a 500 million 364 day revolving credit facility making a total of 15 billion available to us under revolving credit facilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 tjx issued 4 billion aggregate principal amount of notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we issued 1 billion in aggregate principal amount of notes and accepted 11 billion in combined aggregate principal amount of certain of its notes issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 pursuant to cash tender offers we paid 14 billion aggregate consideration including transaction costs and recorded a 03 billion pretax loss on the early extinguishment for the accepted notes for additional information on the new credit facility and debt transactions see note k—longterm debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements 

we intend to continue to be prudent with our expenses for fiscal 2022 capital spending for fiscal 2022 is expected to be back in line with normal spending and is expected to be in the range of 12 billion to 14 billion with incremental investments in our infrastructure and our distribution centers both existing and new facilities we are planning approximately 120 net store openings for fiscal 2022 we have currently suspended our share repurchase program while our board of directors did not declare a dividend in the first nine months of fiscal 2021 we declared a dividend of 026 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 paid in march 2021 we also declared a similar dividend of 026 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 

during fiscal 2021 we negotiated rent deferrals primarily for second quarter lease payments for a significant number of our stores with repayment at later dates primarily in fiscal 2022 we elected to treat the covid19 pandemicrelated rent deferrals as a resolution of a contingency by remeasuring the lease liability with a corresponding offset to the rightofuse asset using the remeasured consideration in addition to negotiating deferral of lease payments we had temporarily extended payment terms on merchandise orders which increased our accounts payable as of the end of the fiscal year benefiting our operating cash flows as payment terms are reduced and we make deferred payments we expect our operating cash flows to be negatively impacted 

we evaluated the value of our inventory in light of the temporary store closures in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 due to the covid19 pandemic permanent markdowns which had been or will be taken upon reopening of the stores on transitional or out of season merchandise and merchandise that was already in markdown status combined with the writeoff of perishable goods resulted in a reduction of approximately 04 billion in inventory for fiscal 2021 additional markdowns recorded throughout the year were taken in the ordinary course of business operations 

given the substantial reduction in our sales and the reduced cash flow projections as a result of the temporary store closures during fiscal 2021 due to the covid19 pandemic we determined that triggering events had occurred and that impairment assessments were warranted for certain stores this resulted in impairment charges of 72 million for fiscal 2021  related to operating lease right of use assets and store fixed assets 

operating expenses 

we incurred additional payroll costs associated with monitoring occupancy limits to comply with social distancing protocols and implementing enhanced cleaning regimens in our stores distribution centers and offices in addition we provided discretionary appreciation bonuses during fiscal 2021 to store and distribution center associates and incurred incremental costs for personal protective equipment and additional cleaning supplies we expect that many of these costs will continue in fiscal 2022 we have implemented and plan to continue to implement cost saving initiatives to reduce some ongoing variable and discretionary spending 

in response to the covid19 pandemic governments in the us uk canada and various other jurisdictions have implemented programs to encourage companies to retain and pay employees who are unable to work or are limited in the work that they can perform in light of closures or a significant decline in sales throughout fiscal 2021 we continued to qualify for certain of these provisions which partially offset related expenses during fiscal 2021  these programs reduced our expenses by approximate ly 05 billion on our consolidated statements of income 

results of operations 

matters affecting comparability 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic our stores were closed in the aggregate for approximately 24 of fiscal 2021 in addition to lost revenues we continued to pay wages and provide benefits to many of our associates during the closures and incurred incremental operating expenses upon reopening for new health and safety practices this significantly impacted the operating results of all of our divisions and our expense ratios as compared to the prior year 

highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2021 include the following 

– net sales decreased 23 to 321 billion for fiscal 2021 versus fiscal 2020 sales of 417 billion as of january 30 2021 the number of stores in operation including stores that had been temporarily closed due to covid19 increased 1 and selling square footage increased 1 compared to the end of fiscal 2020 

– diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2021 were 007 versus 267 per share in fiscal 2020 

– pretax margin the ratio of pretax income to net sales for fiscal 2021 was 03 a 103 percentage point decrease compared with 106 in fiscal 2020 

– the debt extinguishment charge of 03 billion reduced fiscal 2021 pretax margin by 10 percentage point and reduced earnings per share by 019 per share 

– our cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs ratio for fiscal 2021 was 763 a 48 percentage point increase compared with 715 in fiscal 2020 

– our selling general and administrative “sga” expense ratio for fiscal 2021 was 218 a 39 percentage point increase compared with 179 in fiscal 2020 

– our consolidated average per store inventories including inventory on hand at our distribution centers which excludes inventory in transit and excluding our ecommerce sites and sierra stores were down 21 on a reported basis and down 22 on a constant currency basis at the end of fiscal 2021 as compared to a 4 increase in average per store inventories on both a reported and constant currency basis at the end of fiscal 2020 

– there were no dividends declared during the first nine months of fiscal 2021 and share repurchases were suspended in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 a dividend of 026 per share was declared in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and paid in march of 2021 see the impact of the covid19 pandemic section above for the actions taken regarding our share repurchase programs 

recent events and trends 

covid19 

see discussion above in the impact of the covid19 pandemic section 

impact of brexit 

on december 24 2020 the uk and eu agreed upon the terms of their future trading relationship as expected the movement of goods between the uk and eu is subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements which is expected to have a negative impact on our ability to efficiently move merchandise in the region we have realigned our european divisions supply chain to reduce the volume of merchandise flowing between the uk and the eu and have established resources and systems to support this plan 

the new trade deal provides for zero customs duties and zero quotas on trade between the uk and the eu in goods that are produced in each of the uk and the eu however a proportion of the merchandise we source in the uk and the eu is produced somewhere else in the world and therefore will be subject to additional customs duty costs under the new trade deal these additional customs duties and the related operational costs are likely to impact the profitability of our european division at least in the short term 

new immigration requirements between the uk and eu countries may also have a negative impact on our ability to recruit and retain current and future talent in the region we continue to communicate with our associates about the new immigration requirements 

in addition to these operational impacts factors including changes in legislation consumer confidence and behavior economic conditions interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could result in a significant financial impact to our european operations particularly in the short term 

net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2021 totaled 321 billion a 23 decrease over fiscal 2020 the decrease in net sales was driven by temporary store closures as a result of the covid19 pandemic and lower customer traffic with stores closed in the aggregate for approximately 24 of fiscal 2021 net sales from our ecommerce businesses combined amounted to approximately 3 of total sales 

as a result of the extended store closures due to the covid19 pandemic and our policy relating to the treatment of extended store closures when calculating comp store sales under our historical definition we had no stores classified as comp stores at the end of fiscal 2021 

in order to provide a performance indicator for our stores as they reopened since the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we have been temporarily reporting a new sales measure openonly comp store sales openonly comp store sales includes stores initially classified as comp stores at the beginning of fiscal 2021 that have had to temporarily close due to the covid19 pandemic this measure reports the sales increase or decrease of these stores for the days the stores were open in the current period against sales for the same days in the prior year openonly comp sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year using the prior year’s exchange rates our historical definition of comp store sales is presented below for reference 

openonly comp store sales were down 4 for fiscal 2021 as compared to last year these results reflect a decrease in customer traffic partially offset by an increased average basket across all divisions our stores were closed in the aggregate for approximately 24 of fiscal 2021 home fashion across all major segments outperformed apparel for fiscal 2021 

we define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores and average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold we define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions 

historical definition of comp store sales 

we are temporarily reporting a new sales measure openonly comp store sales as described above the following reflects the way that we have historically classified and reported comp sales results 

historically we defined comparable store sales or comp sales to be sales of stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation we calculated comp sales on a 52week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp percentage is immaterial 

sales excluded from comp sales “noncomp sales” consist of sales from 

– new stores  stores that have not yet met the comp sales criteria which represents a substantial majority of noncomp sales 

– stores that are closed permanently or for an extended period of time 

– sales from our ecommerce sites meaning sierracom tjmaxxcom marshallscom and tkmaxxcom 

we determine which stores are included in the comp sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year beginning in fiscal 2020 sierra stores that otherwise fit the comp store definition are included in comp stores in our marmaxx segment 

comp sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year’s comp sales using the prior year’s exchange rates this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance 

comp sales may be referred to as “same store” sales by other retail companies the method for calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry therefore our measure of comp sales may not be comparable to that of other retail companies 

operating results as a percentage of net sales 

the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales 



 figures may not foot due to rounding 

revenues by geography 

the percentages of our consolidated revenues by geography for the last two fiscal years are as follows 



impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the us dollar or a division’s local currency in relation to other currencies we specifically refer to “foreign currency” as the impact of translational foreign currency exchange and marktomarket of inventory derivatives as described in detail below this does not include the impact foreign currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division’s local currency referred to as “transactional foreign exchange” also described below 

translation foreign exchange 

in our consolidated financial statements we translate the operations of tjx canada and tjx international from local currencies into us dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in net sales net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments currency translation generally does not affect operating margins or affects them only slightly as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period 

marktomarket inventory derivatives 

we routinely enter into inventoryrelated hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions principally tjx canada and tjx international as we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments as defined by us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we record a marktomarket gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period in subsequent periods the marktomarket gain or loss is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for while these effects occur every reporting period they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time the marktomarket gain or loss on these derivatives does not affect net sales but it does affect the cost of sales operating margins and net income 

transactional foreign exchange 

when discussing the impact on our results of the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on certain transactions we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange” this primarily includes the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on the yearoveryear comparison of merchandise margin as well as “foreign currency gains and losses” on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the operating divisions local currency these two items can impact segment margin comparison of our foreign divisions and we have highlighted them when they are meaningful to understanding operating trends 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs was 245 billion or 763 of net sales for fiscal 2021 compared to 298 billion or 715 of net sales for fiscal 2020 

the main reason for the decrease in the total cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs was the reduction in cost of merchandise sold due to a reduction in net sales as compared to the prior year primarily due to our stores being temporarily closed in the aggregate for approximately 24 of fiscal 2021 

the increase in the expense ratio of 48 for fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by the impact of lower sales primarily as a result of temporary store closures a significant portion of our occupancy costs are fixed and although we negotiated rent deferrals to help with our liquidity our occupancy costs were comparable to last year but increased the expense ratio by approximately 21 percentage points due to the lower sales volume our distribution costs increased the expense ratio by approximately 16 percentage points due to processing more units while our merchandise mix had a lower average ticket in addition distribution costs reflect wage increases discretionary appreciation bonuses and incremental costs to implement and maintain health and safety protocols despite a reduction in payroll costs due to associate furloughs in the first half of fiscal 2021 and 78 million in benefits received from government programs available in the us canada the uk and various other jurisdictions merchandise margin was negatively impacted by increased markdowns as a percentage of net sales as well as increased freight costs partially offset by strong markon the increased markdowns include those taken to revalue inventories due to our temporary store closures 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga expenses were 7 billion or 218 of net sales for fiscal 2021 compared to 75 billion or 179 of net sales for fiscal 2020 

the increase in sga expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by store payroll and store supply costs which negatively impacted the expense ratio by 27 percentage points these costs were primarily covidrelated including incremental store payroll investments to allow for enhanced cleaning and monitoring capacity discretionary appreciation bonuses and personal protective equipment for our associates these incremental costs were partially offset by expense savings including lower advertising and travel spend as well as other variable store costs such as credit processing fees which were lower as a result of the temporary store closures due to the covid19 pandemic we also paid certain associates during the temporary store closures which was partially offset by 434 million from government programs available in the us canada the uk and various other jurisdictions 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

on november 30 2020 we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 1150 notes due 2028 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 1600 notes due 2031 we used the proceeds to partially fund the purchase on december 4 2020 of 365 million of our 4500 notes due 2050 and 754 million of our 3875 notes due 2030 that were tendered and accepted in our cash tender offer we recorded a pretax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of 312 million for additional information on the debt transactions see note k—longterm debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements 

interest expense net 

the components of interest expense net for the last two fiscal years are summarized below 



net interest expense increased for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily driven by the issuance of additional debt in fiscal 2021 due to the covid19 pandemic and lower interest income in addition fiscal 2021 included interest expense on the 1 billion of borrowings on the revolving credit facilities which were paid off in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 

provision for income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 14 for fiscal 2021 compared to 257 for fiscal 2020 the decrease in the fiscal 2021 effective income tax rate is primarily driven by the negative impact of the covid19 pandemic to our results and the change in the jurisdictional mix of income and losses 

net income and diluted earnings per share 

net income was 01 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to 33 billion in fiscal 2020 diluted earnings per share were 007 in fiscal 2021 and 267 in fiscal 2020 the loss on early extinguishment of debt reduced net income by 229 million or 019 per share for the twelve months ended january 30 2021 

our stock repurchase programs which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding had no impact on our earnings per share in fiscal 2021 as we suspended the program in march 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic our stock repurchase programs benefited our earnings per share growth by approximately 3 in fiscal 2020 

segment information 

we operate four main business segments our marmaxx segment tj maxx marshalls tjmaxxcom and marshallscom and the homegoods segment homegoods and homesense both operate in the united states our tjx canada segment operates winners homesense and marshalls in canada and our tjx international segment operates tk maxx homesense and tkmaxxcom in europe and tk maxx in australia in addition to our four main segments sierra operates sierracom and retail stores in the us the results of sierra are included in the marmaxx segment 

we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest expense net and certain separately disclosed unusual or infrequent items “segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities the terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales these measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 

due to the temporary closing of all of our stores as a result of the covid19 pandemic our historical definition of comp store sales is not applicable for the reported periods in order to provide a performance indicator for our stores as they reopen since the second quarter of fiscal 2021 we have been temporarily reporting a new sales measure openonly comp store sales openonly comp store sales includes stores initially classified as comp stores at the beginning of fiscal 2021 that have had to temporarily close due to the covid19 pandemic this measure reports the sales increase or decrease of these stores for the days the stores were open in the current period against sales for the same days in the prior year 

presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments 

us segments 

marmaxx 



net sales 

net sales for marmaxx decreased 25 for fiscal 2021 as compared to last year the decrease in net sales was primarily due to the temporary closures of all stores as a result of the covid19 pandemic the stores were closed for approximately 20 of fiscal 2021 in addition the decrease in net sales was due to lower customer traffic partially offset by an increase in the average basket openonly comp store sales were down 7 for fiscal 2021 home fashions outperformed apparel for fiscal 2021 

segment profit 

segment profit was 09 billion for fiscal 2021 a decrease of 26 billion compared to a segment profit of 35 billion for fiscal 2020

during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 marmaxx made online shopping available at wwwmarshallscom along with wwwtjmaxxcom which was launched previously our us ecommerce businesses which represented approximately 3 of marmaxx’s net sales for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 did not have a significant impact on yearoveryear segment margin comparisons along with our stores we temporarily closed our online businesses for a portion of fiscal 2021 as a result of the covid19 pandemic

general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments general corporate expenses are primarily included in sga expenses the marktomarket adjustment of our fuel hedges is included in cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs 

the decrease in general corporate expense for fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by lower sharebased and incentive compensation costs 

analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations supplemented as needed by shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper as of january 30 2021 there were no shortterm bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding 

as part of the actions we have taken and are continuing to take relating to the covid19 pandemic as described in impact of the covid19 pandemic above and in note b—impact of the covid19 pandemic of notes to consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 tjx issued 4 billion aggregate principal amount of notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we refinanced 11 billion in aggregate principal amount of our higher interest notes with the issuance and sale of 1 billion in aggregate principal amount of lower interest rate senior notes for additional information on these transactions see note k—longterm debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements 

in march 2020 we drew down 1 billion on our revolving credit facilities subsequently repaying these borrowings in july 2020 on august 10 2020 we increased our borrowing capacity by entering into a 500 million 364day facility making a total of 15 billion available to us under revolving credit facilities see note k—longterm debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details of these transactions 

no dividend was declared in the first nine months of fiscal 2021 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 026 per share paid in march 2021 w e declared a similar dividend of 026 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we have currently suspended our share repurchase program 

we qualified for certain government programs in the us the uk canada and other jurisdictions to support payroll and other operating cost s we also reduced spending more broadly across the company reducing capital spending evaluating operating expenses and taking actions to reduce ongoing variable and discretionary spending w e negotiated rent deferrals for fiscal 2021 for a significant amount of our stores primarily for second quarter lease payments with repayment at later dates primarily in fiscal 2022 in addition to negotiating deferral of lease payments we also temporarily extended payment terms on merchandise orders which increased our accounts payable as of the end of the fiscal year benefiting our operating cash flows as payment terms are reduced and we make deferred payments we expect our operating cash flows to be negatively impacted th e challenges posed by the covid19 pandemic on our business continue to evolve consequently we will continue to evaluate our financial position in light of future developments particularly those relating to the covid19 pandemic 

we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents internally generated funds and our credit facilities described in note k—longterm debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements are adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year 

we may use operating cash flow and cash on hand to repay portions of our indebtedness depending on prevailing market conditions liquidity requirements existing economic conditions contractual restrictions and other factors as such we may from time to time seek to retire redeem prepay or purchase our outstanding debt through redemptions cash purchases prepayments refinancings andor exchanges in open market purchases privately negotiated transactions by tender offer or otherwise if we use our operating cash flow andor cash on hand to repay our debt it will reduce the amount of cash available for additional capital expenditures 

as of january 30 2021 tjx held 105 billion in cash approximately 12 billion of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with 08 billion held in countries where we intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings tjx has provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in canada puerto rico italy india hong kong and vietnam through january 30 2021 if we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 46 billion in fiscal 2021 and 41 billion in fiscal 2020 our operating cash flows increased by 05 billion compared to fiscal 2020 the covid19 pandemic had a material impact on our operating cash flows the loss of sales as a result of temporarily closing our stores and ecommerce businesses resulted in net income of 01 billion for the twelve month period ended january 30 2021 compared with net income o f 33 billion in the twelve month period ended february 1 2020 this decrease in cash flows was more than offset by the combination of a 21 billion favorable impact from the increase in accounts payable a 09 billion favorable impact due to the decrease in merchandise inventories as well as a 06 billion favorable impact due to the increases in accrued expenses income taxes payable and lease liabilities the favorable impact of the change in merchandise inventories net of accounts payable was driven by the timing of payments for merchandise sold and lower inventories 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 06 billion in fiscal 2021 and 15 billion in fiscal 2020 the cash outflows for both periods were primarily driven by capital expenditures and in fiscal 2020 we invested 02 billion in familia an established offprice apparel and home fashion retail chain in russia 

net cash used in investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two fiscal years as set forth in the table below 



we expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2022 will be in the range of approximately 12 billion to 14 billion including approximately 07 billion to 08 billion for our offices and distribution centers including buying and merchandising systems and other information systems to support growth approximately 04 billion to 05 billion for store renovations and approximately 01 billion for new stores we plan to fund these expenditures with our existing cash balances and through internally generated funds 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities resulted in net cash inflows of 32 billion in fiscal 2021 and net cash outflows of 24 billion in fiscal 2020 in fiscal 2021 these cash inflows were primarily driven by debt transactions in fiscal 2020 the cash outflows were primarily driven by equity repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by issuances of common stock 

debt 

the cash inflows in fiscal 2021 were a result of completing the issuance and sale in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 of a 125 billion aggregate principal amount of 3500 notes due 2025 b 075 billion aggregate principal amount of 3750 notes due 2027 c 125 billion aggregate principal amount of 3875 notes due 2030 and d 075 billion aggregate principal amount of 4500 notes due 2050 in addition in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we drew down 1 billion on our previously undrawn revolving credit facilities which were paid off in full during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 during the fourth quarter we issued 1 billion in aggregate principal amount of notes and accepted 11 billion in combined aggregate principal amount of certain of our notes issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 pursuant to cash tender offers we paid 14 billion aggregate consideration in connection with the tender offers including transaction costs and recorded a 312 million pretax loss on the early extinguishment for the accepted notes see note k—longterm debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

equity 

under our stock repurchase programs during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 tjx paid 02 billion to repurchase and subsequently retired 34 million shares of our stock on a settlement basis these outflows were offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options net of shares withheld for taxes in fiscal 2021  under our stock repurchase programs tjx spent 16 billion to repurchase 282 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2020 for further information regarding equity repurchases see note e—capital stock and earnings per share of notes to consolidated financial statements 

in february 2020 tjx announced that its board of directors had approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional 15 billion of tjx common stock from time to time i n march 2020 in connection with the actions taken related to the cov id19 pandemic as described in impact of the covid19 pandemic above and in note b—impact of the covid19 pandemic of notes to consolidated financial statements we suspended our share repurchase program 

dividends 

in march 2020 we paid our quarterly dividend declared in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 which totaled 03 billion  as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic n o dividends were declared in the first nine months of fiscal 2021 the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 026 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 paid in march 2021 we also declared a similar dividend of 026 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 tjx declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 092 per share in fiscal 2020 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 03 billion in fiscal 2021 and 11 billion in fiscal 2020 we also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 02 billion in both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 

contractual obligations 

as of january 30 2021 we had known contractual obligations under longterm debt arrangements including current installments other longterm obligations operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows 



a includes estimated interest costs 

b operating lease liabilities exclude legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced and include options to extend lease terms that are now deemed reasonably certain of being exercised according to our lease accounting policy the balances do not include variable costs for insurance real estate taxes other operating expenses and in some cases rentals based on a percentage of sales these items totaled approximately onethird of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2021 

c includes estimated obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items products and services used in our business including executive employment and other agreements excludes agreements that can be canceled without penalty 

we also have longterm liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include 680 million for employee compensation and benefits and 264 million for uncertain tax positions 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap which requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to the areas described below 

inventory valuation 

we use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except tk maxx in australia the businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale ie inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced typically a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns however as a normal business practice we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods however we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end we do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory 

impairment of longlived assets 

we evaluate our longlived assets inclusive of operating lease right of use assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores which involve a number of factors including historical trends recent performance and general economic assumptions if we determine that an impairment has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets we estimate fair value by obtaining market appraisals or using other valuation techniques 

lease accounting 

operating leases are included in “operating lease right of use assets” “current portion of operating lease liabilities” and “longterm operating lease liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets right of use “rou” assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease at the inception of the arrangement we determine if an arrangement is a lease based on assessment of the terms and conditions of the contract operating lease rou assets and lease liabilities are recognized at possession date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term the majority of our leases are retail store locations and the possession date is typically 30 to 60 days prior to the opening of the store and generally occurs before the commencement of the lease term as specified in the lease our lessors do not provide an implicit rate nor is one readily available therefore we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at possession date in determining the present value of future lease payments the incremental borrowing rate is calculated based on the us consumer discretionary yield curve and adjusted for collateralization and foreign currency impact for tjx international and tjx canada leases the operating lease rou asset also includes any acquisition costs offset by lease incentives our lease terms include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term within “cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs” 

reserves for uncertain tax positions 

similar to many large corporations our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation assessment examination litigation and settlement the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain in accordance with gaap we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the positions we have taken will not be sustained however in the next twelve months and in future periods the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay as the result of the final resolutions of examinations judicial or administrative proceedings changes in facts law or legal interpretations expiration of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of or changes in tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

loss contingencies 

certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our management with the assistance of our legal counsel assesses such contingent liabilities such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements related to income taxes see note a—basis of presentation and summary of accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k including the dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations financial position or cash flows we do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tjx is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business some potential market risks are discussed below 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the us dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations our currency risk primarily relates to our activity in the canadian dollar british pound and euro as more fully described in note f—financial instruments of notes to consolidated financial statements we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments primarily at our international operations and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international operations we enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries our foreign exchange risk management policy prohibits us from using derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use any leveraged derivative financial instruments we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency the analysis indicated a potential impact of approximately 38 million on our pretax income in fiscal 2021 and approximately 82 million in fiscal 2020 

equity price and other market risk 

the assets of our funded qualified pension plan a portion of which are equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets we invest the pension assets described further in note j—pension plans and other retirement benefits of notes to consolidated financial statements in a manner that attempts to manage our exposure to market uncertainties investments in general are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility risks a significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan resulting in increased required contributions to the plan or other planrelated liabilities our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes

our general practice is to renovate and upgrade our stores across our retail banners to enhance our customers’ shopping experience and help drive sales although we offer a selfservice format we train our store associates to provide friendly and helpful customer service and seek to staff our stores to deliver a positive shopping experience we typically offer customerfriendly return policies we accept a variety of payment methods including cash credit cards and debit cards we also offer tjxbranded credit cards in the us through a bank but do not own the customer receivables 

distribution 

we operate distribution centers encompassing approximately 19 million square feet in six countries these centers are generally large and built to suit our specific offprice business model with a combination of automated systems and manual processes to manage the variety of merchandise we acquire we ship substantially all of our merchandise to our stores through a network of distribution centers and warehouses as well as shipping centers operated by third parties 

store growth 

expansion of our business through the addition of new stores continues to be an important part of our global growth strategy the following table provides store growth information for our four major segments for the two most recently completed fiscal years as well as our estimates of the longterm store growth potential of these segments in their current geographies

some of our home fashion stores are colocated with one of our apparel stores in a combo or superstore format we count each of the stores in the combo or superstore format as a separate store 

competition 

the retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive we compete on the basis of numerous factors including brand fashion price quality selection and freshness instore and online service and shopping experience reputation and store location we compete with local regional national and international department specialty offprice discount warehouse and outlet stores as well as other retailers that sell apparel home fashions and other merchandise that we sell whether in stores online through catalogs or other media channels

 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks that follow are those that we think individually or in the aggregate could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements 

failure to execute our opportunistic buying strategy and inventory management could adversely affect our results 

opportunistic buying operating with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are key elements of our offprice business strategy but subject us to risks related to the pricing quantity mix nature and timing of inventory flowing to our stores our merchants are in the marketplace frequently as much of our merchandise is purchased for the current or immediately upcoming season and our focus on buying opportunistically places considerable discretion with them our business model expects our merchants to effectively react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market assess the desirability and value of merchandise and generally make determinations of how and what we source as well as when and from where we source it if we do not obtain the right merchandise at the right times in the right quantities at the right prices and in the right mix our customer traffic as well as our sales and margins could be adversely affected 

we base our purchases of inventory in part on our sales forecasts if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand either of which could adversely affect our financial performance 

if we are unable to generally purchase inventory at prices sufficiently below prices paid by conventional retailers we may not be able to maintain a sufficient overall pricing differential to fullprice retailers including department specialty and major online retailers and our ability to attract customers or sustain our margins may be adversely affected we may not achieve this pricing differential at various times or in some reporting segments chains product categories or geographies which could adversely affect our results 

to respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns we need to appropriately allocate and deliver merchandise to our stores maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store and be flexible in our allocation of floor space at our stores among product categories if we are not able to do so our ability to attract and retain customers and our results could be adversely affected 

failure to continue to expand our business and operations successfully or to manage our substantial size and scale effectively could adversely affect our financial results 

our growth strategy includes successfully expanding within our current markets and into new geographic regions product lines and channels and as appropriate adding new businesses whether by development investment or acquisition managing growth effectively can be difficult if any aspect of our expansion strategy does not achieve the success we expect in whole or in part we may fail to meet our financial performance expectations andor may be required to increase investments slow our planned growth or close stores or operations various circumstances could adversely affect our expansion plans for example if we are not able to find and lease appropriate real estate on attractive terms in the locations where we seek to open stores we may need to change our planned growth in those areas similarly new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores whether in current or new markets our financial performance in new markets may not be the same as in existing markets and adding stores or banners to existing markets may otherwise adversely affect our sales and profitability in those markets 

further our substantial size can make it challenging to manage our complex operations effectively and to maintain appropriate internal resources and third party providers to support our business effectively these challenges increase as we grow our business and may add pressure to management and to various functions across our business including administration systems including information technology systems merchandising store operations distribution logistics and compliance increasing our size and complexity may also put additional pressure on appropriately staffing and training associates in these areas andor managing appropriate third party providers that support these areas the large size and scale of our operations our multiple banners and locations across the us canada europe and australia and the autonomy afforded to the banners in some aspects of the business also increase the risk that our systems controls practices and policies may not be implemented effectively or consistently throughout our company and that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations these risks may increase as we continue to grow particularly if we expand into additional countries if business information is not shared effectively or if we are otherwise unable to manage our size or growth effectively our business may be adversely affected or we may need to reduce the rate of expansion or otherwise curtail growth which may adversely affect our business plans sales and results 

failure to identify consumer trends and preferences or to otherwise meet customer demand in new or existing markets or channels could negatively impact our performance 

as our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand and expectations we work to identify consumer trends and preferences on an ongoing basis and to offer inventory and shopping experiences that meet those trends and preferences however we may not do so effectively and on a timely basis across our diverse merchandise categories and in each of the many markets in the us canada europe and australia in which we do business trends and preferences in markets may differ from what we anticipate although our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer preferences and trends for example by expanding and contracting merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes we may not successfully do so which could add difficulty in attracting new customers retaining existing customers and encouraging frequent customer visits and could adversely affect our results 

customers may also have expectations about how they shop in stores or through ecommerce or more generally engage with businesses across different channels for example through various digital platforms which expectations may vary across demographics and geographies and may evolve rapidly meeting these expectations effectively involves identifying the right opportunities and making the right investments at the right time and with the right speed among other things and failure to do so may impact our financial results 

if we fail to successfully implement our various marketing efforts or if our competitors’ programs are more effective than ours our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise may be influenced by our marketing efforts although we use marketing to drive customer traffic through various media including television radio print outdoor digitalsocial media email mobile and direct mail some of our competitors expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage further we may not effectively implement strategies with respect to rapidly evolving digital communication channels our programs may not be or remain effective or could require increased expenditures which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the retail apparel and home fashion businesses are highly competitive we compete with local regional national and international retailers that sell apparel home fashions and other merchandise that we sell including retailers that operate through stores ecommerce catalogues andor other media or channels some of our competitors are larger than we are or have more experience in selling certain product lines or through certain channels than we do new competitors frequently enter the market additionally existing competitors enter or increase their presence in markets in which we operate may consolidate with other retailers and may expand their merchandise offerings add new sales channels or change their pricing strategies all of which affect the competitive landscape which can be volatile consumer spending online has increased and may continue to increase while our business is primarily in stores we compete on the basis of various factors affecting value meaning the combination of brand fashion price and quality as well as merchandise selection and freshness banner name recognition and appeal both instore and online service and shopping experience convenience and store location if we fail to compete effectively our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 

economic conditions on a global level or in particular markets may adversely affect our financial performance 

global financial markets can experience volatility disruption and credit contraction which could adversely affect global economic conditions turmoil in the financial equity and credit markets or other changes in economic conditions could adversely affect sources of liquidity available to us or our costs of capital and could adversely affect plan asset values and investment performance and increase our pension liabilities expenses and funding requirements and other related financial exposure with respect to companysponsored and multiemployer pension plans our strategies for managing these financial risks and exposures may not be effective or sufficient or may expose us to risk economic conditions both on a global level and in particular markets including unemployment levels availability of disposable income and actual and perceived wealth health care costs costs of oil gas and other commodities interest and tax rates and policies weakness in the housing market volatility in capital markets credit availability inflation and deflation as well as political or other factors beyond our control such as threats or possibilities of war terrorism global or national unrest actual or threatened pandemics or epidemics such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic geopolitical instability or uncertainty and regulatory volatility or uncertainty including in areas such as international trade for example the uncertainty related to us trade policy and the implementation of tariff policies as well as ongoing discussions and uncertainty related to negotiations following the uks withdrawal in january 2020 from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” may also have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending that would in turn affect our business or the retail industry generally these conditions and factors could adversely affect discretionary consumer spending or shift trends in consumer spending and although we believe our flexible offprice model helps us react to such trends they may adversely affect our sales cash flows merchandise orders and results of operations and performance 

our business may be materially and adversely affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

in december 2019 covid19 emerged and has subsequently spread worldwide the world health organization has declared covid19 a pandemic resulting in federal state and local governments and private entities mandating various restrictions including travel restrictions restrictions on public gatherings stay at home orders and advisories and quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus after close monitoring and taking into consideration the guidance from federal state and local governments in an effort to mitigate the spread of covid19 effective march 19 2020 the company closed all of its stores for at least two weeks and has temporarily closed its online businesses its distribution centers and its offices with associates working remotely where possible the company continues to monitor developments including government requirements and recommendations at the national state and local level to evaluate possible extensions to all or part of such closures 

the temporary closure of our stores online businesses distribution centers and offices are expected to have an adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and liquidity for example although our daytoday operations have been disrupted we have incurred and may continue to incur labor costs during these closures in addition after some or all of our stores reopen any significant reduction in our customers’ willingness to shop our stores the levels of our customers’ spending at our stores or our associates’ willingness to staff our stores and distribution centers as a result of health concerns related to covid19 or its impact on the economy and consumer discretionary spending may impact our business operations financial performance and liquidity the extent of the impact of covid19 on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic and the response to contain it 

labor costs including wage pension and healthcare costs and other challenges from our large workforce may adversely affect our results and profitability 

we have a large workforce and our ability to meet our labor needs and control labor costs is subject to various factors such as minimum wage laws and benefits requirements market pressures including prevailing wage rates and benefit levels and unemployment levels changing demographics economic conditions interest rate changes actuarial assumptions and methods the costs of providing and managing retirement health and other employee benefits including health and insurance costs and a dynamic regulatory and policy environment including with respect to health care immigration labor employment pension and other employee benefits and taxes any of these factors could increase our labor costs 

increased labor costs may adversely affect our results of operations in addition when wage rates or benefit levels increase in a market increasing our wages or benefits has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our earnings conversely failing to offer competitive wages or benefits could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain sufficient or quality associates causing our customer service or performance to suffer which could negatively impact our results 

many associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore we are subject to the risk of labor actions of various kinds including work stoppage as well as risks and potential material expenses associated with multiemployer plans including from pension plan underfunding benefit cuts increased contribution or funding requirements changes in plan terms withdrawal liability increased premium costs or insolvency of other participating employers or governmental insurance programs other associates in europe are members of works councils which may subject us to additional requirements actions or expense costs related to these factors could adversely affect our business operations or financial results 

failure to employ quality associates in appropriate numbers and to retain key associates and management could adversely affect our performance 

our performance depends on recruiting hiring developing training and retaining talented associates in key areas such as buying and management we also need to employ capable engaged associates in large numbers for our stores and distribution centers and to a lesser extent for other areas of our business including information technology functions we must constantly recruit new associates to fill entry level and parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover and at times find seasonal talent in sufficient numbers the availability and skill of associates may differ across markets in which we do business and in new markets we enter and we may be unable to manage our labor needs effectively in addition because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must provide significant internal training and development for key associates across the company including within our buying organization similar to other retailers we face challenges in securing and retaining sufficient talent in management and other key areas for many reasons including competition for talent in the retail industry and in various geographic markets if we do not effectively attract qualified individuals train them in our business model support their development and retain them in sufficient numbers and at appropriate levels of the organization our growth could be limited and our performance could be adversely affected 

compromises of our data security disruptions in our information technology systems or failure to satisfy the information technology needs of our business could result in material loss or liability materially impact our operating results or materially harm our reputation 

our business depends on our information technology systems which collect and process information of customers associates and other persons as well as information of our business and of our suppliers and service providers we rely heavily on information technology systems including those of suppliers and service providers to manage all key aspects of our business including planning purchasing sales supply chain management inventory management pointofsale processing ecommerce human resources financial management communications safeguarding information and compliance with legal obligations this reliance requires us to accurately anticipate our current and future information technology needs and successfully develop implement and maintain appropriate systems our ongoing operations and successful growth are dependent on doing so as well as the ongoing integrity security and consistent operations of these systems including related backup systems 

as is common in the retail industry our information technology systems as well as those of our suppliers and service providers are targeted by attempts to access personal or sensitive information attempts to steal money and attempts to disrupt business these attempts could include use of malware ransomware phishing social engineering denialofservice attacks exploitation of system vulnerabilities employee malfeasance digital and physical skimmers account takeovers and other forms of cyber attacks these attempts are becoming increasingly sophisticated heightening the risk of compromise or disruption our and our suppliers’ and service providers’ information technology systems also may be damaged or disrupted or personal or sensitive information compromised from a number of other causes including power outages system failures catastrophic events or employee inadvertence such damage disruption or compromise could materially impair our ability to operate our business or otherwise result in material impacts on our operating results in addition the global regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding and unauthorized access of personal or sensitive information could result in regulatory enforcement actions class actions contract liability or other forms of material legal liability any successful compromise or disruption of our information technology systems could result in material reputational harm and impact our customers’ willingness to shop in our stores or online andor our suppliers’ willingness to do business with us 

we maintain policies procedures and controls designed to reduce the risk of data security compromises and information technology failures or disruptions while we have implemented measures designed to further strengthen these policies procedures and controls since the unauthorized intrusions into our network discovered late in 2006 we may suffer a similar event in the future these measures also require costly and ongoing investment in technologies hiring training and compliance 

there is a risk of material business disruption liability and reputational damage associated with ongoing actions intended to update enhance modify or replace our systems and infrastructure including from not accurately capturing and maintaining data efficiently testing and implementing changes realizing the expected benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption of the actions and diversion of internal teams’ attention as the changes are implemented 

damage to our corporate reputation or those of our retail banners could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

we believe that building the brand reputation of our company and our retail banners is important to our continuing success in the many different markets in which we do business we work to build relationships with our customers through our various marketing campaigns and other activities these relationships and our reputation are based in part on perceptions of subjective qualities incidents involving us our retail banners our executives or other associates our policies and practices our third party providers our vendors the merchandise and brands including our licensed or owned brands that we carry or our industry more generally that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business particularly if the incidents result in rapid or significant adverse publicity litigation or governmental inquiry information about us our retail banners our executives and other associates our board of directors our policies and practices our third party providers our vendors and the merchandise and brands we sell including our licensed or owned brands that is publicized through traditional or digital media platforms including blogs websites and other forums that facilitate rapid broad communications to an audience of consumers and other interested persons may adversely affect our reputation and brand even if the information is inaccurate incomplete or unverified the reputation of our company and our retail banners may be damaged in a market or markets in which we do business by adverse events at the corporate level or at our retail banners or by adverse events involving our directors executives or other associates similarly challenges or reactions to action or inaction or perceived action or inaction by our company on issues like corporate social responsibility our response to crises including the covid19 pandemic responsible sourcing environmental sustainability human rights politics and lobbying privacy merchandising product safety compensation and benefits labor compliance or other sensitive topics and any perceived lack of transparency about such matters could harm our reputation particularly as expectations of companies and of companies’ corporate responsibility obligations may continue to change damage to the reputation of our company and our banners could result in declines in customer loyalty and sales affect our vendor relationships business development opportunities and our ability to attract and retain quality associates divert attention and resources from management including to respond to inquiries or additional regulatory scrutiny and otherwise adversely affect our results 

quality safety or other issues with merchandise we buy and sell could damage our reputation sales and financial results 

various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we import transport and sell to consumers regulations and standards in this area including federal regulations related to the us consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 and the us food safety modernization act state regulations like california’s proposition 65 and similar legislation in other countries in which we operate impose restrictions and requirements on the merchandise we buy and sell these regulations change from time to time and new federal state provincial or local regulations in the us and other countries that may affect our business are contemplated and enacted with some regularity if we or our merchandise vendors are unable to comply with regulatory requirements on a timely basis or at all or to adequately monitor new regulations that may apply to existing or new merchandise categories or in new geographies we could incur significant fines or penalties or we could have to curtail some aspects of our sales or operations which could have an adverse effect on our financial results we rely on our vendors to provide quality merchandise that complies with applicable product safety laws labeling requirements and other applicable laws but they may not comply with their obligations to do so although our arrangements with our vendors frequently provide for indemnification for product liabilities the vendors may fail to honor those obligations to an extent we consider sufficient or at all in certain circumstances we may bear some responsibility for compliance with applicable product safety laws labeling requirements and other applicable laws concerns or issues with the quality and safety of merchandise raised publicly particularly with products subject to increased levels of regulation or the genuineness of merchandise regardless of whether verified or our fault could cause damage to our reputation and could result in lost sales uninsured claims or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs and regulatory civil or criminal fines or penalties any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

failure to comply with laws rules regulations and orders and applicable accounting principles and interpretations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

we are subject to federal state provincial regional and local laws rules and regulations as well as government orders in various countries in which we operate these legal regulatory and administrative requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business including the cost of providing health care and retirement benefits workforce management logistics marketing importexport sourcing and manufacturing tax data protection and others if we or third parties that perform services on our behalf fail to comply with applicable laws rules regulations and orders we may be subject to judgments fines or other costs or penalties which could adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition 

complying with applicable laws rules regulations orders and our own internal policies may also require us to spend additional time and resources to implement new procedures and financial and other controls conduct audits train associates and third parties on our compliance methods or take other actions particularly as we continue to grow globally and enter new markets countries or product categories any of which could adversely impact our results 

we are also subject to and must comply with new and changing laws rules and regulations evolving interpretations of existing laws by judicial and regulatory authorities and reforms in jurisdictions where we do business these changes could increase our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our operating results including such changes involving 

– labor and employment practices and benefits including for labor unions and works councils 

– climate change energy and waste 

– supply chain trade restrictions and logistics including resulting from changes to requirements or policies from the outcome of brexit 

– health and welfare regulations 

– consumer protection and product safety 

– financial regulations 

– data protection and privacy such as to comply with or fines and penalties related to the general data protection regulation in the european union and the california consumer privacy act 

– internet regulations including ecommerce electronic communications and privacy and 

– protection of intellectual property rights 

  

particularly in a dynamic regulatory environment anticipated changes to laws and regulations may require us to invest in compliance efforts or otherwise expend resources before changes are certain for example the ongoing uncertainty around brexit including relating to the range of possible outcomes as the uk negotiates its postbrexit relationship with the european union has required us to consider and in some cases implement strategies for mitigating potential disruptions to our supply chain 

further applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time and the changes could have material effects on our future or previously reported financial results 

our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic events or public health crises as well as adverse or unseasonable weather 

natural or other disasters such as hurricanes  tornadoes floods earthquakes and other extreme weather climate conditions unforeseen public health issues such as pandemics and epidemics including the ongoing covid19 pandemic or fires explosions and acts of war or terrorism could disrupt our operations in a number of ways including severely damaging or destroying one or more of our stores distribution facilities data centers or office facilities or could disrupt the operations of or require the closure of one or more of our vendors or other parts of our supply chain located in the affected areas daytoday operations including our ability to receive products from our vendors or third party service providers or transport products to our stores or to our ecommerce customers could be adversely affected transportation to and from our stores by customers or associates could be limited or we could close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by affected distribution centers for a short or extended period of time as with closures of our stores and other facilities beginning in march 2020 and as we did in areas of the us including puerto rico after severe hurricanes during fiscal 2018 

adverse weather can similarly affect our operations in impacted areas adverse or unseasonable weather such as storms severe cold or heat or unseasonable temperatures even if not extreme may also affect customers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop certain categories we offer or at all and accordingly can adversely affect the demand for the merchandise in our stores particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise possibly impacting our sales and customer satisfaction with our stores and increasing markdowns as a result our business could be adversely affected 

our expanding international operations expose us to risks inherent in operating in new countries 

we have a significant retail presence in canada australia and countries in europe we also operate buying offices around the world our goal is to continue to expand our operations into other countries in the future it can be costly and complex to establish develop and maintain international operations and promote business in new international jurisdictions which may differ significantly from other countries in which we currently operate 

just as with our current operations there are risks inherent in opening and developing operations in new countries such those related to compliance under the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act additional risks include among others understanding the local retail climate and trends local customs and cultures seasonal differences business practices and competitive conditions complying with relevant laws rules and regulations developing the appropriate infrastructure identifying suitable partners for local operations and for integration with our global operations and effectively communicating and implementing company policies and practices in new possibly remote jurisdictions there are also financial regulatory and other risks associated with international operations including currency exchange fluctuations potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds outside of the country where earned trade regulations the risk of sudden policy or regulatory changes the risk of political economic and civil instability and labor unrest and uncertainties regarding interpretation application and enforceability of laws and agreements any of these risks could adversely impact our operations profitability or liquidity 

we are subject to risks associated with sourcing merchandise from others particularly where sourcing from other countries and moving merchandise internationally 

we are subject to various risks of sourcing merchandise from others particularly other countries including risks related to moving merchandise internationally many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a lesser extent by us in locations particularly southeastern asia which are outside of the country where they will be sold where we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements including those similar to requirements imposed upon the manufacturer of such products risks related to sourcing merchandise include 

– potential disruptions in manufacturing and supply 

– changes in duties tariffs trade restrictions sanctions quotas and voluntary export restrictions on imported merchandise including for example tariffs and border adjustment taxes changes to the united states mexico canada agreement the successor to the north american free trade agreement or successor or other trade agreements or changes to trade requirements resulting from brexit 

– transport availability capacity and costs 

– information technology challenges 

– problems in thirdparty distribution and warehousing logistics transportation and other supply chain interruptions 

– strikes threats of strikes and other events affecting delivery 

– consumer perceptions of the safety or quality of imported merchandise 

– compliance with product laws and regulations of the destination country 

– compliance with laws and regulations including changing labor environmental international trade and other laws in relevant countries and those concerning ethical business practices such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 

– product liability claims from customers or penalties from government agencies relating to products that are recalled defective or otherwise noncompliant or alleged to be harmful 

– intellectual property enforcement and infringement issues 

– pandemics and epidemics including the ongoing covid19 pandemic affecting sourcing including manufacturing buying or delivery 

– concerns about human rights working conditions and other labor rights and conditions in countries where merchandise is produced 

– concerns about transparent sourcing and supply chains 

– currency exchange rates and financial or economic instability and 

– political or other disruptions in countries from to or through which merchandise is imported 

these and other factors relating to sourcing international trade and imported merchandise could affect the availability and the price of our inventory and our operating costs furthermore although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to production of merchandise international operations and importing merchandise there can be no assurance that our associates and our contractors agents vendors or other third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our reputation operations or operating results 

our results may be adversely affected by reduced availability of or increases in the price of oil or other fuels increased costs of other commodities or other increases in utility transportation or logistics costs 

energy and fuel costs can fluctuate dramatically and at times have resulted in significant cost increases particularly for the price of oil and gasoline an increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers although we typically enter into derivative instruments designed to manage a portion of our transportation costs a hedging strategy any such strategy may not be effective or sufficient and could result in increased operating costs increased regulation related to environmental costs including cap and trade carbon taxes or other emissions management systems could also adversely affect our costs of doing business including utility transportation and logistics costs as could other shortages or disruptions impacting transportation such as those relating to trucking and freight hauling for example in recent years increased freight cost related to labor and equipment shortages as well as other factors had an impact on our margins similarly other commodity prices can fluctuate dramatically such increases can impact the cost of merchandise which could adversely affect our performance through potentially reduced consumer demand or reduced margins 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and changes in currency exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into us dollars for financial reporting purposes because of this movements in currency exchange rates have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our consolidated and segment results from time to time changes in currency exchange rates can also increase the cost of inventory purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the business buying the merchandise when exchange rates change significantly in a short period or move unfavorably over an extended period it can be difficult for us to adjust retail prices accordingly and gross margin can be adversely affected for example a significant amount of merchandise we offer for sale is made in china and accordingly a revaluation of chinese currency or increased market flexibility in the exchange rate for that currency increasing its value relative to the us dollar or currencies in which our stores are located could be significant 

additionally we routinely enter into inventoryrelated derivative instruments a hedging strategy to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rates on merchandise margins of merchandise purchases by our segments denominated in currencies other than their local currencies in accordance with gaap we evaluate the fair value of these derivative instruments and make marktomarket adjustments at the end of each accounting period these adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our earnings 

although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates we expect that currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations from time to time in addition fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our earnings and operating results if a counterparty to one of our hedging arrangements fails to perform 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate and may fall short of prior periods our projections or the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past and they may do so in the future if we fail to increase our results over prior periods to achieve our projected results or to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price may decline and the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance results may be affected by various factors including those described in these risk factors we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to plan sales and align expenses if we do not control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results or if actual results differ significantly from our forecast our financial performance could be adversely affected in addition if we do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplated pursuant to our stock repurchase programs our earnings per share may be adversely affected 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions or investments in new businesses or divest close or consolidate any of our current businesses our business will be subject to additional risks 

we may acquire new businesses as we did with our australia business in fiscal 2016 and sierra in fiscal 2013 invest in other businesses as we did with our minority investment interest in privately held familia a russian offprice apparel and home fashions retailer in fiscal 2020 or enter into joint ventures with other businesses develop new businesses internally as with homesense our us home store concept launched in fiscal 2018 and divest close or consolidate businesses failure to execute on mergers acquisitions investments divestitures closings and consolidations in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition acquisition investment or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses and we may not effectively evaluate target companies investments or investment partners or assess the risks benefits and costs of buying investing in or closing businesses or of the integration of acquired businesses all of which can be difficult timeconsuming and dilutive these activities may not meet our performance and other expectations and may expose us to unexpected or greaterthanexpected costs liabilities and risks in addition we recorded intangible assets and goodwill and the value of the tradenames in connection with our last acquisitions and may similarly do so in the future in connection with other acquisitions if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions we may be required to impair some or all of the goodwill associated with an acquisition which would adversely impact our results of operations and balance sheet such as with the impairment charge related to sierra taken during fiscal 2018 divestitures closings and consolidations could involve risks such as significant costs and obligations of closure including exposure on leases owned real estate and other contractual employment pension and severance obligations and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer 

our results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation legal proceedings and other legal or regulatory matters 

we are involved or may in the future become involved in legal proceedings regulatory reviews audits and other legal matters these may involve inquiries investigations lawsuits and other proceedings by local provincial state and federal governmental entities in the united states and other countries and private plaintiffs including with respect to employment and employee benefits such as classification employment rights discrimination wage and hour and retaliation whistleblower claims harassment claims tax securities disclosure real estate environmental matters hazardous materials and hazardous waste tort business practices consumer protection privacydata security product safety and compliance advertising and intellectual property there continue to be employmentrelated and consumer protection lawsuits including putative class actions in the united states and we are subject to these types of suits we cannot predict the results of legal and regulatory proceedings with certainty and actual results may differ from any reserves we establish estimating the probable outcome regardless of merit or outcome these proceedings can be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expense and diversion of management attention legal regulatory and other proceedings could expose us to significant defense costs fines penalties and liability to private parties and governmental entities for monetary recoveries and other amounts and attorneys’ fees andor require us to change aspects of our operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

as our business is subject to seasonal influences a decrease in sales or margins a severe disruption or other significant event that impacts our business during the second half of the year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operating results 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we generally realize higher levels of sales and earnings in the second half of the year which includes the backtoschool and yearend holiday seasons any decrease in sales or margins or any significant adverse event during this period including those described in this section could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our operations growth stock repurchases and dividends and interest and debt repayment 

our business depends upon our operations to continue to generate strong cash flow to supply capital to support our general operating activities to fund our growth and our return of cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase programs and dividends and to pay our interest and debt repayments for example as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic we temporarily closed our stores beginning in march 2020 we also suspended our share repurchase program in addition the company does not intend to declare a dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and we continue to evaluate our dividend program in the near term our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or to repatriate cash from our international operations in a manner that is cost effective could adversely affect our growth plans capital expenditures operating expenses and financial performance including our earnings per share changes in the capital and credit markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of liquidity our continued access to these liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors including our operating performance and maintaining strong credit ratings we borrow on occasion to finance our activities and if financing were not available to us in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed it could also adversely affect our financial performance 

failure to protect our inventory or other assets from loss and theft may impact our financial results 

risk of loss or theft of assets including inventory shrinkage is inherent in the retail business loss may be caused by error or misconduct of associates customers vendors or third parties our inability to effectively combat andor minimize the loss or theft of assets or to effectively reduce the impact of those losses could adversely affect our financial performance 

tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including the results of tax audits and examinations income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory income tax rates changes in income tax rates changes in transfer pricing changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in applicable tax legislation regulations treaties and other guidance and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “2017 tax act” significantly revised the previous federal income tax code additional interpretive guidance has been and will continue to be issued with respect to the 2017 tax act and such guidance may be different from our interpretation and thus adversely affect our results in addition it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the 2017 tax act which could also impact our tax obligations significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision and accruals for taxes and actual results may differ from our estimations 

in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state provincial and local tax authorities in the us and foreign countries and the examining authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various proceedings which are at various stages with such authorities with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these proceedings to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of our provision for income taxes and increase and decrease our provision as a result of these assessments however developments in and actual results of proceedings rulings or settlements by or with tax authorities or courts including due to changes in facts law or legal interpretations expiration of applicable statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions could result in amounts that differ from those we have accrued for such proceedings in either a positive or a negative manner which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations in addition we are subject to tax audits and examinations for payroll value added salesbased and other taxes relating to our businesses 

our real estate leases generally obligate us for long periods which subjects us to financial risks 

we lease virtually all of our store locations and either own or lease for long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices accordingly we are subject to the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate which can adversely affect our results while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions including by making specified payments we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so if we decide or are required to close stores we are generally required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases which generally include among other things paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or paying to exercise rights to terminate and the performance of any of these obligations may be expensive when we assign leases or sublease space to third parties or if we sell a business we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform as was the case with some of our former operations in addition when the lease terms for the stores in our ongoing operations expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to close stores or to relocate stores within a market on less favorable terms or in a less favorable location

investment in familia 

on november 18 2019 the company through a wholly owned subsidiary completed an investment of 225 million excluding acquisition costs for a 25 ownership stake in privately held familia an established offprice apparel and home fashions retailer with more than 275 stores throughout russia the companys investment represents a noncontrolling minority position as part of this investment tjx has the right to appoint and has appointed one member to the board of directors of familia 

this investment is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting from the date of investment forward tjx will report its share of familia’s results on a onequarter lag as their results are not expected to be available in time to be recorded in the concurrent period as a result there were no reported earnings from tjxs investment in familia for the fiscal year ended february 1 2020 

recent events and trends 

covid19 

in december 2019 a novel coronavirus “covid19” emerged and has subsequently spread worldwide the world health organization has declared covid19 a pandemic resulting in federal state and local governments and private entities mandating various restrictions including travel restrictions restrictions on public gatherings stay at home orders and advisories and quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus after close monitoring and taking into consideration the guidance from federal state and local governments in an effort to mitigate the spread of covid19 effective march 19 2020 the company closed all of its stores for at least two weeks and has temporarily closed its online businesses its distribution centers and its offices with associates working remotely where possible the company continues to monitor developments including government requirements and recommendations at the federal state and local level to evaluate possible extensions to all or part of such closures we expect the cadence of store reopenings to vary by state and locality in the us and by country tjx has committed to pay its associates until the week ending april 4 2020 during these closures the temporary closure of our stores is expected to have an adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and liquidity 

in addition we have taken several steps to further strengthen our financial position and balance sheet and maintain financial liquidity and flexibility including suspending our share repurchase program reviewing operating expenses evaluating merchandise purchases reducing capital expenditures and drawing down 10 billion on our revolving credit facilities in addition we do not intend to declare a dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we continue to evaluate our dividend program in the near term while we remain committed to paying our dividends whenever the environment normalizes for the long term we also withdrew our first quarter and full year fiscal 2021 financial guidance given on our february 26 2020 earnings conference call the company is not providing an updated outlook at this time 

as the covid19 pandemic is complex and rapidly evolving the companys plans as described above may change at this point we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

impact of brexit 

on january 31 2020 the united kingdom “uk” left the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” and entered an 11month transition period the “transition period” during which the uk continues to be treated as an eu member for most purposes this transition period is due to end on december 31 2020 and the uk and eu are currently negotiating the terms of their future relationship that will apply after this date 

the terms of the future euuk trading relationship remain uncertain our tjx europe management team has evaluated a range of possible outcomes identified areas of concern and implemented strategies to help mitigate them 

we expect the future euuk trading relationship will subject the movement of goods between the uk and the eu to additional regulatory and compliance requirements which is likely to have a negative impact on our ability to efficiently move merchandise in the region we have realigned our european division’s supply chain to reduce the volume of merchandise flowing between the uk and the eu and have established resources and systems to support this plan 

there are also likely to be additional customs duty costs on euuk trade the extent of which remain uncertain any customs duties may also impact the profitability of our european division at least in the short term 

new immigration requirements between the uk and eu countries may also have a negative impact on our ability to recruit and retain current and future talent in the region we continue to communicate with our associates about the new immigration requirements 

in addition to these operational impacts factors including changes in consumer confidence and behavior economic conditions interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could result in a significant financial impact to our european operations particularly in the short term we believe the steps we have taken and plan to take will help us mitigate the effects when the transition period ends  

tariffs 

the us administration has imposed tariffs on imports from china we continue to monitor the developments very closely and have started to see margin pressure based on the tariffs currently in place on the goods sourced directly from china the impact on vendor and competitor pricing consumer demand potential tariff passthroughs and the fluctuation of the chinese currency remains uncertain 

net sales 

net sales for fiscal 2020 totaled 417 billion a 7 increase over fiscal 2019 the increase reflected a 4 increase from comp stores and a 4 increase from noncomp sales foreign currency had a 1 negative impact in fiscal 2020 net sales from our ecommerce businesses combined amounted to approximately 2 of total sales and had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2020 sales growth 

consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019 totaled 390 billion a 9 increase over fiscal 2018 the increase reflected a 6 increase from comp stores and a 3 increase from noncomp sales foreign currency had a neutral impact in fiscal 2019 net sales from our ecommerce businesses combined amounted to approximately 2 of total sales and had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2019 sales growth 

revenues by geography 

the percentages of our consolidated revenues by geography for the last two fiscal years are as follows 



comparable store sales 

we define comparable store sales “comp sales” to be sales of stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation we calculate comp sales on a 52week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp percentage is immaterial 

we define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the comp sales calculation and average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold we define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the comp sales calculation 

sales excluded from comp sales “noncomp sales” consists of 

– new stores  stores that have not yet met the comp sales criteria which represents a substantial majority of noncomp sales 

– stores that are closed permanently or for an extended period of time 

– sales from our ecommerce sites meaning sierracom tjmaxxcom marshallscom and tkmaxxcom 

we determine which stores are included in the comp sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year for fiscal 2020 results sierra stores that otherwise fit the comp store definition are included in comp stores in our marmaxx segment 

comp sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year’s comp sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance 

comp sales may be referred to as “same store” sales by other retail companies the method for calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry therefore our measure of comp sales may not be comparable to other retail companies 

comp sales increases across all of our segments for fiscal 2020 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2020 home fashions and apparel both grew with apparel outperforming home fashions geographically in the us all regions reported solid comp sales increases with the southwest and southeast regions reporting the highest comp sales increases in canada comp sales were below the consolidated average and tjx international was well above the consolidated average 

comp sales increases across all of our segments for fiscal 2019 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2019 home fashions and apparel both grew with apparel outperforming home fashions geographically in the us the southeast great lakes and the southwest regions reported the highest comp sales increases and the mid atlantic was below the consolidated average comp sales increases for tjx canada and tjx international were below the consolidated average 

the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales 



 figures may not foot due to rounding 

impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the us dollar or a division’s local currency in relation to other currencies we specifically refer to “foreign currency” as the impact of translational foreign exchange and marktomarket of inventory derivatives as described in detail below this does not include the impact foreign currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division’s local currency referred to as “transactional foreign exchange” also described below 

translational foreign exchange 

in our financial statements we translate the operations of tjx canada and tjx international from local currencies into us dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of these segments currency translation generally does not affect operating margins or affects them only slightly as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at approximately the same rates within a given period 

marktomarket inventory derivatives 

we routinely enter into inventoryrelated hedging instruments to mitigate the impact on earnings of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise purchases denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of our divisions principally tjx canada and tjx international as we have not elected “hedge accounting” for these instruments as defined by us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” we record a marktomarket gain or loss on the derivative instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period in subsequent periods the income statement impact of the marktomarket adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is received and paid for while these effects occur every reporting period they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time the marktomarket adjustment on these derivatives does not affect net sales but it does affect the cost of sales operating margins and earnings we report 

transactional foreign exchange 

when discussing the impact on our results of the effect of foreign currency exchange rates on certain transactions we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange” this primarily includes the impact that foreign currency exchange rates may have on the yearoveryear comparison of merchandise margin as well as “foreign currency gains and losses” on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than the operating divisions local currency these two items can impact segment margin comparison of our foreign divisions and we have highlighted them when they are meaningful to understanding operating trends 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 715 in fiscal 2020 compared to 714 in fiscal 2019 the increase in this expense ratio during fiscal 2020 was driven by higher supply chain costs partially offset by the expense leverage on the strong comp sales growth 

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga expenses as a percentage of net sales were 179 in fiscal 2020 compared to 178 in fiscal 2019 the increase in this expense ratio reflects wage increases and incremental systems and technology costs partially offset by the expense leverage on the strong comp sales growth primarily advertising costs 

pension settlement charge 

during fiscal 2019 we annuitized and transferred current pension obligations for certain us retirees and beneficiaries under the qualified pension plan through the purchase of a group annuity contract with an insurance company we transferred 2074 million of pension plan assets to the insurance company thereby reducing our pension benefit obligations the transaction had no cash impact to tjx but did result in a noncash pretax pension settlement charge of 361 million 

interest expense net 

the components of interest expense net for the last two fiscal years are summarized below 



the increase in interest expense net for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by a decrease in interest income due to lower rates and lower capitalized interest on capital projects partially offset by the elimination of buildtosuit accounting as a result of adopting the new lease accounting standard for additional information see note a—basis of presentation and summary of accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 

provision for income taxes 

our effective annual income tax rate was 257 in fiscal 2020 compared to 267 in fiscal 2019 the decrease in the fiscal 2020 effective income tax rate is primarily driven by fiscal 2019 including a charge related to the 2017 tax act that was not incurred in fiscal 2020 and change in the jurisdictional mix of income 

net income and diluted earnings per share 

net income was 33 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to 31 billion in fiscal 2019 diluted earnings per share were 267 in fiscal 2020 and 243 in fiscal 2019 the pension settlement charge had a 002 negative impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2019 foreign currency exchange rates had a 001 negative impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 

our stock repurchase programs which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding benefited our earnings per share growth by approximately 3 in each fiscal year presented 

segment information 

we operate four main business segments our marmaxx segment tj maxx marshalls tjmaxxcom and marshallscom and the homegoods segment homegoods and homesense both operate in the united states our tjx canada segment operates winners homesense and marshalls in canada and our tjx international segment operates tk maxx homesense and tkmaxxcom in europe and tk maxx in australia in addition to our four main segments sierra operates sierracom and retail stores in the us the results of sierra are included in the marmaxx segment 

we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income or loss before general corporate expense interest expense net and certain separately disclosed unusual or infrequent items “segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities the terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales these measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity

general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments general corporate expenses are primarily included in sga expenses the marktomarket adjustment of our fuel hedges is included in cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs 

the increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by incremental systems and technology costs and stock compensation costs offset by the favorable yearoveryear comparison from the corporate it restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 2019 

analysis of financial condition 

liquidity and capital resources 

our liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations supplemented as needed by shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper as of february 1 2020 there were no shortterm bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding 

as part of the actions we have taken relating to the covid19 pandemic as described above in recent events and trends  on march 20 2020 we drew down 1 billion on our revolving credit facilities we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents internally generated funds and our credit facilities described in note j—longterm debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements are adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year subject to the length and severity of the covid19 pandemic 

as of february 1 2020 tjx held 32 billion in cash approximately 10 billion of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with 5847 million held in countries where we intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings tjx has provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in canada puerto rico italy india hong kong and vietnam through february 1 2020 if we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 41 billion in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2020 were essentially flat to fiscal 2019 net income adjusted for noncash items increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 by 03 billion this was primarily offset by a decrease in cash flows attributable to a reduction in income taxes payable 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2019 increased by 11 billion compared to fiscal 2018 net income adjusted for noncash items increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 by 05 billion in addition there was a 06 billion increase in cash flows related to prepaid expenses and other current assets largely due to the prefunding of certain service contracts in fiscal 2018 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 15 billion in fiscal 2020 and 06 billion in fiscal 2019 the cash outflows were primarily driven by capital expenditures and in fiscal 2020 the company invested 02 billion in familia an established offprice apparel and home fashion retail chain in russia in addition the activity in fiscal 2019 reflects the liquidation of shortterm investments by tjx canada as a result of a repatriation of earnings during the year 

net cash used in investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two fiscal years as set forth in the table below 



as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the length and severity of the covid19 pandemic we are reducing our expected capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 

on november 18 2019 the company through a wholly owned subsidiary completed an investment of 225 million excluding acquisition costs for a 25 ownership stake in privately held familia an established offprice apparel and home fashions retailer with more than 275 stores throughout russia the companys investment represents a noncontrolling minority position as part of this investment tjx has the right to appoint and has appointed one member to the board of directors of familia 

in fiscal 2019 we purchased 02 billion of investments and these cash outflows were more than offset by 06 billion of inflows related to investments that were sold or matured during fiscal 2019 this activity primarily related to shortterm investments which had initial maturities in excess of 90 days and are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 24 billion in fiscal 2020 and 31 billion in fiscal 2019 these cash outflows were primarily driven by equity repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by issuances of common stock 

equity 

tjx repurchased and retired 271 million shares of its common stock at a cost of 15 billion during fiscal 2020 on a “trade date basis” tjx reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis under our stock repurchase programs we spent 16 billion to repurchase 282 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2020 and 24 billion to repurchase 508 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2019 

for further information regarding equity repurchases see note d—capital stock and earnings per share of notes to consolidated financial statements 

in february 2020 tjx announced that its board of directors had approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to an additional 15 billion of tjx common stock from time to time in connection with the actions taken related to the covid19 pandemic as described in recent events and trends  the company suspended its share repurchase program 

dividends 

we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 092 per share in fiscal 2020 and 078 per share in fiscal 2019 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 11 billion in fiscal 2020 and 09 billion in fiscal 2019 we also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 02 billion in fiscal 2020 and 03 billion in fiscal 2019 

the company does not intend to declare a dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic the company is evaluating its dividend program in the near term while it remains committed to paying dividends whenever the environment normalizes for the long term 

contractual obligations 

as of february 1 2020 we had known contractual obligations under longterm debt arrangements including current installments other longterm obligations operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows 



a includes estimated interest costs 

b operating lease liabilities exclude legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced and include options to extend lease terms that are now deemed reasonably certain of being exercised according to our lease accounting policy the balances do not include variable costs for insurance real estate taxes other operating expenses and in some cases rentals based on a percentage of sales these items totaled approximately onethird of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2020 

c includes estimated obligations under purchase orders for merchandise and under agreements for capital items products and services used in our business including executive employment and other agreements excludes agreements that can be canceled without penalty 

we also have longterm liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include 5148 million for employee compensation and benefits and 2554 million for uncertain tax positions 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to the areas described below 

inventory valuation 

we use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except tk maxx in australia the businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale ie inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced typically a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns however as a normal business practice we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end historically the variance between estimated shrinkage and actual shrinkage has not been material to our annual financial results we do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and tradenames 

we evaluate our goodwill tradenames and longlived assets inclusive of operating lease right of use assets for indicators of impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores as well as of our business units which involve a number of factors including historical trends recent performance and general economic assumptions if we determine that an impairment of longlived assets operating lease right of use assets or tradenames has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets if we determine that an impairment of goodwill has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit over the estimated fair value of the reporting unit but not in excess of the carrying amount of goodwill we determine the fair value of our business units using the discounted cash flow method which requires assumptions for the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” and revenue growth for the related business unit the fair value of our business units exceeds their carrying value by a significant amount 

lease accounting 

operating leases are included in “operating lease right of use assets” “current portion of operating lease liabilities” and “longterm operating lease liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets right of use “rou” assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease at the inception of the arrangement the company determines if an arrangement is a lease based on assessment of the terms and conditions of the contract operating lease rou assets and lease liabilities are recognized at possession date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term the majority of our leases are retail store locations and the possession date is typically 30 to 60 days prior to the opening of the store and generally occurs before the commencement of the lease term as specified in the lease our lessors do not provide an implicit rate nor is one readily available therefore we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at possession date in determining the present value of future lease payments the incremental borrowing rate is calculated based on the us consumer discretionary yield curve and adjusted for collateralization and foreign currency impact for tjx international and canada leases the operating lease rou asset also includes any acquisition costs offset by lease incentives our lease terms include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term within “cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs” 

reserves for uncertain tax positions 

like many large corporations our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation assessment examination litigation and settlement the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain in accordance with gaap we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the positions we have taken will not be sustained however in the next twelve months and in future periods the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay as the result of the final resolutions of examinations judicial or administrative proceedings changes in facts law or legal interpretations expiration of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of or changes in tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

the 2017 tax act significantly changes how corporations are taxed requiring complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions and significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation as we continue to interpret any additional guidance we may make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made 

loss contingencies 

certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our management with the assistance of our legal counsel assesses such contingent liabilities such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable 

recent accounting pronouncements 

for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements related to leases internal use software income taxes and comprehensive income see note a—basis of presentation and summary of accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k including the dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations financial position or cash flows we do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tjx is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business some potential market risks are discussed below 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the us dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations our currency risk primarily relates to our activity in the canadian dollar british pound and euro as more fully described in note e—financial instruments of notes to consolidated financial statements we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments primarily at our international operations and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international operations we enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries our foreign exchange risk management policy prohibits us from using derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use any leveraged derivative financial instruments we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency as of february 1 2020 and february 2 2019 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pretax income by approximately 82 million and 84 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 respectively 

equity price and other market risk 

the assets of our funded qualified pension plan a portion of which are equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets we invest the pension assets described further in note i—pension plans and other retirement benefits of notes to consolidated financial statements in a manner that attempts to manage our exposure to market uncertainties investments in general are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility risks a significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan resulting in increased required contributions to the plan or other planrelated liabilities our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes

 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks that follow are those that we think individually or in the aggregate could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements 

failure to execute our opportunistic buying strategy and inventory management could adversely affect our results 

opportunistic buying operating with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are key elements of our offprice business strategy but subject us to risks related to the pricing quantity mix nature and timing of inventory flowing to our stores our merchants are in the marketplace frequently as much of our merchandise is purchased for the current or immediately upcoming season and our focus on buying opportunistically places considerable discretion with them our business model expects our merchants to effectively react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market assess the desirability and value of merchandise and generally make determinations of how and what we source as well as when we source it if we do not obtain the right merchandise at the right times in the right quantities at the right prices and in the right mix our customer traffic as well as our sales and margins could be adversely affected 

we base our purchases of inventory in part on our sales forecasts if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand either of which could adversely affect our financial performance 

if we are unable to generally purchase inventory at prices sufficiently below prices paid by conventional retailers we may not be able to maintain a sufficient overall pricing differential to fullprice retailers including department specialty and major online retailers and our ability to attract customers or sustain our margins may be adversely affected we may not achieve this pricing differential at various times or in some reporting segments chains or geographies which could adversely affect our results 

to respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns we need to appropriately allocate and deliver merchandise to our stores maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store and be flexible in our allocation of floor space at our stores among product categories if we are not able to do so our ability to attract and retain customers and our results could be adversely affected 

failure to continue to expand our business and operations successfully or to manage our substantial size and scale effectively could adversely affect our financial results 

our growth strategy includes successfully expanding within our current markets and into new geographic regions product lines and channels and as appropriate adding new businesses whether by development investment or acquisition managing growth effectively can be difficult if any aspect of our expansion strategy does not achieve the success we expect in whole or in part we may fail to meet our financial performance expectations andor may be required to increase investments slow our planned growth or close stores or operations various circumstances could adversely affect our expansion plans for example if we are not able to find and lease appropriate real estate on attractive terms in the locations where we seek to open stores we may need to change our planned growth in those areas similarly new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores whether in current or new markets our financial performance in new markets may not be the same as in existing markets and adding stores or banners to existing markets may otherwise adversely affect our sales and profitability in those markets 

further our substantial size can make it challenging to manage our complex operations effectively and to maintain appropriate internal resources and third party providers to support our business effectively these challenges increase as we grow our business and may add pressure to management and to various functions across our business including administration systems including information technology systems merchandising store operations distribution logistics and compliance increasing our size and complexity may also put additional pressure on appropriately staffing and training associates in these areas andor managing appropriate third party providers that support these areas the large size and scale of our operations our multiple banners and locations across the us canada europe and australia and the autonomy afforded to the banners in some aspects of the business also increases the risk that our systems controls practices and policies may not be implemented effectively or consistently throughout our company and that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations these risks may increase as we continue to grow particularly if we expand into additional countries if business information is not shared effectively or if we are otherwise unable to manage our size or growth effectively our business may be adversely affected or we may need to reduce the rate of expansion or otherwise curtail growth which may adversely affect our business plans sales and results 

failure to identify consumer trends and preferences to meet customer demand in new or existing markets or channels could negatively impact our performance 

as our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand and expectations we work to identify consumer trends and preferences on an ongoing basis and to offer inventory and shopping experiences that meet those trends and preferences however we may not do so effectively and on a timely basis across our diverse merchandise categories and in each of the many markets in the us canada europe and australia in which we do business trends and preferences in markets may differ from what we anticipate although our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer preferences and trends for example by expanding and contracting merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes we may not successfully do so which could add difficulty in attracting new customers retaining existing customers and encouraging frequent customer visits and could adversely affect our results 

customers may also have expectations about how they shop in stores or through ecommerce or more generally engage with businesses across different channels for example through various digital platforms which expectations may vary across demographics and may evolve rapidly meeting these expectations effectively involves identifying the right opportunities and making the right investments at the right time and with the right speed among other things and failure to do so may impact our financial results 

if we fail to successfully implement our various marketing efforts or if our competitors’ programs are more effective than ours our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise may be influenced by our marketing efforts although we use marketing to drive customer traffic through various media including television radio print outdoor digitalsocial media email mobile and direct mail some of our competitors expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage further we may not effectively implement strategies with respect to rapidly evolving digital communication channels our programs may not be or remain effective or could require increased expenditures which could have a significant adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the retail apparel and home fashion businesses are highly competitive we compete with local regional national and international retailers that sell apparel home fashions and other merchandise that we sell including retailers that operate through stores ecommerce catalogues andor other media or channels some of our competitors are larger than we are or have more experience in selling certain product lines or through certain channels than we do new competitors frequently enter the market existing competitors enter or increase their presence in markets in which we operate and may expand their merchandise offerings add new sales channels or change their pricing strategies all of which affect the competitive landscape consumer spending online has increased and may continue to increase while our business is primarily in stores we compete on the basis of various factors affecting value meaning the combination of brand fashion price and quality as well as merchandise selection and freshness banner name recognition and appeal both instore and online service and shopping experience convenience and store location if we fail to compete effectively our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 

failure to employ quality associates in appropriate numbers and to retain key associates and management could adversely affect our performance 

our performance depends on recruiting hiring developing training and retaining talented associates in key areas such as buying and management we also need to hire capable engaged associates in large numbers for our stores and distribution centers and for other areas of our business including information technology functions we must constantly recruit new associates to fill entry level and parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover and at times find seasonal talent in sufficient numbers availability and skill of associates may differ across markets in which we do business and in new markets we enter and we may be unable to manage our labor needs effectively in addition because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must provide significant internal training and development for key associates across the company including within our buying organization similar to other retailers we face challenges in securing and retaining sufficient talent in management and other key areas for many reasons including competition for talent in the retail industry and in various geographic markets if we do not effectively attract qualified individuals train them in our business model support their development and retain them in sufficient numbers and at appropriate levels of the organization our growth could be limited and our performance could be adversely affected 

labor costs including wage pension and healthcare costs and other challenges from our large workforce may adversely affect our results and profitability 

we have a large workforce and our ability to meet our labor needs and control labor costs is subject to various factors such as minimum wage laws and benefits requirements market pressures including prevailing wage rates and benefit levels and unemployment levels changing demographics economic conditions interest rate changes actuarial assumptions and methods the costs of providing and managing retirement health and other employee benefits including health and insurance costs and a dynamic regulatory and policy environment including with respect to health care immigration labor employment pension and other employee benefits and taxes any of these factors could increase our labor costs 

increased labor costs may adversely affect our results of operations in addition when wage rates or benefit levels increase in a market increasing our wages or benefits may negatively impact our earnings as they did during the past several fiscal years conversely failing to offer competitive wages or benefits could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain sufficient or quality associates causing our customer service or performance to suffer which could impact our results 

many associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore we are subject to the risk of labor actions of various kinds as well as risks and potential material expenses associated with multiemployer plans including from pension plan underfunding benefit cuts increased contribution requirements changes in plan terms withdrawal liability increased premium costs or insolvency of other participating employers or governmental insurance programs other associates in europe are members of works councils which may subject us to additional requirements actions or expense 

compromises of our data security disruptions in our information technology systems or failure to satisfy the information technology needs of our business could result in material loss or liability materially impact our operating results or materially harm our reputation  

our business depends on our information technology systems which collect and process information of customers associates and other persons as well as information of our business and of our suppliers and service providers we rely heavily on information technology systems including those of suppliers and service providers to manage all key aspects of our business including planning purchasing sales supply chain management inventory management pointofsale processing ecommerce human resources financial management communications safeguarding information and compliance with legal obligations this reliance requires us to accurately anticipate our current and future information technology needs and successfully develop and implement appropriate systems that can provide the right support at the right time our ongoing operations and successful growth are dependent on the doing so as well as the ongoing integrity security and consistent operations of these systems including related backup systems 

as is common in the retail industry our information technology systems as well as those of our suppliers and service providers are targeted by attempts to access personal or sensitive information attempts to steal money and attempts to disrupt business these attempts could include use of malware ransomware phishing social engineering denialofservice attacks exploitation of software or product vulnerabilities employee malfeasance skimmers and shimmers and other forms of cyber attacks these attempts are becoming increasingly sophisticated heightening the risk of compromise or disruption our and our suppliers’ and service providers’ information technology systems also may be damaged or disrupted or personal or sensitive information compromised from a number of other causes including power outages system failures catastrophic events or employee inadvertence such damage or interruption could materially impair our ability to operate our business or otherwise result in material impacts on our operating results in addition the global regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding and unauthorized access of personal or sensitive information could result in regulatory enforcement actions class actions contract liability or other forms of material legal liability any successful compromise or disruption of our information technology systems could result in material reputational harm and impact our customers’ willingness to shop in our stores or online andor our suppliers’ willingness to do business with us 

we maintain policies procedures and controls designed to reduce the risk of data security compromises and information technology failures or disruptions while we have implemented measures designed to further strengthen these policies procedures and controls since the unauthorized intrusions into our network discovered late in 2006 we may suffer a similar event in the future these measures also require costly and ongoing investment in technologies hiring training and compliance 

there is a risk of material business disruption liability and reputational damage associated with ongoing actions intended to update enhance modify or replace our systems and infrastructure including from not accurately capturing and maintaining data efficiently testing and implementing changes realizing the expected benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption of the actions and diversion of internal teams’ attention as the changes are implemented 

economic conditions on a global level or in particular markets may adversely affect our financial performance 

global financial markets can experience volatility disruption and credit contraction which could adversely affect global economic conditions turmoil in the financial equity and credit markets or other changes in economic conditions could adversely affect sources of liquidity available to us or our costs of capital and could adversely affect plan asset values and investment performance and increase our pension liabilities expenses and funding requirements and other related financial exposure with respect to companysponsored and multiemployer pension plans our strategies for managing these financial risks and exposures may not be effective or sufficient economic conditions both on a global level and in particular markets including unemployment levels availability of disposable income and actual and perceived wealth energy and health care costs costs of oil gas and other commodities interest and tax rates and policies weakness in the housing market volatility in capital markets credit availability inflation and deflation as well as political or other factors beyond our control such as threats or possibilities of war terrorism global or national unrest actual or threatened epidemics geopolitical instability or uncertainty and regulatory volatility or uncertainty including in areas such as international trade for example the ongoing discussions and uncertainty related to brexit the uk’s decision to withdraw from the european union may also have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending that would in turn affect our business or the retail industry generally these conditions and factors could adversely affect discretionary consumer spending or shift trends in consumer spending and although we believe our flexible offprice model helps us react they may adversely affect our sales cash flows and results of operations and performance 

damage to our corporate reputation or those of our retail banners could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

we believe that building the brand reputation of our company and our retail banners is important to our continuing success in the many different markets in which we do business we work to build relationships with our customers through our various marketing campaigns and other activities these relationships and our reputation are based in part on perceptions of subjective qualities incidents involving us our retail banners our executives or other associates our policies and practices our third party providers our vendors the merchandise and brands including our licensed or owned brands that we carry or our industry more generally that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business particularly if the incidents result in rapid or significant adverse publicity litigation or governmental inquiry information about us our retail banners our executives and other associates our board of directors our policies and practices our third party providers our vendors and the merchandise and brands we sell including our licensed or owned brands that is publicized through traditional or digital media platforms including blogs websites and other forums that facilitate rapid broad communications to an audience of consumers and other interested persons may adversely affect our reputation and brand even if the information is inaccurate incomplete or unverified the reputation of our company and our retail banners may be damaged in a market or markets in which we do business by adverse events at the corporate level or at our retail banners or by a director or an executive or other associate acting outside of company policies and practices similarly challenges or reactions to action or inaction perceived action or inaction by our company on issues like social policies privacy merchandising compensation compliance related to social product labor and environmental standards or other sensitive topics and any perceived lack of transparency about such matters could harm our reputation particularly as expectations of companies and of companies’ corporate responsibility obligations may continue to change damage to the reputation of our company and our banners could result in declines in customer loyalty and sales affect our vendor relationships business development opportunities and our ability to attract and retain quality associates divert attention and resources from management including to respond to inquiries or additional regulatory scrutiny and otherwise adversely affect our results 

quality safety or other issues with merchandise we sell could damage our reputation sales and financial results 

various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we sell to consumers regulations and standards in this area including federal regulations related to the us consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 and the us food safety modernization act state regulations like california’s proposition 65 and similar legislation in other countries in which we operate impose restrictions and requirements on the merchandise we sell in our stores and through ecommerce these regulations change from time to time and new federal state provincial or local regulations in the us and other countries that may affect our business are contemplated and enacted with some regularity if we or our merchandise vendors are unable to comply with regulatory requirements on a timely basis or at all or to adequately monitor new regulations that may apply to existing or new merchandise categories or in new geographies we could incur significant fines or penalties or we could have to curtail some aspects of our sales or operations which could have an adverse effect on our financial results we rely on our vendors to provide quality merchandise that complies with applicable product safety laws labeling requirements and other applicable laws but they may not comply with their obligations to do so although our arrangements with our vendors frequently provide for indemnification for product liabilities the vendors may fail to honor those obligations to an extent we consider sufficient or at all concerns or issues with the quality and safety of merchandise raised publicly particularly with products subject to increased levels of regulation or the genuineness of merchandise regardless of whether verified or our fault could cause damage to our reputation and could result in lost sales uninsured claims or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs and regulatory civil or criminal fines or penalties any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

failure to comply with laws rules regulations and orders and applicable accounting principles and interpretations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

we are subject to federal state provincial regional and local laws rules and regulations as well as government orders in various countries in which we operate these legal regulatory and administrative requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business including the cost of providing health care and retirement benefits workforce management logistics marketing importexport sourcing and manufacturing tax data protection and others if we or third parties that perform services on our behalf fail to comply with applicable laws rules regulations and orders we may be subject to judgments fines or other costs or penalties which could adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition 

complying with applicable laws rules regulations orders and our own internal policies may also require us to spend additional time and resources to implement new procedures and financial and other controls conduct audits train associates and third parties on our compliance methods or take other actions particularly as we continue to grow globally and enter new markets or countries any of which could adversely impact our results 

we must also comply with new and changing laws rules and regulations evolving interpretations of existing laws by judicial and regulatory authorities and reforms in jurisdictions where we do business these changes could increase our costs of compliance or of doing business and could adversely affect our operating results including such changes involving 

   

particularly in a dynamic regulatory environment anticipated changes to laws and regulations may require us to invest in compliance efforts or otherwise expend resources before changes are certain for example the ongoing uncertainty around brexit including relating to timing and the range of possible outcomes has required us to consider and in some cases implement strategies for mitigating potential disruptions to our supply chain 

further applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time and the changes could have material effects on our future or previously reported financial results 

our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic events as well as adverse or unseasonable weather  

natural or other disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other extreme weather climate conditions unforeseen public health issues such as pandemics and epidemics or fires explosions and acts of war or terrorism could disrupt our operations in a number of ways including severely damaging or destroying one or more of our stores distribution facilities or data centers or could disrupt the operations of one or more of our vendors or other parts of our supply chain located in the affected areas daytoday operations including our ability to receive products from our vendors or third party service providers or transport products to our stores or to our ecommerce customers could be adversely affected transportation to and from our stores by customers or associates could be limited or we could be required to close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by affected distribution centers for a short or extended period of time as we did in areas of the us including puerto rico after severe hurricanes during fiscal 2018 

adverse weather can similarly affect our operations in impacted areas adverse or unseasonable weather such as storms severe cold or heat or unseasonable temperatures even if not extreme may also affect customers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop certain categories we offer or at all and accordingly can adversely affect the demand for the merchandise in our stores particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise possibly impacting our sales customer satisfaction with our stores and increasing markdowns as a result our business could be adversely affected 

our expanding international operations expose us to risks inherent in operating in new countries 

we have a significant retail presence in canada and in countries in europe and have expanded our retail operations into australia we also operate buying offices around the world our goal is to continue to expand our operations into other countries in the future it can be costly and complex to establish develop and maintain international operations and promote business in new international jurisdictions which may differ significantly from other countries in which we currently operate 

  

just as with our current operations there are risks inherent in opening and developing operations in new countries such those related to compliance under the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act additional risks include among others understanding the local retail climate and trends local customs and cultures seasonal differences business practices and competitive conditions complying with relevant laws rules and regulations developing the appropriate infrastructure identifying suitable partners for local operations and for integration with our global operations and effectively communicating and implementing company policies and practices in new possibly remote jurisdictions there are also financial regulatory and other risks associated with international operations including currency exchange fluctuations potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds outside of the country where earned trade regulations the risk of sudden policy or regulatory changes the risk of political economic and civil instability and labor unrest and uncertainties regarding interpretation application and enforceability of laws and agreements any of these risks could adversely impact our operations profitability or liquidity 

we are subject to risks associated with sourcing merchandise from others particularly where sourcing from other countries and moving merchandise internationally 

we are subject to various risks of sourcing merchandise from others particularly other countries including risks related to moving merchandise internationally many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a lesser extent by us in locations particularly southeastern asia which are outside of the country where they will be sold where we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements including those similar to requirements imposed upon the manufacturer of such products these risk include 



 

these and other factors relating to sourcing international trade and imported merchandise could affect the availability and the price of our inventory and our operating costs furthermore although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to production of merchandise international operations and importing merchandise there can be no assurance that our associates and our contractors agents vendors or other third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our reputation operations or operating results 

our results may be adversely affected by reduced availability of or increases in the price of oil or other fuels increased costs of other commodities or other increases in utility transportation or logistics costs 

energy and fuel costs can fluctuate dramatically and at times have resulted in significant cost increases particularly for the price of oil and gasoline an increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers although we typically enter into derivative instruments designed to manage a portion of our transportation costs a hedging strategy any such strategy may not be effective or sufficient and could result in increased operating costs increased regulation related to environmental costs including cap and trade carbon taxes or other emissions management systems could also adversely affect our costs of doing business including utility transportation and logistics costs as could other shortages or disruptions impacting transportation such as those relating to trucking and freight hauling for example in recent years increased freight cost related to labor and equipment shortages as well as other factors had an impact on our margins similarly other commodity prices can fluctuate dramatically such increases can increase the cost of merchandise which could adversely affect our performance through potentially reduced consumer demand or reduced margins 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and changes in currency exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into us dollars for financial reporting purposes because of this movements in currency exchange rates have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our consolidated and segment results from time to time changes in currency exchange rates can also increase the cost of inventory purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the business buying the merchandise when exchange rates change significantly in a short period or move unfavorably over an extended period as in recent years it can be difficult for us to adjust retail prices accordingly and gross margin can be adversely affected in addition a significant amount of merchandise we offer for sale is made in china and accordingly a revaluation of chinese currency or increased market flexibility in the exchange rate for that currency increasing its value relative to the us dollar or currencies in which our stores are located could be significant 

additionally we routinely enter into inventoryrelated derivative instruments a hedging strategy to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rates on merchandise margins of merchandise purchases by our segments denominated in currencies other than their local currencies in accordance with gaap we evaluate the fair value of these derivative instruments and make marktomarket adjustments at the end of each accounting period these adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our earnings 

although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates we expect that currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations from time to time in addition fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our earnings and operating results if a counterparty to one of our hedging arrangements fails to perform 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate and may fall short of prior periods our projections or the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past and they may do so in the future if we fail to increase our results over prior periods to achieve our projected results or to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price may decline and the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance results may be affected by various factors including those described in these risk factors we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to plan sales and align expenses if we do not control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results or if actual results differ significantly from our forecast our financial performance could be adversely affected in addition if we do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplated pursuant to our stock repurchase programs our earnings per share may be adversely affected 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions or investments in new businesses or divest close or consolidate any of our current businesses our business will be subject to additional risks 

we may acquire new businesses as we did with our australia business in fiscal 2016 and sierra in fiscal 2013 invest in or enter into joint ventures with other businesses develop new businesses internally as with homesense our us home store concept launched in fiscal 2018 and divest close or consolidate businesses failure to execute on mergers acquisitions investments divestitures closings and consolidations in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition acquisition investment or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses and we may not effectively evaluate target companies investments or investment partners or assess the risks benefits and costs of buying investing in or closing businesses or of the integration of acquired businesses all of which can be difficult timeconsuming and dilutive these activities may not meet our performance and other expectations and may expose us to unexpected or greaterthanexpected costs liabilities and risks in addition we recorded intangible assets and goodwill and the value of the tradenames in connection with our last acquisitions and may similarly do so in the future in connection with other acquisitions if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions we may be required to impair some or all of the goodwill associated with an acquisition which would adversely impact our results of operations and balance sheet such as with the impairment charge related to sierra taken during fiscal 2018 divestitures closings and consolidations could involve risks such as significant costs and obligations of closure including exposure on leases owned real estate and other contractual employment pension and severance obligations and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer 

our results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation legal proceedings and other legal or regulatory matters 

we are involved or may in the future become involved in legal proceedings regulatory reviews audits and other legal matters these may involve inquiries investigations lawsuits and other proceedings by local provincial state and federal governmental entities in the united states and other countries and private plaintiffs including with respect to employment and employee benefits such as classification employment rights discrimination wage and hour and retaliation whistle blower claims tax securities disclosure real estate environmental matters tort business practices consumer protection privacydata security product safety and compliance advertising and intellectual property there continue to be employmentrelated and consumer protection lawsuits including putative class actions in the united states and we are subject to these types of suits we cannot predict the results of legal and regulatory proceedings with certainty and actual results may differ from any reserves we establish estimating the probable outcome regardless of merit or outcome these proceedings can be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expense and diversion of management attention legal regulatory and other proceedings could expose us to significant defense costs fines penalties and liability to private parties and governmental entities for monetary recoveries and other amounts and attorneys’ fees andor require us to change aspects of our operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including the results of tax audits and examinations income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory income tax rates changes in income tax rates changes in transfer pricing changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in applicable tax legislation regulations treaties and other guidance and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods the us tax cut and jobs act of 2017 the “2017 tax act” significantly revised the previous federal income tax code it is expected that additional interpretive guidance will be issued with respect to the 2017 tax act and such guidance may be different from our interpretation and thus adversely affect our results in addition it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law which could also impact our tax obligations significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision and accruals for taxes and actual results may differ from our estimations 

in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state provincial and local tax authorities in the us and foreign countries and the examining authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various proceedings which are at various stages with such authorities with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these proceedings to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of our provision for income taxes and increase and decrease our provision as a result of these assessments however the developments in and actual results of proceedings or the result of rulings by or settlements with tax authorities and courts or due to changes in facts law or legal interpretations expiration of applicable statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions could differ from the amounts we have accrued for such proceedings in either a positive or a negative manner which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations in addition we are subject to tax audits and examinations for payroll value added salesbased and other taxes relating to our businesses 

as our business is subject to seasonal influences a decrease in sales or margins a severe disruption or other significant event that impacts our business during the second half of the year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operating results 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we generally realize higher levels of sales and earnings in the second half of the year which includes the backtoschool and yearend holiday seasons any decrease in sales or margins or any significant adverse event during this period including those described in the factors in this section could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations 

our real estate leases generally obligate us for long periods which subjects us to financial risks 

we lease virtually all of our store locations and either own or lease for long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices accordingly we are subject to the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate which can adversely affect our results while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions including by making specified payments we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so if we decide to close stores we are generally required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases which generally include among other things paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or paying to exercise rights to terminate and the performance of any of these obligations may be expensive when we assign leases or sublease space to third parties or if we sell a business we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform as was the case with some of our former operations in addition when the lease terms for the stores in our ongoing operations expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to close stores or to relocate stores within a market on less favorable terms or in a less favorable location 

failure to protect our inventory or other assets from loss and theft may impact our financial results 

risk of loss or theft of assets including inventory shrinkage is inherent in the retail business loss may be caused by error or misconduct of associates customers vendors or third parties our inability to effectively combat andor minimize the loss or theft of assets or to effectively reduce the impact of those losses could adversely affect our financial performance 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our operations growth stock repurchases and dividends and interest and debt repayment 

our business depends upon our operations to continue to generate strong cash flow to supply capital to support our general operating activities to fund our growth and our return of cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase programs and dividends and to pay our interest and debt repayments our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or to repatriate cash from our international operations in a manner that is cost effective could adversely affect our growth plans and financial performance including our earnings per share we borrow on occasion to finance our activities and if financing were not available to us in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed it could also adversely affect our financial performance

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 referred to as “tax reform” or the “2017 tax act” was enacted the 2017 tax act along with the related reinvestments made by the company had a significant impact on our fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 results see “ tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ”  below 

during fiscal 2019  we completed a twoforone stock split of our common stock as such all share and related data as well as basic and diluted earnings per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the split 

highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2019  include the following 

 

the following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results followed by a discussion of our segment operating results 

tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax act was enacted into law which included a reduction of the us corporate income tax rate to 21 percent effective january 1 2018 and had a significant impact on our fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 operating results the tax benefits recognized due to the 2017 tax act resulted in a net benefit to net income of 034 per share for fiscal 2019  in fiscal 2018 the company reinvested a portion of the tax benefits through a discretionary bonus to eligible nonbonus plan associates globally and an incremental contribution to the company’s defined contribution retirement plans for eligible associates in the us and internationally as well as making contributions to the company’s charitable foundations collectively referred to as “incremental investments related to the 2017 tax act” the tax benefits recognized due to the 2017 tax act offset by the aftertax impact of incremental investments we made related to the 2017 tax act resulted in a net benefit to net income of 009 per share for fiscal 2018 

impact of brexit 

the uk’s decision to leave the european union “eu” commonly referred to as “brexit” remains unsettled should the uk exit the eu there are several possible outcomes each of which creates risks for tjx especially in our european operations our tjx europe management team has evaluated a range of possible outcomes sought to identify areas of concern and implemented strategies to mitigate them our current european operations benefit from the free movement of goods and labor between the uk and eu as a result we believe brexit could have a negative impact on our ability to efficiently move merchandise between the uk and the eu brexit could also have a negative impact on our talent in the region both by impacting current associates who are either eu citizens working in the uk or uk citizens working in the eu and potentially impacting recruitment and retention for our european operations in the future 

if the uk does exit the eu this would require additional regulatory and compliance requirements for merchandise that flows between the uk and the eu we have developed a plan to realign our european division’s supply chain to reduce the volume of merchandise flowing between the uk and the eu and have established resources and systems to support this plan in addition we continue to communicate with our associates about brexit including by providing relevant information about additional procedures that may be required postbrexit 

we believe these steps will help us mitigate the operational risks that we expect could result from brexit if however brexit happens without a comprehensive withdrawal agreement between the uk and the eu and therefore without a longer transitional period our european operations could be significantly impacted particularly in the short term we believe that over time we would implement appropriate strategies to address that outcome 

net sales 

consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019  totaled 39 billion  a 9   increase  over 359 billion in fiscal 2018  the increase  reflected a 6 increase from comp stores and a 3 increase from noncomp sales foreign currency had a neutral impact in fiscal 2019  net sales from our ecommerce businesses combined amounted to approximately 2 of total sales and had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2019  sales growth 

consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018  totaled 359 billion an 8   increase  over 332 billion in fiscal 2017  the increase  reflected a 4 increase from noncomp sales a 2 increase from comp sales and a 2 increase from the impact of the 53 rd  week in the fiscal 2018  calendar foreign currency had a neutral impact in fiscal 2018  

revenues by geography 

the percentages of our consolidated revenues by geography for the last three fiscal years are as follows 



 comparable store sales 

we define comparable store sales “comp sales” to be sales of stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation we calculate comp sales on a 52week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp percentage is immaterial 

we define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the comp sales calculation and average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold we define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the comp sales calculation 

sales excluded from comp sales “noncomp sales” consists of 

 we determine which stores are included in the comp sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 37 stores were significantly impacted by hurricanes mostly in puerto rico and were excluded from comp sales these stores will be included in the comp sales measures once they again meet the comp sales criteria 

comp sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year’s comp sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance 

comp sales may be referred to as “same store” sales by other retail companies the method for calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry therefore our measure of comp sales may not be comparable to other retail companies 

comp sales increases across all of our segments for fiscal 2019  were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2019  home fashions and apparel both grew with apparel outperforming home fashions geographically in the us the southeast great lakes and the southwest regions reported the highest comp sales increases and the mid atlantic was below the consolidated average comp sales increases for tjx canada and tjx international were below the consolidated average 

comp sales increases across all of our segments for fiscal 2018  were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic we also had an increase in the number of units sold which was more than offset by a reduction in the average ticket in fiscal 2018  home fashions and apparel both grew with home fashions performing better than apparel geographically in the us the southeast and the southwest regions reported the highest comp sales increases and the northeast was below the consolidated average in canada comp sales increases were well above the consolidated average and tjx international was at the consolidated average 

the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales 



 impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the us dollar or a division’s local currency in relation to other currencies two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows 



 we refer to the impact of the above two items throughout our discussion as “foreign currency” this does not include the impact currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division’s local currency when discussing the impact on our results of the effect of currency exchange rates on such transactions we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange” 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 714  in fiscal 2019  compared to 711  in fiscal 2018  and 710  in fiscal 2017  the increase in this expense ratio during fiscal 2019  was driven by higher supply chain costs as we continue to invest in existing and open new distribution centers as well as the absence of the benefit of the 53rd week reflected in last years expense ratio merchandise margin was essentially flat compared to fiscal 2018  despite significantly higher freight costs 

the increase in the fiscal 2018  expense ratio was driven by higher supply chain costs as we continue to invest and open new distribution centers this was offset by the favorable impact of marktomarket of inventory derivatives that benefited the expense ratio by approximately 01 percentage point as well as an estimated 01 percentage point benefit from the 53rd week in the company’s fiscal 2018  calendar fiscal 2018  merchandise margin was essentially flat to fiscal 2017  

selling general and administrative expenses 

sga expenses as a percentage of net sales were 178  in fiscal 2019  and fiscal 2018  and 174  in fiscal 2017  the fiscal 2019  expense ratio reflects an increase in incentive compensation accruals due to a stronger than expected operating performance as well as store wage increases partially offset by leverage on strong comp sales the fiscal 2018  expense ratio reflects the impact of the incremental investments related to the 2017 tax act and higher employee payroll costs due to wage increases 

impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets related to sierra 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we recorded a 993  million impairment charge primarily related to goodwill as the estimated fair value of sierra fell below the carrying value due to a decrease in projected revenue growth rates the impairment charge is included in the marmaxx segment 

loss on early extinguishment of debt 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2017  we issued 10 billion of 225 tenyear notes we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem our 375 million 695 notes on october 12 2016 prior to their scheduled maturity of april 15 2019 and we recorded a pretax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of 518 million 

pension settlement charge 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2019  we annuitized and transferred current pension obligations for certain us retirees and beneficiaries under the qualified pension plan through the purchase of a group annuity contract with an insurance company we transferred 2074 million of pension plan assets to the insurance company thereby reducing our pension benefit obligations the transaction had no cash impact to tjx but did result in a noncash pretax pension settlement charge of 361 million  

during the third quarter of fiscal 2017  we offered eligible former tjx associates who had not yet commenced receiving their qualified pension plan benefit an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit as a result tjx’s qualified pension plan paid 1032 million from pension plan assets to those who accepted this offer this transaction had no cash impact to tjx but did result in a noncash pretax pension settlement charge of 312 million  

interest expense net 

the components of interest expense net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 



the decrease in interest expense net for fiscal 2019  and fiscal 2018  was driven by additional interest income primarily due to higher return rates 

provision for income taxes 

our effective annual income tax rate was 267  in fiscal 2019  324  in fiscal 2018  and 383  in fiscal 2017  the decrease in the fiscal 2019 effective income tax rate is primarily driven by the reduction of the us federal statutory rate from 35 to 21 the decrease in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the favorable effect of the 2017 tax act excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation attributable to the adoption of asu 201609   compensation stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment   accounting  and the jurisdictional mix of income 

the 2017 tax act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code which impacted fiscal 2019  and fiscal 2018  including but not limited to reducing the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 in december 2017 the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 which allows a measurement period not to exceed one year to finalize the accounting for the income tax impacts of the 2017 tax act we completed our analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  and determined there was no material adjustment to the income tax expense 

net income and diluted earnings per share 

net income was 31 billion in fiscal 2019  compared to 26 billion in fiscal 2018  and 23  billion in fiscal 2017  diluted earnings per share were 243  in fiscal 2019   202  in fiscal 2018  and  173  in fiscal 2017  year over year results are impacted by numerous items that impact comparability as summarized below 



 

in addition foreign currency exchange rates had a neutral impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018 and a 002 positive impact in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 

our stock repurchase programs which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding benefited our earnings per share growth by approximately 3 in each fiscal year presented 

segment information 

we operate four main business segments our marmaxx segment tj maxx marshalls and tjmaxxcom and the homegoods segment homegoods and homesense both operate in the united states our tjx canada segment operates winners homesense and marshalls in canada and our tjx international segment operates tk maxx homesense and tkmaxxcom in europe and tk maxx in australia we also operate sierra formerly sierra trading post that operates sierracom and retail stores in the us the results of sierra are included in our marmaxx segment 

we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income or loss before general corporate expense loss on early extinguishment of debt the pension settlement charge and interest expense net “segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities the terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales these measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 

presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments 

us segments 

marmaxx 



net sales for marmaxx increase d 8  in fiscal 2019  on top of a 5   increase  in fiscal 2018  the fiscal 2019   increase  reflects a 7 increase from comp sales and a 1 increase from noncomp sales the sales increase of 5  in fiscal 2018  reflects a 2 increase from noncomp sales a 2 increase from the 53rd week and a 1 increase from comp sales comp sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2019  was primarily due to a 5  increase in customer traffic on top of a 3 increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2018  geographically comp sales were strong throughout most of the country as all regions posted a 5 comp or greater apparel outperformed home fashions in fiscal 2019  with both categories posting solid comp sales growth sales of our us ecommerce businesses represented approximately 3 of marmaxx’s net sales 

segment margin increase d to 135  in fiscal 2019  compared to 133  in fiscal 2018  this comparison is impacted by items impacting the fiscal 2018  segment margin primarily the sierra impairment charge which reduced last year’s segment margin by 04 percentage points marmaxx results for fiscal 2019  reflect an improvement due to expense leverage on the strong comp sales which was more than offset by higher incentive compensation accruals due to the stronger than expected operating performance and an increase in distribution costs and store wages collectively these items reduced the fiscal 2019  segment margin by 07 percentage points merchandise margin was essentially flat for fiscal 2019  compared to fiscal 2018  despite a significant increase in freight costs our us ecommerce businesses excluding the fiscal 2018  impairment charge did not have a significant impact on yearoveryear segment margin comparisons 

segment margin in fiscal 2018  was 133  compared to 141  in fiscal 2017  marmaxx results for fiscal 2018  reflect a 04 percentage point negative impact from the sierra impairment charge in addition higher store payroll costs primarily due to wage increases and higher distribution costs primarily due to processing more units collectively reduced segment margin by approximately 05 percentage points the fiscal 2018  segment margin was also negatively impacted by expense deleverage on the 1 comp sales but was favorably impacted by approximately 01 percentage point due to the 53 rd  week merchandise margin was flat for fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  our us ecommerce businesses excluding the impairment charge did not have a significant impact on yearoveryear segment margin comparisons

segment profit margin decrease d to 116  for fiscal 2019  compared to 132  for fiscal 2018  the decrease  in segment margin for fiscal 2019  includes a decline in merchandise margin due to increased freight costs in addition higher distribution center costs and higher store wage costs as well as costs in connection with investing in more stores collectively reduced segment margin by approximately 11 percentage points 

segment profit margin for fiscal 2018  was 132  compared to 139  for fiscal 2017  the decrease in segment margin for fiscal 2018  includes a decline in merchandise margin of 05 percentage points primarily as a result of increased freight costs in addition higher distribution center costs primarily due to opening a new distribution center higher store payroll costs primarily due to wage increases as well as costs in connection with opening more stores as compared to fiscal 2017  including our first homesense stores collectively reduced segment margin by approximately 08 percentage points these costs were partially offset by expense leverage on comp sales growth as well as the benefit of the 53 rd  week which lifted segment margin by approximately 02 percentage points 

in fiscal 2020  we plan an increase of approximately 65 homegoods stores and 15 homesense stores which would increase selling square footage by approximately 11 

foreign segments 

tjx canada 



net sales for tjx canada increase d 6  in fiscal 2019  on top of a 15   increase  in fiscal 2018  the increase  in sales for fiscal 2019  reflects comp sales growth of 4  and a 4  increase from noncomp sales offset by a 2  negative impact of foreign currency translation the increase in sales for fiscal 2018  reflects comp sales growth of 5 a 5 increase from noncomp stores a 3 positive impact of foreign currency translation and a 2 impact of the 53 rd  week the comp sales increase in fiscal 2019  was due to a 5 increase in customer traffic on top of a 5 increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2018  

segment profit margin decrease d to 143  in fiscal 2019  compared to 146  in fiscal 2018  the decrease  in segment margin was primarily due to the combination of a higher store wage and freight costs partially offset by expense leverage on the strong comp sales

segment profit margin decrease d 03 percentage points to 51  in fiscal 2018  compared to 54  in fiscal 2017  the decrease  in segment margin was driven by higher supply chain costs associated with the opening of a new distribution center and higher store payroll which collectively reduced segment margin by approximately 07 percentage points segment margin was also negatively impacted by expense deleverage on the 2 comp sales growth these declines in segment margin were partially offset by a favorable impact of 04 percentage points due to foreign currency primarily the marktomarket impact of the inventory derivatives as well as the benefit of the 53 rd week which lifted the segment margin by approximately 02 percentage points 

we expect to add approximately 50 stores to tjx international in fiscal 2020  which would increase selling square footage by approximately 5 

general corporate expense 



general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments general corporate expenses are primarily included in sga expenses the marktomarket adjustment of our fuel hedges is included in cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs 

the increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2019  was primarily driven by incremental systems and technology costs global it restructuring costs and higher incentive compensation accruals collectively these items increased general corporate expense by approximately 100 million these increases were partially offset by the absence in fiscal 2019 of the associate related investments of approximately 70 million incurred in fiscal 2018  associated with the 2017 tax act 

the increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2018  was primarily driven by the incremental investments related to the 2017 tax act these investments include a discretionary bonus to eligible nonbonus plan associates additional retirement plan contributions and contributions to tjx’s charitable foundations which totaled 100 million in fiscal 2018  

liquidity and capital resources 

our liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations supplemented as needed by shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper as of february 2 2019  there were no shortterm bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding 

we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents internally generated funds and our credit facilities described in note j – longterm debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year 

as of february 2 2019  tjx held  30 billion in cash approximately 12 billion  of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with 4206 million  held in countries where we provisionally intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings tjx has provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in canada puerto rico italy india hong kong and vietnam through february 2 2019  if we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 41 billion in fiscal 2019   30 billion in fiscal 2018  and 36 billion in fiscal 2017  the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2019   increased  by 11 billion  compared to fiscal 2018  net income adjusted for noncash items increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2019  as compared to fiscal 2018  by 05 billion in addition there was a 06 billion increase in cash flows related to prepaid expenses and other current assets largely due to the prefunding of certain service contracts in fiscal 2018 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2018  decreased by 06 billion compared to fiscal 2017  net income adjusted for noncash items increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2018  as compared to fiscal 2017  by 03 billion this increase in cash flows was more than offset by a 03 billion decrease in cash flows related to merchandise inventories net of related accounts payable a 03 billion decrease in cash flows related to accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and a 03 billion decrease in cash flows related to accrued expenses and other liabilities merchandise inventories net of related accounts payable increased in fiscal 2018  due in part to the lower inventory levels we carried at fiscal 2017  year end the increase in accounts receivable was driven by credit card receivables the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the prefunding of certain service contracts as well as the timing of rent payments which was impacted by the timing in our fiscal year end dates the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities was driven by a reduction in sales taxes and income taxes payable primarily due to timing of payments and benefits associated with the 2017 tax act as well as a contribution of 100 million to the company’s defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2018  as compared to 50 million in fiscal 2017  

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 06 billion in fiscal 2019  10 billion in fiscal 2018  and 12 billion in fiscal 2017  the cash outflows were primarily driven by capital expenditures and in addition the activity in fiscal 2019 reflects the liquidation of shortterm investments by tjx canada as a result of a repatriation of earnings completed during the second quarter 

net cash used in investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below 



we expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2020  will be approximately 15 billion including approximately 900 million for our offices and distribution centers including buying and merchandising systems and other information systems to support growth approximately 400 million for store renovations and approximately 200 million for new stores we plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds 

in fiscal 2019  we purchased  02 billion of investments compared to  09 billion in fiscal 2018  additionally  06 billion of investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2019  compared to  09 billion in the prior year this activity primarily relates to shortterm investments which had initial maturities in excess of 90 days and per our policy are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of  31 billion in fiscal 2019   23 billion in fiscal 2018  and  16 billion in fiscal 2017  these cash outflows were primarily driven by equity repurchases partially offset by issuances dividend payments and debt transactions 

equity 

tjx repurchased and retired 518 million  shares of its common stock at a cost of 25 billion  during fiscal 2019  on a “trade date basis” tjx reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis under our stock repurchase programs we spent 24 billion to repurchase 508 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2019  16 billion to repurchase 444 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2018  and 17 billion to repurchase 446 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2017  

for further information regarding equity repurchases see note d – capital stock and earnings per share of notes to consolidated financial statements 

in february 2019  our board of directors approved an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional 15 billion  of tjx stock we currently plan to repurchase approximately 175 billion to 225 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2020  we determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow liquidity economic and market conditions our assessment of prospects for our business legal requirements and other factors the timing and amount of these purchases may change 

dividends 

we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled  078  per share in fiscal 2019   0625  per share in fiscal 2018  and  052  per share in fiscal 2017  cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 923 million in fiscal 2019  764 million in fiscal 2018  and 651 million in fiscal 2017  we also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 255 million in fiscal 2019  134 million in fiscal 2018  and 164 million in fiscal 2017  we expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2020  of 023 per share or an annual dividend of 092 per share subject to the declaration and approval of our board of directors this would represent an 18 increase over the per share dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2019  

debt 

during the fiscal 2017 third quarter we received net proceeds of 9925 million  from the issuance of 1 billion of 225 tenyear notes a portion of the proceeds were used to redeem our 375 million 695 notes prior to their scheduled maturity the redemption of the notes including the prepayment penalty resulted in cash outflows of 426 million 

for further information regarding debt see note j – longterm debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations 

as of february 2 2019  we had known contractual obligations under longterm debt arrangements including current installments other longterm obligations operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows 



 we also have longterm liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include 4491 million  for employee compensation and benefits and 2355 million  for uncertain tax positions 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgme nts to be those relating to the areas described below 

inventory valuation 

we use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except tk maxx in australia the businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale ie inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced typically a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns however as a normal business practice we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end historically the variance between estimated shrinkage and actual shrinkage has not been material to our annual financial results we do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and tradenames 

we evaluate our longlived assets goodwill and tradenames for indicators of impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores as well as of our business units which involve a number of factors including historical trends recent performance and general economic assumptions if we determine that an impairment of longlived assets or tradenames has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets if we determine that an impairment of goodwill has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit over the estimated fair value of the reporting unit but not in excess of the carrying amount of goodwill we determine the fair value of our business units using the discounted cash flow method which requires assumptions for the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” and revenue growth for the related business unit the fair value of our business units exceeds their carrying value by a significant amount 

reserves for uncertain tax positions 

like many large corporations our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation assessment examination litigation and settlement the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain in accordance with gaap we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the positions we have taken will not be sustained however in the next twelve months and in future periods the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay as the result of the final resolutions of examinations judicial or administrative proceedings changes in facts law or legal interpretations expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of or changes in tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made such as the recently enacted 2017 tax act final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

the 2017 tax act significantly changes how corporations are taxed requiring complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions and significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation as we continue our analysis of the 2017 tax act collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance we may make adjustments to amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made 

loss contingencies 

certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our management with the assistance of our legal counsel assesses such contingent liabilities such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable

opportunistic buying as an offprice retailer our buying practices which we refer to as opportunistic buying differentiate us from traditional retailers our overall global buying strategy is to acquire merchandise on an ongoing basis that will enable us to offer a desirable and rapidly changing mix of branded designer and other quality merchandise in our stores at prices below regular prices for comparable merchandise at fullprice retailers including department specialty and major online retailers we seek out and select merchandise from the broad range of opportunities in the marketplace to achieve this end our global buying organization which numbers more than 1000 associates in 16 buying offices in 12 countries executes this opportunistic buying strategy buying merchandise from more than 100 countries in a variety of ways depending on market conditions and other factors 

we take advantage of opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from the production and flow of inventory in the apparel and home fashions marketplace these opportunities include among others order cancellations manufacturer overruns closeouts from brands manufacturers and other retailers and special production direct from brands and factories our global buying strategies are intentionally flexible to allow us to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market and to adjust how and what we source as well as when we source it our goal is to operate with lean inventory levels compared to conventional retailers to give us the flexibility to seek out and to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise in contrast to traditional retailers which tend to order most of their goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor our merchants generally remain in the marketplace for goods throughout the year frequently looking for opportunities to buy merchandise we buy much of our merchandise for the current or immediately upcoming selling season we also buy some merchandise that is available in the market 

  

with the intention of storing it for sale typically in future selling seasons we generally make these purchases referred to as packaway in response to opportunities in the marketplace to buy merchandise that we believe has the right combination of brand fashion price and quality to supplement the product we expect to be available to purchase later for those future seasons we also acquire some merchandise that we offer under inhouse brands or brands that are licensed to us we develop some of this merchandise ourselves in order to supplement the depth of or fill gaps in our expected merchandise assortment 

our expansive vendor universe which is in excess of 20000 consists primarily of manufacturers as well as retailers and other vendors and provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quality merchandise for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments and expect this will continue as we continue to grow we believe a number of factors provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise and make us an attractive channel for many vendors in the market we are typically willing to purchase lessthanfull assortments of items styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large we are able to disperse merchandise across our geographically diverse network of stores and to target specific markets we pay promptly we generally do not ask for typical retail concessions such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries or return privileges and we have financial strength and an excellent credit rating 

inventory management we offer our customers a rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a treasure hunt experience in our stores and to spur frequent customer visits to achieve this we seek to turn the inventory in our stores rapidly regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions at excellent values our specialized inventory planning purchasing monitoring and markdown systems coupled with distribution center storage processing handling and shipping systems enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local preferences and demographics achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of products and generally sell within the period we planned we make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations centrally using information provided by specialized computer systems designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner we continue to invest in our supply chain with the goal of continuing to operate with low inventory levels to ship more efficiently and quickly and to more precisely and effectively allocate merchandise to each store 

pricing our mission is to offer quality fashionable brand name and designer merchandise in our stores with retail prices that are generally 20 to 60 below fullprice retailers’ including department specialty and major online retailers regular prices on comparable merchandise every day we do not generally engage in promotional pricing activity such as sales or coupons we have generally been able to react to price fluctuations in the wholesale market to maintain our pricing gap relative to prices offered by traditional retailers as well as our merchandise margins through various economic cycles 

low cost operations we operate with a low cost structure compared to many traditional retailers we focus aggressively on expenses throughout our business our advertising is generally focused on promoting our retail banners rather than individual products including at times promoting multiple banners together which contributes to our advertising budget as a percentage of sales remaining low compared to many traditional retailers we design our stores to provide a pleasant convenient shopping environment but relative to other retailers do not spend heavily on store fixtures additionally our distribution network is designed to run cost effectively 

customer serviceshopping experience we continue to renovate and upgrade our stores across our retail banners to enhance our customers’ shopping experience and help drive sales although we offer a selfservice format we train our store associates to provide friendly and helpful customer service and seek to staff our stores to deliver a positive shopping experience we typically offer customerfriendly return policies we accept a variety of payment methods including cash credit cards and debit cards we also offer tjxbranded credit cards in the us through a bank but do not own the customer receivables

 item 1a risk factors tableend the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks that follow are those that we think individually or in the aggregate could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements 

failure to execute our opportunistic buying strategy and inventory management could adversely affect our results 

while opportunistic buying operating with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are key elements of our offprice business strategy they subject us to risks related to the pricing quantity mix nature and timing of inventory flowing to our stores our merchants are in the marketplace frequently as much of our merchandise is purchased for the current or immediately upcoming season and our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion with them our business model expects them to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market assess the desirability and value of merchandise and generally make determinations of how and what we source as well as when we source it if we do not obtain the right merchandise at the right times in the right quantities at the right prices and in the right mix our customer traffic as well as our sales and margins could be adversely affected 

we base our purchases of inventory in part on our sales forecasts if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory leading to decreased profit margins or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales either of which could adversely affect our financial performance 

if we are unable to generally purchase inventory at prices sufficiently below prices paid by conventional retailers we may not be able to maintain an overall pricing differential to fullprice retailers including department specialty and major online retailers and our ability to attract customers or sustain our margins may be adversely affected we may not achieve this pricing differential at various times or in some reporting segments chains or geographies which could adversely affect our results 

similarly we must also properly execute our inventory management strategy of distributing the right merchandise to the right stores in the right quantities at the right time to respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns we need to appropriately allocate and deliver merchandise to our stores maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store and appropriately change the allocation of floor space at our stores among product categories if we are not able to do so our ability to attract and retain customers and our results could be adversely affected 

failure to continue to expand our business and operations successfully or to manage our substantial size and scale effectively could adversely affect our financial results 

our growth strategy includes successfully expanding our offprice model within our current markets and into new geographic regions product lines and channels and as appropriate adding new businesses whether by 

  

development investment or acquisition there are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand successfully and managing the implementation of this growth effectively if any aspect of our expansion strategy does not achieve the success we expect in whole or in part we may fail to meet our financial performance expectations be required to increase our investment slow our planned growth or close stores or operations for example if we are not able to find and lease appropriate real estate on attractive terms in the locations where we seek to open stores we may need to slow our planned growth in those areas similarly new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores whether in current or new markets and adding stores or banners to existing markets may otherwise adversely affect our sales and profitability 

further our substantial size can make it challenging to manage our complex operations effectively and to maintain appropriate internal resources and third party providers to support our business effectively these challenges may increase as we grow our business adding pressure to management and to various functions across our business including administration systems merchandising store operations distribution logistics and compliance as well as putting pressure on appropriately staffing and training associates in these areas as we grow andor managing appropriate third party providers to support these areas the large size and scale of our operations our multiple banners and locations across the us canada europe and australia and the autonomy afforded to the banners in some aspects of the business also increases the risk that our systems controls practices and policies may not be implemented effectively or consistently throughout our company and that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations these risks may increase as we continue to grow particularly if we expand into additional countries if business information is not shared effectively or if we are otherwise unable to manage our size or growth effectively our business may be adversely affected or we may need to reduce our rate of expansion of one or more operations or otherwise curtail growth in one or more markets which may adversely affect our success in executing our business goals and adversely impact our sales and results 

failure to identify consumer trends and preferences to meet customer demand in new or existing markets or channels could negatively impact our performance 

as our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand and expectations we work to identify consumer trends and preferences on an ongoing basis and to offer inventory and a shopping experience that meets those trends and preferences however doing so effectively and on a timely basis across our diverse merchandise categories and in each of the many markets in the us canada europe and australia in which we do business is challenging trends and preferences in markets may differ from what we anticipate although our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer preferences and trends for example by expanding and contracting merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes we may not successfully do so which could add difficulty in attracting new customers retaining existing customers encouraging frequent visits and adversely affect our results 

customers may also have expectations about how they shop in stores or through ecommerce or more generally engage with businesses across different channels through technology including internetbased and other digital or mobile channels or particular forms of social media outlets which may vary across demographics and may evolve rapidly overall consumer spending online also continues to grow meeting these expectations effectively involves identifying the right opportunities and making the right investments at the right time and with the right speed among other things and failure to do so may impact our financial results 

if we fail to successfully implement our various marketing efforts or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise may be influenced by our marketing efforts although we use marketing to drive customer traffic through various media including television radio print outdoor digitalsocial media email mobile and direct mail some of our competitors expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage further we may not effectively implement strategies with respect to rapidly evolving internetbased and other digital or mobile communication channels including social media our programs may not be or remain effective or could require increased expenditures which could have a significant adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 

  

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the retail apparel and home fashion businesses are highly competitive we compete with local regional national and international retailers that sell apparel home fashions and other merchandise we sell including in stores through ecommerce catalogues or other media or channels some of our competitors are larger than we are or have more experience in selling certain product lines than we do new competitors frequently enter the market and existing competitors enter or increase their presence in the markets in which we operate expand their merchandise offerings add new sales channels or change their pricing strategies all of which affect the competitive landscape consumer spending online has increased and may continue to increase while our business is primarily in stores we compete on the basis of various factors affecting value meaning the combination of brand fashion price and quality merchandise selection and freshness banner name recognition and appeal both instore and online service and shopping experience and store location if we fail to compete effectively our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 

failure to employ quality associates in appropriate numbers and to retain key associates and management could adversely affect our performance 

our performance depends on recruiting hiring developing training and retaining talented associates in key areas such as buying and management as well as quality store systems distribution center and other associates in large numbers we must constantly recruit new associates to fill entry level and parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover availability and skill of associates may differ across markets in which we do business and in new markets we enter and we may be unable to manage our labor needs effectively in addition because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must provide significant internal training and development for key associates across the company including within our buying organization similar to other retailers we face challenges in securing and retaining sufficient talent in management and other key areas for many reasons including competition in the retail industry and for talent in various geographic markets if we do not effectively attract qualified individuals train them in our business model support their development and retain them in sufficient numbers and at appropriate levels of the organization our growth could be limited and our performance could be adversely affected 

labor costs including pension and healthcare costs and other challenges from our large workforce may adversely affect our results and profitability 

we have a large workforce and our ability to meet our labor needs and control labor costs is subject to various factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates and benefit levels minimum wage laws and benefits requirements and other market pressures on wages and benefits changing demographics economic conditions interest rate changes economic demographic and other actuarial assumptions the costs of providing and managing retirement health and other employee benefits including health and insurance costs and a dynamic regulatory environment including health care legislation immigration law and policy and governmental labor employment and employee benefits programs and requirements changes to one or more of these factors could increase our labor costs 

increased labor costs may adversely affect our results of operations in addition when wage rates or benefit levels increase in a market increasing our wages or benefits may negatively impact our earnings as they did during the past three fiscal years while failing to increase our wages or benefits competitively or reducing our wages or benefits could result in a decline in our ability to attract or retain associates or in the quality of our workforce causing our customer service or performance to suffer which could impact our results many associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore we are subject to the risk of labor actions of various kinds as well as risks and potential material expenses associated with multiemployer plans including from pension plan underfunding benefit cuts increased contribution requirements changes in plan terms withdrawal liability or insolvency of other participating employers or governmental insurance programs other associates in europe are members of works councils which may subject us to additional requirements actions or expense 

  

compromises of our data security could materially harm our reputation and business 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect store process and transmit confidential business information and certain information relating to individuals such as our customers associates and vendors including for example customer payment card and check information and other personal data we rely in part on commercially available systems software hardware services tools and monitoring to provide security for collection storage processing and transmission of personal andor confidential information as with many other companies in the retail industry we are subject to attempts to compromise our data security for example computer hackers have attempted and we expect will continue to attempt to penetrate our computer systems or those of third parties with whom we work or to whom we outsource business operations if successful such computer hackers may further attempt to misappropriate personal information or confidential business information andor to disrupt our business operations while we have taken steps designed to further strengthen the security of our computer systems since the unauthorized intrusions into our network discovered late in 2006 in which we believe customer data were stolen there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a future data security compromise that unauthorized parties will not gain access to the information that we collect store process or transmit or otherwise interfere with our systems or that any such data security compromise or unauthorized access will be discovered in a timely way or resolved without a disruption to our business 

in addition an associate contractor or third party with whom we work or to whom we outsource business operations may fail to monitor their or our systems effectively may fail to maintain appropriate safeguards may misuse the personal or confidential information to which they have access may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to access or misappropriate such types of information may purposefully or inadvertently allow unauthorized access to our systems or to personal or confidential information or may otherwise disrupt our business operations advances in computer and software technology and capabilities rapid changes in the sources methods and targets of cyberattacks for example malware ransomware and phishing attacks and the use of devices to tamper with payment entry devices such as skimmers and shimmers and the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals generally increase the risk of a data compromise or business disruption 

compromise of our data security or that of third parties with whom we work or to whom we outsource business operations including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods or error failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business information and delays in detecting any such compromise or loss could among other adverse impacts to our business disrupt our operations damage our reputation and decrease our customers’ willingness to shop in our stores or online impact our ability to attract and retain customers violate applicable laws regulations orders and agreements and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material 

failure to operate information systems and to implement new technologies effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information systems including data centers telecommunications systems hardware software and applications to manage many aspects of our business including to process and record transactions in our stores and our ecommerce sites to manage our customer vendor and associate data to enable effective communication systems to source plan and track inventory to manage logistics to generate performance and financial reports to comply with regulatory requirements and to otherwise operate our ecommerce sites we are dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems supporting these internal and external systems requires a number of resources including effective and qualified and in some cases specialized teams as we grow and as our systems evolve we must continue to hire train manage and retain these teams including those needed to support our customized and legacy systems in an effective way our information systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on may be subjected to damage or interruption from a number of causes including power outages system failures cyberattacks including malware ransomware and phishing attacks and devices to tamper with our payment or other systems including skimmers and shimmers catastrophic events and design or usage errors by our associates contractors or third party service providers on which we rely although we have taken steps designed to reduce the risk of these events occurring there can be no guarantee that we or a third party on 

  

which we rely will not suffer one of these events our approach to disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be adequate and any compromises interruptions or shutdowns of our systems including those managed andor operated by third parties whether intentional or inadvertent could lead to delays in our business operations and if significant or extreme affect our results of operations cause us to suffer reputational harm or result in liability 

we modify update and replace our systems and infrastructure from time to time including by adding new hardware software and applications maintaining updating or replacing legacy programs converting to global systems integrating new service providers adding enhanced or new functionality such as cloud computing technologies and ecommerce solutions and adding or integrating with new systems when we acquire new businesses we also modify and update our procedures for and add vendors and internal teams who assist us with designing implementing and maintaining our systems and infrastructure there is a risk of business disruption liability and reputational damage associated with these actions including from not accurately capturing and maintaining data efficiently testing and implementing changes realizing the expected benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption of the actions and diversion of internal teams’ attention as the changes are implemented 

further potential issues associated with implementing technology initiatives and the time and resources required in seeking to optimize the benefits of new elements of our systems and its infrastructure could reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends upon our information systems including our ability to operate maintain and develop them effectively a failure of those systems could disrupt our business subject us to liability damage our reputation or otherwise impact our financial results 

economic conditions on a global level or in particular markets may adversely affect our financial performance 

global financial markets can experience volatility disruption and credit contraction which could adversely affect global economic conditions turmoil in the financial and credit markets or other changes in economic conditions could adversely affect sources of liquidity available to us or our costs of capital and could adversely affect plan asset values and investment performance and increase our pension liabilities expenses and funding requirements and other related financial exposure with respect to companysponsored and multiemployer pension plans our strategies for managing these financial risks and exposures may not be effective or sufficient economic conditions both on a global level and in particular markets including unemployment decreased disposable income and actual and perceived wealth energy and health care costs costs of oil gas and other commodities interest and tax rates and policies weakness in the housing market volatility in capital markets decreased credit availability inflation and deflation as well as political or other factors beyond our control such as threats or possibilities of war terrorism global or national unrest actual or threatened epidemics geopolitical instability or uncertainty and regulatory volatility or uncertainty including in areas like international trade for example discussions regarding brexit may also have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending that would in turn affect retail sales these conditions and factors could adversely affect discretionary consumer spending and although we believe our flexible offprice model helps us react they may adversely affect our sales cash flows and results of operations and performance 

adverse or unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate or along our supply chain could adversely affect our operating results 

both adverse and unseasonable weather such as storms severe cold or heat or unseasonable temperatures even if not extreme may affect customers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop certain categories we offer or at all and accordingly can adversely affect the demand for the merchandise in our stores particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise as discussed further below adverse weather can also affect the efficient or timely transportation of merchandise to our distribution and shipping centers stores and ecommerce customers or elsewhere along our supply chain and may impact transportation to or from our stores and other facilities as a result adverse or unseasonable weather could adversely affect our sales increase markdowns impact customer satisfaction and adversely affect our operating results 

  

our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic events 

natural or other disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other extreme weather climate conditions unforeseen public health issues such as pandemics and epidemics or fires explosions and acts of war or terrorism could disrupt our operations in a number of ways including severely damaging or destroying one or more of our stores distribution facilities or data centers or could disrupt the operations of one or more of our vendors or other parts of our supply chain located in the affected areas daytoday operations including our ability to receive products from our vendors or transport products to our stores or to our ecommerce customers could be adversely affected transportation to and from our stores by customers or associates could be limited or we could be required to close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by affected distribution centers for a short or extended period of time as we did in areas of the us including puerto rico after severe hurricanes during fiscal 2018 as a result our business could be adversely affected 

damage to our corporate reputation or those of our retail banners could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

we believe that building the brand reputation of our company and our retail banners is important to our continuing success in the many different markets in which we do business we work to build relationships with our customers through our various marketing campaigns and other activities these relationships and our reputation are based in part on perceptions of subjective qualities incidents involving us our retail banners our executives or other associates our policies and practices the merchandise and brands including our licensed or owned brands that we carry or our industry more generally that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business particularly if the incidents result in rapid or significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry information about us our retail banners our executives and other associates our policies and practices our third party providers and the merchandise and brands we sell including our licensed or owned brands that is publicized through traditional or digital media platforms and similar venues including blogs websites and other forums for rapid broad communications to an audience of consumers and other interested persons may adversely affect our reputation and brand even if the information is inaccurate incomplete or unverified the reputation of our company and our retail banners may be damaged in all one or some of the markets in which we do business by adverse events at the corporate level or at our retail banners or by an associate acting outside of company policies and practices similarly challenges or reactions to action or inaction perceived action or inaction by our company on issues like social policies merchandising compliance related to social product labor and environmental standards or other sensitive topics and any perceived lack of transparency about such matters could harm our reputation particularly as expectations of companies and of companies’ corporate responsibility may continue to change damage to the reputation of our company and our banners could result in declines in customer loyalty and sales affect our vendor relationships business development opportunities and associate retention divert attention and resources from management including to respond to inquiries or additional regulatory scrutiny and otherwise adversely affect our results 

quality safety or other issues with merchandise we sell could damage our reputation sales and financial results 

various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we sell to consumers regulations and standards in this area including those related to the us consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 and the us food safety modernization act state regulations like california’s proposition 65 and similar legislation in other countries in which we operate impose restrictions and requirements on the merchandise we sell in our stores and through ecommerce these regulations change from time to time and new federal state provincial or local regulations in the us and other countries that may affect our business are contemplated and enacted with some regularity if we or our merchandise vendors are unable to comply with regulatory requirements on a timely basis or at all or to adequately monitor new regulations that may apply to existing or new merchandise categories or in new geographies we could incur significant fines or penalties or we could have to curtail some aspects of our sales or operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results we rely on our vendors to 

  

provide quality merchandise that complies with applicable product safety laws labeling requirements and other applicable laws but they may not comply with their obligations to do so although our arrangements with our vendors frequently provide for indemnification for product liabilities the vendors may fail to honor those obligations to an extent we consider sufficient or at all concerns or issues with the quality and safety of merchandise raised publicly particularly with products subject to increased levels of regulation or the genuineness of merchandise regardless of whether verified or our fault could cause damage to our reputation and could result in lost sales uninsured claims or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs and regulatory civil or criminal fines or penalties any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

failure to comply with laws rules regulations and orders and applicable accounting principles and interpretations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

we are subject to federal state provincial regional and local laws rules and regulations as well as government orders in various countries in which we operate these legal regulatory and administrative requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business including the cost of providing health care and retirement benefits workforce management logistics marketing importexport sourcing and manufacturing tax data protection and others if we or third parties that perform services on our behalf fail to comply with applicable laws rules regulations and orders we may be subject to judgments fines or other costs or penalties which could adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition 

complying with applicable laws rules and regulations and our own internal policies may also require us to spend additional time and resources to implement new procedures and financial and other controls conduct audits train associates and third parties on our compliance methods or take other actions particularly as we continue to grow globally and enter new markets or countries any of which could adversely impact our results 

we must also comply with new and changing laws rules and regulations evolving interpretation of existing laws by judicial and regulatory authorities and reforms in jurisdictions where we do business these changes could increase our costs of compliance or of doing business and could adversely affect our operating results including such changes involving 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 particularly in a dynamic regulatory environment anticipated changes to laws and regulations may require us to invest in compliance efforts before changes are certain 

further applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time and the changes could have material effects on our future or previously reported financial results 

our expanding international operations expose us to risks inherent in operating in new countries 

we have a significant retail presence in canada and in countries in europe and operate buying offices around the world we have expanded our operations into australia and our goal is to continue to expand our operations into other countries in the future it can be costly and complex to establish develop and maintain international operations and promote business in new international jurisdictions which may differ significantly from other countries in which we currently operate 

  

in addition to facing risks similar to our us and current international operations such as with regulations like the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act there are additional risks inherent in opening and developing operations in new countries these additional risks include among others understanding the local retail climate and trends local customs and cultures seasonal differences business practices and competitive conditions complying with relevant laws rules and regulations developing the appropriate infrastructure identifying suitable partners for local operations and for integration with our global operations and effectively communicating and implementing company policies and practices in new possibly remote jurisdictions there are also financial regulatory and other risks associated with international operations including currency exchange fluctuations potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds outside of the country where earned trade regulations the risk of sudden policy or regulatory changes the risk of political economic and civil instability and labor unrest and uncertainties regarding interpretation application and enforceability of laws and agreements any of these risks could adversely impact our operations profitability or liquidity 

we are subject to risks associated with sourcing merchandise from other countries and moving merchandise internationally 

many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a lesser extent by us in many locations outside of the country where the particular store is located particularly southeastern asia where we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements including those similar to requirements imposed upon the manufacturer of such products more generally we are subject to various risks of sourcing merchandise from other countries including moving merchandise internationally such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these and other factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise beyond our control could affect the availability and the price of our inventory and our operating costs furthermore although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to 

  

international operations and importing merchandise there can be no assurance that our associates and our contractors agents vendors or other third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our reputation operations or operating results 

our results may be adversely affected by reduced availability of or increases in the price of oil or other fuels increased costs of other commodities or other increases in utility transportation or logistics costs 

energy and fuel costs can fluctuate dramatically and at times have resulted in significant cost increases particularly for the price of oil and gasoline an increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers although we typically enter into derivative instruments designed to manage a portion of our transportation costs a hedging strategy any such strategy may not be effective or sufficient and could result in increased operating costs increased regulation related to environmental costs including cap and trade carbon taxes or other emissions management systems could also adversely affect our costs of doing business including utility transportation and logistics costs as could other shortages or disruptions impacting transportation for example at the end of fiscal 2018 increased freight cost related to labor and equipment shortages as well as other factors had an impact on our margins similarly other commodity prices can fluctuate dramatically such increases can increase the cost of merchandise which could adversely affect our performance through potentially reduced consumer demand or reduced margins 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and changes in currency exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into us dollars for financial reporting purposes because of this movements in currency exchange rates have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our consolidated and segment results from time to time changes in currency exchange rates can also increase the cost of inventory purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the business buying the merchandise when exchange rates change significantly in a short period or move unfavorably over an extended period as in recent years it can be difficult for us to adjust retail prices accordingly and gross margin can be adversely affected in addition a significant amount of merchandise we offer for sale is made in china and accordingly a revaluation of chinese currency or increased market flexibility in the exchange rate for that currency increasing its value relative to the us dollar or currencies in which our stores are located could be significant 

additionally we routinely enter into inventoryrelated derivative instruments a hedging strategy to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rates on merchandise margins of merchandise purchases by our segments denominated in currencies other than their local currencies in accordance with gaap we evaluate the fair value of these derivative instruments and make marktomarket adjustments at the end of each accounting period these adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our earnings 

although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates we expect that currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations from time to time in addition fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our earnings and operating results if a counterparty to one of our hedging arrangements fails to perform 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate and may fall short of prior periods our projections or the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past and they may do so in the future if we fail to increase our results over prior periods to achieve our projected results or to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price may decline and the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance results may be affected by various factors 

  

including those described in these risk factors we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to plan sales and align expenses if we do not control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results or if actual results differ significantly from our forecast our financial performance could be adversely affected in addition if we do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplated pursuant to our stock repurchase programs our earnings per share may be adversely affected 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions or investments in new businesses or divest close or consolidate any of our current businesses our business will be subject to additional risks 

we may acquire new businesses as we did with trade secret in fiscal 2016 and stp in fiscal 2013 invest in or enter into joint ventures with other businesses develop new businesses internally as with homesense our new us home store concept and divest close or consolidate businesses failure to execute on mergers acquisitions investments divestitures closings and consolidations in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition acquisition investment or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses and we may not effectively evaluate target companies investments or investment partners or assess the risks benefits and cost of buying investing in or closing businesses or of the integration of acquired businesses all of which can be difficult timeconsuming and dilutive these activities may not meet our performance and other expectations and may expose us to unexpected or greaterthanexpected costs liabilities and risks in addition we recorded intangible assets and goodwill and the value of the tradenames in connection with our acquisitions of trade secret and stp and may similarly do so in the future in connection with other acquisitions if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions we may be required to impair some or all of the goodwill associated with an acquisition which would adversely impact our results of operations and balance sheet such as with the impairment charge related to stp taken during fiscal 2018 divestitures closings and consolidations could involve risks such as significant costs and obligations of closure including exposure on leases owned real estate and other contractual employment pension and severance obligations and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer 

our results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation legal proceedings and other legal or regulatory matters 

we are involved or may in the future become involved in legal proceedings regulatory reviews audits and other legal matters these may involve inquiries investigations lawsuits and other proceedings by local provincial state and federal governmental entities in the united states and other countries and private plaintiffs including with respect to employment and employee benefits including classification employment rights discrimination wage and hour and retaliation whistle blower claims tax securities disclosure real estate environmental matters tort business practices consumer protection privacydata security product safety and compliance advertising and intellectual property there continue to be employmentrelated and consumer protection lawsuits including putative class actions in the united states and we are subject to these types of suits we cannot predict the results of legal and regulatory proceedings with certainty and actual results may differ from any reserves we establish estimating the probable outcome regardless of merit or outcome litigation can be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expense and diversion of management attention legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations could expose us to significant defense costs fines penalties and liability to private parties and governmental entities for monetary recoveries and other amounts and attorneys’ fees andor require us to change aspects of our operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including the results of tax audits and examinations income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory income tax rates 

  

changes in income tax rates changes in transfer pricing changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in applicable tax legislation regulations and treaties exposure to additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision and accruals for taxes and actual results may differ from our estimations 

in december 2017 the us tax cut and jobs act of 2017 the “2017 tax act” significantly revised the current federal income tax code with significant changes to corporate taxation including reducing the corporate tax rate limiting certain tax deductions revising the treatment of foreign earnings for us federal income tax purposes and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits while the 2017 tax act reduces the federal income tax rate for corporations it could negatively affect our business and financial condition many aspects of the new tax law are uncertain significant judgements will need to be made in the interpretation of various provisions and us regulators could interpret or issue guidance that is different from our interpretation in addition it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law which could also impact our tax obligations 

in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state provincial and local tax authorities in the us and foreign countries and the examining authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various proceedings which are at various stages with such authorities with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these proceedings to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of our provision for income taxes and increase and decrease our provision as a result of these assessments however the developments in and actual results of proceedings or the result of rulings by or settlements with tax authorities and courts or due to changes in facts law or legal interpretations expiration of applicable statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions could differ from the amounts we have accrued for such proceedings in either a positive or a negative manner which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations in addition we are subject to tax audits and examinations for payroll value added salesbased and other taxes relating to our businesses 

as our business is subject to seasonal influences a decrease in sales or margins a severe disruption or other significant event that impacts our business during the second half of the year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operating results 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we generally realize higher levels of sales and earnings in the second half of the year which includes the backtoschool and yearend holiday seasons any decrease in sales or margins or any significant adverse event during this period including those described in the factors in this section could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations 

our real estate leases generally obligate us for long periods which subjects us to financial risks 

we lease virtually all of our store locations and either own or lease for long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices accordingly we are subject to the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate which can adversely affect our results while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions including by making specified payments we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so if we decide to close stores we are generally required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases which generally include among other things paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or paying to exercise rights to terminate and the performance of any of these obligations may be expensive when we assign leases or sublease space to third parties or if we sell a business we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform as was the case with some of our former operations in addition when the lease term for the stores in our ongoing operations expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially reasonable terms or at all which could cause us to close stores or to relocate stores within a market on less favorable terms 

  

failure to protect our inventory or other assets from loss and theft may impact our financial results 

risk of loss or theft of assets including inventory shrinkage is inherent in the retail apparel and home fashion businesses loss may be caused by error or misconduct of associates customers vendors or third parties our inability to effectively combat andor minimize the loss or theft of assets or to effectively reduce the impact of those losses could adversely affect our financial performance 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our operations growth stock repurchases and dividends and interest and debt repayment 

our business depends upon our operations to continue to generate strong cash flow to supply capital to support our general operating activities to fund our growth and our return of cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase programs and dividends and to pay our interest and debt repayments our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or to repatriate cash from our international operations in a manner that is cost effective could adversely affect our growth plans and financial performance including our earnings per share we borrow on occasion to finance our activities and if financing were not available to us in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed it could also adversely affect our financial performance

during the fourth quarter the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 referred to as “tax reform” or the “2017 tax act” was enacted the 2017 tax act along with the related reinvestments made by the company had a significant impact on our fiscal 2018 results see “ tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 ” below 

highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2018 include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results followed by a discussion of our segment operating results 

tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax act was enacted into law which among other things includes a onetime mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign undistributed earnings and a reduction of the us corporate income tax rate to 21 percent effective january 1 2018 the change in the us income tax rate also requires us to revalue our deferred tax assets and liabilities although we are still evaluating the impact of the 2017 tax act on tjx the company has estimated the impact of the 2017 tax act which resulted in a reduction of the full year tax provision the company has reinvested a portion of these tax benefits by approving a discretionary bonus to eligible nonbonus plan associates globally providing an incremental contribution to the company’s defined contribution retirement plans for eligible associates in the us and internationally as well as making contributions to the company’s charitable foundations collectively referred to as “incremental investments related to the 2017 tax act” the tax benefits recognized due to the 2017 tax act offset by the aftertax impact of incremental investments we made related to the 2017 tax act resulted in a net benefit to net income of 017 per share for the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and full year 

net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal 2018 totaled 359 billion an 8 increase over 332 billion in fiscal 2017 the increase reflected a 4 increase from new stores a 2 increase from comp sales and a 2 increase from the impact of the 53 rd week in the fiscal 2018 calendar foreign currency had a neutral impact in fiscal 2018 net sales from our ecommerce businesses amounted to approximately 2 of total sales and had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2018 sales growth consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017 totaled 332 billion a 7 increase over 309 billion in fiscal 2016 the increase reflected a 5 increase from comp sales and a 4 increase from new stores offset by a 2 negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates 

comparable store sales we define comparable store sales “comp sales” formerly referred to as samestore sales to be sales of stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation we calculate comp sales on a 52week basis by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that have changed in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated comp percentage is immaterial 

we define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the comp sales calculation and average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold we define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the comp sales calculation 

sales excluded from comp sales “noncomp sales” consists of 

 

  

  

 we determine which stores are included in the comp sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed permanently or for an extended period during that fiscal year in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 37 stores were significantly impacted by hurricanes mostly in puerto rico and were excluded from comp sales these stores will be included in the comp sales measures once they again meet the comp sales criteria 

comp sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year’s comp sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance 

comp sales may be referred to as “same store” sales by other retail companies the method for calculating comp sales varies across the retail industry therefore our measure of comp sales may not be comparable to other retail companies 

  

comp sales increases across all of our four segments for fiscal 2018 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic we also had an increase in the number of units sold which was more than offset by a reduction in the average ticket in fiscal 2018 home fashions and apparel both grew with home fashions performing better than apparel geographically in the us the southeast and the southwest regions reported the highest comp sales increase and the northeast was below the consolidated average in canada comp sales increases were well above the consolidated average and tjx international was at the consolidated average 

comp sales increases in the us for fiscal 2017 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic we also had an increase in units sold which was largely offset by a reduction in the average ticket in fiscal 2017 home fashions performed better than apparel but both recorded comp sales growth geographically in the us sales were strong in virtually all regions with the southeast and the great lakes regions reporting the highest comp sales growth in canada comp sales increases were well above the consolidated average while tjx international was below the consolidated average 

the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales 

 

  

 impact of foreign currency exchange rates  our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the us dollar or a division’s local currency in relation to other currencies two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows 

 

  

 we refer to the impact of the above two items throughout our discussion as “foreign currency” this does not include the impact currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a 

  

currency other than an operating division’s local currency when discussing the impact on our results of the effect of currency exchange rates on such transactions we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange” 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 711 in fiscal 2018 compared to 710 in fiscal 2017 and 712 in fiscal 2016 the increase in this expense ratio during fiscal 2018 was driven by higher supply chain costs as we continue to invest and open new distribution centers this was offset by the favorable impact of marktomarket of inventory derivatives that benefitted expense ratio by approximately 01 percentage point as well as an estimated 01 percentage point benefit from the 53rd week in the company’s fiscal 2018 calendar merchandise margin was flat to fiscal 2017 

the improvement in the fiscal 2017 expense ratio was driven by an increase in our merchandise margin along with leverage on buying and occupancy costs as a result of the 5 comp sales increase together these two items benefitted the fiscal 2017 expense ratio by approximately 05 percentage points merchandise margin improved despite the continued pressure transactional foreign exchange had on the cost of merchandise at our foreign segments this year versus the prior year although not as significant as in fiscal 2016 the change in exchange rates continued to impact the cost of merchandise that was denominated in currencies other than our foreign segments’ local currency primarily the us dollar these improvements were partially offset by higher supply chain costs and the negative impact of the marktomarket of inventory derivatives 

sga sga expenses as a percentage of net sales were 178 in fiscal 2018 174 in fiscal 2017 and 168 in fiscal 2016 the fiscal 2018 expense ratio increased by 03 percentage points due to the incremental investments related to the 2017 tax act the remaining increase in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher employee payroll costs due to wage increases 

the increase in this ratio in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a combination of higher employee payroll costs due to wage increases and investments to support our growth and supply chain costs partially offset by the favorable impact of reduced contributions to the tjx charitable foundations in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 

impairment of goodwill and other longlived assets related to stp our fiscal 2018 results included a 993 million impairment charge primarily related to goodwill as the estimated fair value of stp fell below the carrying value due to a decrease in projected revenue growth rates the impairment charge is included in the marmaxx segment as we continue transitioning this business to an offprice model we saw improvement in the top line during the second half of fiscal 2018 we remain confident in the potential of stp and believe we are positioned for successful growth going forward 

loss on early extinguishment of debt during the fiscal 2017 third quarter we issued 10 billion of 225 tenyear notes we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem our 375 million 695 notes on october 12 2016 prior to their scheduled maturity of april 15 2019 and we recorded a pretax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of 518 million 

pension settlement charge during the fiscal 2017 third quarter we offered eligible former tjx associates who had not yet commenced receiving their qualified pension plan benefit an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit as a result tjx’s qualified pension plan paid 1032 million from pension plan assets to those who accepted this offer this transaction had no cash impact on tjx but did result in a noncash pretax settlement charge of 312 million 

interest expense net the components of interest expense net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

 

   

the decrease in interest expense net for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was driven by additional interest income primarily due to an increase in invested balances and higher return rates 

income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was 324 in fiscal 2018 383 in fiscal 2017 and 377 in fiscal 2016 the decrease in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the favorable effect of the 2017 tax act excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation attributable to the adoption of asu 201609 compensation stock compensation topic 718 improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  and the jurisdictional mix of income the increase in the fiscal 2017 income tax rate was due to the jurisdictional mix of income and the valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses in addition the fiscal 2016 effective income tax rates benefitted from a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions related to our adoption of the new tangible property regulations 

the 2017 tax act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code which impacted fiscal 2018 including but not limited to reducing the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and requiring a onetime transition tax on certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries the provisional tax benefit of the 2017 tax act is based on currently available information and interpretations which are continuing to evolve we will continue to analyze additional information and guidance related to the 2017 tax act as supplemental legislation regulatory guidance or evolving technical interpretations become available the final impacts may differ from the recorded amounts as of february 3 2018 and we will continue to refine such amounts within the measurement period provided by staff accounting bulletin no 118 we expect to complete our analysis no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 

net income and diluted earnings per share net income was 26 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to 23 billion in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 diluted earnings per share were 404 in fiscal 2018 346 in fiscal 2017 and 333 in fiscal 2016 the tax benefits recognized due to the 2017 tax act offset by the aftertax impact of the incremental investments related to the 2017 tax act resulted in a net benefit to diluted earnings per share of 017 per share the impairment charge related to stp reduced fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share by 010 per share while the 53rd week in the fiscal 2018 calendar provided a benefit of approximately 011 per share foreign currency exchange rates had a 002 positive impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017 and a 007 negative impact in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 we incurred charges from the loss on early extinguishment of debt and the pension settlement collectively reducing fiscal 2017 net income by 50 million or 007 per share 

our stock repurchase programs which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding benefited our earnings per share growth by approximately 3 in each fiscal year presented we repurchased 223 million shares of our stock at a cost of 17 billion in both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 and 265 million shares of our stock at a cost of 18 billion in fiscal 2016 

segment information we operate four main business segments our marmaxx segment tj maxx marshalls and tjmaxxcom and the homegoods segment homegoods and homesense both operate in the united states our tjx canada segment operates winners homesense and marshalls in canada and our tjx international segment operates tk maxx homesense and tkmaxxcom in europe and tk maxx in australia we also operate stp an offprice internet retailer that operates sierratradingpostcom and retail stores in the us the results of stp have been included in our marmaxx segment 

we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income or loss before general corporate expense loss on early extinguishment of debt the pension settlement charge and interest expense net “segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities the terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales these measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 

  

presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments 

us segments 

marmaxx 

 

 net sales for marmaxx increased 5 in fiscal 2018 on top of a 7 increase in fiscal 2017 the increase reflects a 2 increase from new store sales a 2 increase from the 53 rd week and a 1 increase from comp sales the comp sales increase of 1 in fiscal 2018 is on top of a 5 increase in the prior year comp sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2018 was due to a 3 increase in customer traffic on top of a 4 increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2017 which was offset by a decrease in the average basket geographically comp sales were strong throughout most of the country with the southeast and southwest regions particularly strong and the northeast was below the segment average home fashions outperformed apparel for fiscal 2018 with apparel posting flat comp sales on top of strong comp sales in fiscal 2017 ecommerce sales represented approximately 2 of marmaxx’s net sales 

segment margin decreased to 133 in fiscal 2018 compared to 141 in fiscal 2017 marmaxx results for fiscal 2018 reflect a 04 percentage point negative impact from the stp impairment charge in addition higher store payroll costs primarily due to wage increases and higher distribution costs primarily due to processing more units collectively reduced segment margin by approximately 05 percentage points the fiscal 2018 segment margin was also negatively impacted by expense deleverage on the 1 comp sales but was favorably impacted by approximately 01 percentage point due to the 53 rd week merchandise margin was flat for fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 tjmaxxcom and stp excluding the impairment charge did not have a significant impact on yearoveryear segment margin comparisons 

segment margin in fiscal 2017 was 141 compared to 143 in fiscal 2016 marmaxx results for fiscal 2017 reflect an increase in merchandise margin and buying and occupancy expense leverage on comp sales growth of approximately 07 percentage points however these gains were more than offset by higher store payroll costs primarily due to wage increases and processing more units at the store level higher distribution costs as well as an increase in credit card chargeback costs tjmaxxcom and stp did not have a significant impact on yearoveryear segment margin comparisons 

in fiscal 2019 we expect to open approximately 65 marmaxx stores which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2 

  

homegoods 

 

 homegoods’ net sales increased 16 in fiscal 2018 on top of a 12 increase in fiscal 2017 the increase in fiscal 2018 reflected a 10 increase from new store sales a 4 increase from comp sales and a 2 increase due to the 53 rd week the sales increase of 12 in fiscal 2017 reflected a 6 increase from new store sales and a 6 increase from comp sales comp sales growth at homegoods for fiscal 2018 was due to a 4 increase in customer traffic on top of a 5 increase in customer traffic in fiscal 2017 comp sales growth in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 was also due to an increase in units sold which was partially offset by a decrease in the average ticket 

segment profit margin decreased to 132 for fiscal 2018 compared to 139 for fiscal 2017 the decrease in segment margin for fiscal 2018 includes a decline in merchandise margin of 05 percentage points primarily as a result of increased freight costs in addition higher distribution center costs primarily due to opening a new distribution center higher store payroll costs primarily due to wage increases as well as costs in connection with opening more stores as compared to fiscal 2017 including our first homesense stores collectively reduced segment margin by approximately 08 percentage points these costs were partially offset by expense leverage on comp sales growth as well as the benefit of the 53 rd week which lifted segment margin by approximately 02 percentage points 

segment profit margin for fiscal 2017 was 139 compared to 140 for fiscal 2016 segment margin for fiscal 2017 was favorably impacted by an increase in merchandise margin and expense leverage primarily occupancy costs on strong comp sales growth these increases in segment margin were more than offset by higher payroll costs related to wage increases an increase in distribution costs which includes the opening of a new distribution center in fiscal 2017 and an increase in credit card chargeback costs 

in fiscal 2019 we plan an increase of approximately 85 homegoods stores and 15 homesense stores which would increase selling square footage by approximately 18 

  

foreign segments 

tjx canada 

 

 net sales for tjx canada increased 15 in fiscal 2018 on top of an 11 increase in fiscal 2017 the increase in sales for fiscal 2018 reflected comp sales growth of 5 a 5 increase from new stores 3 from the positive impact of foreign currency translation and a 2 impact of the 53 rd week the increase in sales for fiscal 2017 reflected comp sales growth of 8 and a 5 increase from new stores offset by 2 from the negative impact of foreign currency translation the comp sales increases in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic 

segment profit margin increased 16 percentage points to 146 in fiscal 2018 compared to 130 in fiscal 2017 the increase in segment margin was primarily due to the combination of an increase in merchandise margin of 06 percentage points which benefitted from the yearoveryear increase in the canadian dollar and expense leverage on the strong comp sales the increase in the segment margin also included a favorable impact of 03 percentage points due to foreign currency primarily the marktomarket impact of the inventory derivatives the fiscal 2018 segment margin also benefitted from the 53 rd week which lifted the segment margin by approximately 01 percentage point 

segment profit margin decreased 01 percentage point to 130 in fiscal 2017 the decline in segment margin was driven by a decrease in merchandise margin and higher supply chain and distribution center costs which included the opening of a new distribution center the decline in merchandise margin was primarily due to transactional foreign exchange as the yearoveryear changes in currency exchange rates increased tjx canada’s cost of merchandise purchased in us dollars these declines in segment margin were largely offset by expense leverage primarily buying and occupancy costs on the comp sales growth as well as the benefit of transactional foreign currency activity resulting in foreign currency gains in fiscal 2017 as compared to foreign currency losses in fiscal 2016 these foreign currency gains and losses result from the timing and settlement of payables denominated in currencies other than the canadian dollar 

in fiscal 2019 we plan an increase of approximately 30 stores in canada which would increase selling square footage by approximately 6 

  

tjx international 

 

 net sales for tjx international increased 11 in fiscal 2018 on top of a 3 increase in fiscal 2017 the increase in sales for fiscal 2018 reflected a 7 increase from new stores comp sales growth of 2 and a 2 benefit from the 53 rd week foreign currency translation had a neutral impact on fiscal 2018 sales growth the increase in comp sales for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic ecommerce sales represent less than 3 of tjx international’s net sales 

the increase in fiscal 2017 reflected a 12 increase from new store sales which includes a full fiscal year of tk maxx in australia and a 2 increase from comp sales offset by the unfavorable impact from currency translation of 11 the increase in comp sales for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic 

segment profit margin decreased to 51 for fiscal 2018 compared to 54 for fiscal 2017 the decline in segment margin was driven by higher supply chain costs associated with the opening of a new distribution center and higher store payroll which collectively reduced segment margin by approximately 07 percentage points segment margin was also negatively impacted by expense deleverage on the 2 comp sales growth these declines in segment margin were partially offset by a favorable impact of 04 percentage points due to foreign currency primarily the marktomarket impact of the inventory derivatives as well as the benefit of the 53 rd week which lifted the segment margin by approximately 02 percentage points 

segment profit margin decreased 21 percentage points to 54 in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 the inclusion of tk maxx in australia for the full year negatively impacted segment margin by 09 percentage points in addition fiscal 2017 segment margin was negatively affected by the unfavorable impact of the marktomarket adjustment of inventory derivatives higher store payroll costs and expense deleverage on the lower comp sales growth 

we expect to add approximately 35 stores to tjx international in fiscal 2019 which would increase selling square footage by approximately 5 

general corporate expense 

 

   

general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments general corporate expenses are primarily included in sga expenses the marktomarket adjustment of our fuel hedges is included in cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs 

the increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by the incremental investments related to the 2017 tax act these investments include a discretionary bonus to eligible nonbonus plan associates additional retirement plan contributions and contributions to tjx’s charitable foundations which totaled 100 million in fiscal 2018 

the increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by incremental systems and technology costs as well as increases in compensation benefits and professional services these increases were partially offset by the impact of lower contributions to the tjx charitable foundations in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 

liquidity and capital resources 

our liquidity requirements have traditionally been funded through cash generated from operations supplemented as needed by shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper as of february 3 2018 there were no shortterm bank borrowings or commercial paper outstanding 

we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents internally generated funds and our credit facilities described in note j – long term debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year 

as of february 3 2018 tjx held 28 billion in cash and 05 billion in shortterm investments approximately 18 billion of our cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries with 3986 million held in countries where we provisionally intend to indefinitely reinvest any undistributed earnings tjx has provided for all applicable state and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in canada puerto rico italy india hong kong and vietnam through february 3 2018 if we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries we should not incur additional tax expense and our cash would be reduced by the amount of withholding taxes paid we expect to repatriate more than 1 billion in cash from our subsidiary in canada during fiscal 2019 additionally as part of the 2017 tax act we recorded a transition tax related to the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of 193 million which is payable over 8 years 

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 30 billion in fiscal 2018 36 billion in fiscal 2017 and 30 billion in fiscal 2016 the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2018 decreased by 06 billion compared to fiscal 2017 net income adjusted for noncash items increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 by 03 billion this increase in cash flows was more than offset by a 03 billion decrease in cash flows related to merchandise inventories net of related accounts payable a 03 billion decrease in cash flows related to accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and a 03 billion decrease in cash flows related to accrued expenses and other liabilities merchandise inventories net of related accounts payable increased in fiscal 2018 due in part to the lower inventory levels we carried at fiscal 2017 year end the increase in accounts receivable was driven by credit card receivables the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the prefunding of certain service contracts as well as the timing of rent payments which was impacted by the change in our fiscal year end dates the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities was driven by a reduction in sales taxes and income taxes payable primarily due to timing of payments and benefits associated with the 2017 tax act as well as a contribution of 100 million to the company’s defined benefit pension plan in fiscal 2018 as compared to 50 million last year 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2017 increased by 07 billion compared to fiscal 2016 net income adjusted for noncash items and the early extinguishment of debt increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 by 01 billion the remaining increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to a 03 billion increase in cash flows related to merchandise inventory net of related accounts payable and a 

  

02 billion increase in cash flows related to accrued expenses and other liabilities the positive cash flow impact from the change in inventory net of related accounts payable in 2017 was due to lower inventory levels at fiscal 2017 year end and increased payments in fiscal 2016 due to merchandise received late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 that was paid for in fiscal 2016 the positive impact from accrued expenses and other liabilities was driven primarily by increased liabilities for deferred compensation gift cards and deferred revenue sales taxes and income taxes payable 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below 

 

 we expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 will be approximately 14 billion including approximately 800 million for our offices and distribution centers including buying and merchandising systems and information systems to support growth approximately 400 million for store renovations and approximately 200 million for new stores we plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds 

in fiscal 2018 we purchased 09 billion of investments compared to 07 billion in fiscal 2017 additionally 09 billion of investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2018 compared to 05 billion in the prior year this activity primarily relates to shortterm investments which had initial maturities in excess of 90 days and per our policy are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented 

financing activities net cash used in financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 23 billion in fiscal 2018 16 billion in fiscal 2017 and 22 billion in fiscal 2016 these cash outflows were primarily driven by debt transactions equity repurchases and dividend payments 

debt 

during the fiscal 2017 third quarter we received net proceeds of 9925 million from the issuance of 1 billion of 225 tenyear notes a portion of the proceeds were used to redeem our 375 million 695 notes prior to their scheduled maturity the redemption of the notes including the prepayment penalty resulted in cash outflows of 426 million the remainder of the proceeds from the notes offering were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 

for further information regarding debt see note j – long term debt and credit lines of notes to consolidated financial statements 

equity 

tjx repurchased and retired 223 million shares of its common stock at a cost of 17 billion during fiscal 2018 on a “trade date basis” tjx reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis under our stock repurchase programs we spent 16 billion to repurchase 222 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2018 17 billion to repurchase 223 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2017 and 18 billion to repurchase 266 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2016 

for further information regarding equity repurchases see note d – capital stock and earnings per share of notes to consolidated financial statements 

in february 2018 we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional 30 billion of tjx stock we currently plan to repurchase approximately 25 billion to 30 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2019 we 

  

determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow liquidity economic and market conditions our assessment of prospects for our business legal requirements and other factors the timing and amount of these purchases may change 

dividends 

we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 125 per share in fiscal 2018 104 per share in fiscal 2017 and 084 per share in fiscal 2016 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 764 million in fiscal 2018 651 million in fiscal 2017 and 544 million in fiscal 2016 we also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 134 million in fiscal 2018 164 million in fiscal 2017 and 132 million in fiscal 2016 we expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2019 of 039 per share or an annual dividend of 156 per share subject to the declaration and approval of our board of directors this would represent a 25 increase over the per share dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2018 

contractual obligations as of february 3 2018 we had known contractual obligations under longterm debt arrangements including current installments other longterm obligations operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows in thousands 

 

  

  

  

 we also have longterm liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include 4426 million for employee compensation and benefits and 448 million for uncertain tax positions 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to the areas described below 

inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except tk maxx in australia and stp the businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale ie inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced typically a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns however as a normal business practice we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end historically the variance between estimated shrinkage and 

  

actual shrinkage has not been material to our annual financial results we do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and tradenames we test our longlived assets goodwill and tradenames at least annually for impairment and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets may be impaired significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores as well as of our business units which involve a number of factors including historical trends recent performance and general economic assumptions if we determine that an impairment of longlived assets or tradenames has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets if we determine that an impairment of goodwill has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit over the estimated fair value of the reporting unit but not in excess of the carrying amount of goodwill we determine the fair value of our business units using the discounted cash flow method which requires assumptions for the weighted average cost of capital “wacc” and revenue growth for the related business unit the fair value of our business units exceeds their carrying value by a significant amount with the exception of stp as a result of a reduction in the projected revenue growth rates of stp the estimated fair value of this reporting unit was less than its carrying value and therefore we have recorded an impairment charge of 973 million for the goodwill recorded at the time of acquisition we continue to transition stp from a promotional model to the offprice model and expand its store base although we are optimistic about the future of stp since its acquisition operating results have not met our short term expectations the operating results of stp are not material to tjx’s consolidated results 

retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates we are required to make economic demographic and other assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations the longterm rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets and assumptions about mortality all of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period these assumptions including the discount rate which we determine annually based on market interest rates and our estimated longterm rate of return which can differ considerably from actual returns can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan if our discount rate decreased 025 percentage points our fiscal 2018 pension cost for our funded plan would have increased by approximately 7 million similarly an increase in the discount of rate of 025 percentage points would result in a comparable reduction of pension cost a change of 025 percentage points in our longterm rate of return would increase or decrease our fiscal 2018 pension cost by approximately 3 million when the discount rate market performance of our plan assets changes in laws regulations actuarial standards or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan any required contributions may increase we also consider these factors in determining the amount of voluntary contributions we may make to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements in fiscal 2018 we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of 100 million 

sharebased compensation in accordance with gaap we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan the fair value of the awards is amortized as “sharebased compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service we use the blackscholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results the use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost a 5 increase in expected volatility would increase the peroption value of our most recent option award by 4 while a decrease of the same amount would decrease the peroption value of our most recent option award by 5 

casualty insurance our casualty insurance program is a selfinsured program which requires us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost the estimated claims are developed with the assistance of an actuary based on historical experience and other factors these estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates if our 

  

estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance for fiscal 2018 were to change by 5 the fiscal 2018 pretax cost would increase or decrease by approximately 5 million a large portion of these claims is funded with a nonrefundable payment during the policy year offsetting our estimated claims accrual we had a net accrual of 396 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of february 3 2018 

reserves for uncertain tax positions like many large corporations our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation assessment examination litigation and settlement the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain in accordance with gaap we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the positions we have taken will not be sustained however in the next twelve months and in future periods the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay as the result of the final resolutions of examinations judicial or administrative proceedings changes in facts law or legal interpretations expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of or changes in tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made such as the recently enacted tax reform finally foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 tax act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

the 2017 tax act significantly changes how corporations are taxed requiring complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in us tax law significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions and significant estimates in calculations and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced the us treasury department the irs and other standardsetting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 tax act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation as we complete our analysis of the 2017 tax act collect and prepare necessary data and interpret any additional guidance we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made 

loss contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our management with the assistance of our legal counsel assesses such contingent liabilities such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the us dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations our currency risk primarily relates to our activity in the canadian dollar british pound and euro as more fully described in note e financial instruments of notes to consolidated financial statements we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments primarily at our international operations and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international operations we enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries our foreign exchange risk management policy prohibits us from using derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use any leveraged derivative financial instruments we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency as of february 3 2018 and january 28 2017 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pretax income by approximately 78 million and 65 million in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 respectively 

equity price and other market risk 

the assets of our funded qualified pension plan a portion of which are equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets we invest the pension assets described further in note i pension plans and other retirement benefits of notes to consolidated financial statements in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties investments in general are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility risks a significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan resulting in increased required contributions to the plan or other planrelated liabilities our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes

flexible business model our flexible offprice business model including our opportunistic buying inventory management logistics and flexible store layouts is designed to deliver our customers a compelling value proposition of quality fashionable brand name and designer merchandise at excellent values every day our buying and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than traditional retailers and the design and operation of our stores and distribution centers support this flexibility our merchants have more visibility into consumer fashion and market trends and pricing when we buy closer to need which can help us “buy smarter” and reduce our markdown exposure our selling floor space is flexible without walls between departments and largely free of permanent fixtures so we can easily expand and contract departments to accommodate the merchandise we purchase our logistics and distribution operations are designed to support our buying strategies and to facilitate quick efficient and differentiated delivery of merchandise to our stores with a goal of getting the right merchandise to the right stores at the right time 

opportunistic buying as an offprice retailer our buying practices which we refer to as opportunistic buying differentiate us from traditional retailers our overall buying strategy is to acquire merchandise on an ongoing basis that will enable us to offer a desirable and rapidly changing mix of branded designer and other quality merchandise in our stores at prices below regular prices for comparable merchandise at department and specialty stores we seek out and select merchandise from the broad range of opportunities in the marketplace to achieve this end our buying organization which numbers more than 1000 associates in 15 buying offices in 11 countries executes this opportunistic buying strategy in a variety of ways depending on market conditions and other factors 

we take advantage of opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from the production and flow of inventory in the apparel and home fashions marketplace these opportunities include among others order cancellations manufacturer overruns closeouts and special production direct from brands and factories our buying strategies are intentionally flexible to allow us to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market and to adjust how and what we source as well as when we source it our goal is to operate with lean inventory levels compared to conventional retailers to give us the flexibility to seek out and to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise in contrast to traditional retailers which tend to order most of their goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor our merchants generally remain in the marketplace throughout the year frequently looking for opportunities to buy merchandise we buy much of our merchandise for the current or immediately upcoming selling season we also buy some merchandise that is available in the market with the intention of storing it for sale typically in future selling seasons we generally make these purchases referred to as packaway in response to opportunities in the marketplace to buy merchandise that we believe has the right combination of brand fashion price and quality to supplement the product we expect to be available to purchase later for those future seasons we also 

  

acquire some merchandise that we offer under inhouse brands or brands that are licensed to us we develop some of this merchandise ourselves in order to supplement the depth of or fill gaps in our expected merchandise assortment 

our expansive vendor universe which is in excess of 18000 consists primarily of manufacturers along with retailers and other vendors and provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quality merchandise for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments and expect this will continue as we continue to grow we believe a number of factors provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise and make us an attractive channel for many vendors in the market we are typically willing to purchase lessthanfull assortments of items styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large we are able to disperse merchandise across our geographically diverse network of stores and to target specific markets we pay promptly we generally do not ask for typical retail concessions such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries or return privileges and we have financial strength and an excellent credit rating 

inventory management we offer our customers a rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a treasure hunt experience in our stores and to spur frequent customer visits to achieve this we seek to turn the inventory in our stores rapidly regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions at excellent values our specialized inventory planning purchasing monitoring and markdown systems coupled with distribution center storage processing handling and shipping systems enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local preferences and demographics achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of products and generally sell within the period we planned we make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations centrally using information provided by specialized computer systems designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner we continue to invest in our supply chain with the goal of continuing to operate with low inventory levels to ship more efficiently and quickly and to more precisely and effectively allocate merchandise to each store 

pricing our mission is to offer quality fashionable brand name and designer merchandise in our stores with retail prices that are generally 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular retail prices on comparable merchandise every day we do not generally engage in promotional pricing activity such as sales or coupons we have generally been able to react to price fluctuations in the wholesale market to maintain our pricing gap relative to prices offered by traditional retailers as well as our merchandise margins through various economic cycles 

low cost operations we operate with a low cost structure compared to many traditional retailers we focus aggressively on expenses throughout our business our advertising is generally focused on promoting our retail banners rather than individual products including at times promoting multiple banners together which contributes to our advertising budget as a percentage of sales remaining low compared to many traditional retailers we design our stores to provide a pleasant convenient shopping environment but relative to other retailers do not spend heavily on store fixtures additionally our distribution network is designed to run cost effectively 

customer serviceshopping experience we continue to renovate and upgrade our stores across our retail banners to enhance our customers’ shopping experience and help drive sales although we offer a selfservice format we train our store associates to provide friendly and helpful customer service and seek to staff our stores to deliver a positive shopping experience we typically offer customerfriendly return policies we accept a variety of payment methods including cash credit cards and debit cards we also offer tjxbranded credit cards in the us through a bank but do not own the customer receivables

 item 1a risk factors tableend the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks that follow are those that we think individually or in the aggregate could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements 

failure to execute our opportunistic buying strategy and inventory management could adversely affect our results 

while opportunistic buying operating with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are key elements of our offprice business strategy they subject us to risks related to the pricing quantity mix nature and timing of inventory flowing to our stores our merchants are in the marketplace frequently as much of our merchandise is purchased for the current or immediately upcoming season and our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion with them our business model expects them to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market assess the desirability and value of merchandise and generally make determinations of how and what we source as well as when we source it if we do not obtain the right merchandise at the right times in the right quantities at the right prices and in the right mix our customer traffic as well as our sales and margins could be adversely affected 

we base our purchases of inventory in part on our sales forecasts if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory leading to decreased profit margins or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales either of which could adversely affect our financial performance 

if we are unable to generally purchase inventory at prices sufficiently below prices paid by conventional retailers we may not be able to maintain an overall pricing differential to regular department and specialty stores and our ability to attract customers or sustain our margins may be adversely affected we may not achieve this pricing differential at various times or in some segments chains or geographies which could adversely affect our results 

similarly we must also properly execute our inventory management strategy of distributing the right product to the right stores in the right quantities at the right time to respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns we need to appropriately allocate and deliver merchandise to our stores maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store and appropriately change the allocation of floor space at our stores among product categories if we are not able to do so our ability to attract and retain customers and our results could be adversely affected 

failure to continue to expand our business and operations successfully or to manage our substantial size and scale effectively could adversely affect our financial results 

our growth strategy includes successfully expanding our offprice model within our current markets and into new geographic regions product lines businesses and channels and as appropriate adding new businesses whether by development investment or acquisition there are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand successfully including managing the implementation of this growth effectively if any aspect of our expansion strategy does not achieve the success we expect in whole or in part we may fail to meet our financial performance expectations be required to increase our investment slow our planned growth or close stores or operations for example successful store growth requires us to find and lease appropriate real estate on attractive terms in each of the locations where we seek to open stores the success of this process depends on many factors including availability of appropriate sites real estate construction and development costs costs and availability of capital and zoning or other land use regulations if we cannot lease appropriate sites on attractive terms it could limit our ability to successfully grow in various markets or adversely affect the economics of new stores in various markets similarly new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit 

  

levels as our existing stores whether in current or new markets or adding stores or banners to existing markets may otherwise adversely affect our sales and profitability 

further our substantial size imposes demands on effectively managing our complex operations and maintaining appropriate internal resources and third party providers to support our business effectively these demands may increase as we grow our business adding pressure to management and various functions across our business including administration systems merchandising store operations distribution and compliance and on appropriately staffing and training associates in these areas as we grow the large size and scale of our operations our multiple banners and locations in the us canada europe and australia and the autonomy afforded to the banners in some aspects of the business increase the risk that our systems controls practices and policies will not be implemented effectively or consistently throughout our company and that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations these risks may increase as we continue to grow particularly as we expand into additional countries if business information is not shared effectively or if we are otherwise unable to manage our size or growth effectively we may operate with decreased operational efficiency may need to reduce our rate of expansion of one or more operations or otherwise curtail growth in one or more markets which may adversely affect our success in executing our business goals and adversely impact our sales and results 

failure to identify consumer trends and preferences to meet customer demand in new or existing markets or channels could negatively impact our performance 

as our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand we work to identify consumer trends and preferences on an ongoing basis and to offer inventory that meets those trends and preferences however doing so on a timely basis across our diverse merchandise categories and in the many markets in the us canada europe and australia in which we do business is challenging trends and preferences in new markets may differ from what we anticipate although our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer preferences and trends and to expand and contract merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes we may not successfully do so which could add difficulty in attracting new customers retaining existing customers encouraging frequent visits and adversely affect our results 

customers may also have expectations about how they shop in stores or through ecommerce or more generally engage with businesses across different channels through internetbased and other digital or mobile channels or particular forms of social media outlets which may vary across demographics and may evolve rapidly meeting these expectations effectively involves identifying the right opportunities and making the right investments at the right time and with the right speed among other things and failure to do so may impact our reputation and our financial results 

if we fail to successfully implement our various marketing efforts or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise may be influenced by our marketing efforts the name recognition and reputation of our banners and the location of and service offered in our stores although we use marketing to drive customer traffic through various media including television radio print outdoor digitalsocial media email mobile and direct mail some of our competitors expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage further we may not effectively implement strategies with respect to rapidly evolving internetbased and other digital or mobile communication channels and other social media our programs may not be or remain effective or could require increased expenditures which could have a significant adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the retail apparel and home fashion businesses are highly competitive we compete with local regional national and international retailers that sell apparel home fashions and other merchandise we sell including in stores through ecommerce catalogues or other media or channels some of our competitors are larger than we are or have more experience in selling certain product lines than we do new competitors frequently enter the 

  

market and existing competitors enter or increase their presence in the markets in which we operate expand their merchandise offerings add new sales channels or change their pricing strategies all of which affect the competitive landscape we compete on the basis of value meaning a combination of brand fashion price and quality merchandise selection and freshness banner name recognition and appeal customer service reputation and store location if we fail to compete effectively our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 

failure to employ quality associates in appropriate numbers including key associates and management could adversely affect our performance 

our performance depends on recruiting hiring developing training and retaining talented associates in key areas such as buying and management as well as quality store systems distribution center and other associates in large numbers a significant number of our associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover availability and skill of associates may differ across markets in which we do business and in new markets we enter and we may be unable to manage our labor needs effectively in addition because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must provide significant internal training and development for key associates across the company including within our buying organization similar to other retailers we face challenges in securing and retaining sufficient talent in management and other key areas for many reasons including competition in the retail industry and for talent in various geographic markets if we do not effectively attract qualified individuals train them in our business model support their development and retain them our growth could be limited and our performance could be adversely affected 

labor costs including pension and healthcare costs and other challenges from our large workforce may adversely affect our results and profitability 

we have a large workforce and our ability to meet our labor needs and control labor costs is subject to various factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates and wage requirements participant benefit levels changing demographics economic conditions interest rate changes economic demographic and other actuarial assumptions health and other insurance costs and a dynamic regulatory environment including health care legislation immigration law and governmental labor and employment and employee benefits programs and requirements each of which could increase our costs increased labor costs including costs of providing and managing retirement health and other employment benefits may adversely affect our results of operations in addition when wage rates or benefit levels increase in a market increasing our wages or benefits may negatively impact our earnings as they did during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 while failing to increase our wages or benefits competitively or reducing our wages or benefits could result in a decline in our ability to attract or retain associates or in the quality of our workforce causing our customer service or performance to suffer which could impact our results many associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions of various kinds as well as risks and potential material expenses associated with multiemployer plans including from plan underfunding benefit cuts withdrawal liability or insolvency of other participating employers or governmental insurance programs other associates are members of works councils which may subject us to additional actions or expense 

compromises of our data security could materially harm our reputation and business 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect store process and transmit certain information from individuals such as our customers and associates including for example customer payment card and check information we rely in part on commercially available systems software hardware services tools and monitoring to provide security for collection storage processing and transmission of personal andor confidential information as with many other companies particularly in the retail industry we are subject to attempts to compromise our data security computer hackers may for example attempt to penetrate our computer systems or those of the third parties with whom we work or to whom we outsource business operations and if successful misappropriate customer or associate information or confidential business information of our company while we have taken steps designed to further strengthen the security of our computer systems since the unauthorized intrusions into our network discovered late in 2006 in which we believe customer data were stolen there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a future data security 

  

compromise that unauthorized parties will not gain access to the information that we collect store process or transmit or otherwise interfere with our systems or that any such data security compromise or unauthorized access will be discovered in a timely way in addition an associate contractor or third parties with whom we work or to whom we outsource business operations may fail to monitor their or our systems effectively may fail to maintain appropriate safeguards may misuse the personal or confidential information to which they have access may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to access or misappropriate such types of information or may purposefully or through error inadvertently cause a breach involving or otherwise disclose such information advances in computer and software technology and capabilities rapid changes in the sources methods and targets of cyberattacks and other developments including the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals generally may increase the risk of such a breach 

compromise of our data security or that of third parties with whom we work or to whom we outsource business operations including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods or error failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business information and delays in detecting any such compromise or loss could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and decrease our customers’ willingness to shop in our stores or online impact our ability to attract and retain customers violate applicable laws regulations orders and agreements and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material 

failure to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information systems including data centers telecommunications systems hardware and software and applications to manage many aspects of our business including to process and record transactions in our stores to enable effective communication systems to source plan and track inventory to manage logistics to generate performance and financial reports to comply with regulatory requirements and to operate our ecommerce sites we are dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems supporting these internal and external systems requires a number of resources including effective and qualified and in some cases specialized teams as we grow and as our systems evolve we must continue to hire train manage and retain these teams including those needed to support our customized and legacy systems in an effective way our information systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are also subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes including power outages system failures computer viruses or malware security breaches cyberattacks catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and design or usage errors by our associates contractors or third party service providers on which we rely although we seek to maintain our systems effectively manage our team of internal and third party resources effectively and successfully address the risk of compromises of the integrity security and consistent operations of our systems we may not be successful in doing so our approach to disaster recovery may not be adequate and any compromises interruptions or shutdowns of our systems including those managed by third parties whether intentional or inadvertent could lead to delays in our business operations and if significant or extreme affect our results of operations in addition any interruption in the operation of our websites particularly our ecommerce sites could cause us to suffer reputational harm or to lose sales if customers are unable to access our site or purchase merchandise from us during such an interruption 

we modify update and replace our systems and infrastructure from time to time including by adding new hardware software and applications maintaining updating or replacing legacy programs converting to global systems integrating new service providers and adding enhanced or new functionality such as for cloud computing technologies and for the continued operation and development of our ecommerce businesses and adding or integrating with new systems when we acquire new businesses we also modify and change our procedures for and add and change vendors and internal teams who assist us with designing implementing and maintaining our systems although we believe we are diligent in selecting systems teams and vendors and implementing procedures to enable us to maintain the integrity of our systems when we implement modify or replace them there are inherent risks associated with implementing modifying or replacing systems with new or changed relationships and with changes from and integrations with acquisitions including accurately capturing and maintaining data efficiently testing and implementing changes in a timely manner realizing the expected 

  

benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption of the operation of the systems and diversion of internal teams’ attention as the changes are implemented further potential issues associated with implementing technology initiatives and the time and resources required in seeking to optimize the benefits of new elements of our systems and its infrastructure could reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term overall the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends upon our information systems including our ability to operate maintain and develop them effectively and a failure of those systems could disrupt our business subject us to liability or otherwise impact our financial results 

economic conditions on a global level or in particular markets may adversely affect our financial performance 

global financial markets can experience volatility disruption and credit contraction which could adversely affect global economic conditions turmoil in the financial and credit markets or other changes in economic conditions could adversely affect sources of liquidity available to us or our costs of capital and could adversely affect plan asset values and investment performance and increase our pension liabilities expenses and funding requirements and other related financial exposure with respect to companysponsored and multiemployer pension plans economic conditions both on a global level and in particular markets including unemployment decreased disposable income and actual and perceived wealth energy and health care costs costs of oil gas and other commodities interest and tax rates and policies weakness in the housing market volatility in capital markets decreased credit availability inflation and deflation as well as political or other factors beyond our control such as threats or possibilities of war terrorism global or national unrest actual or threatened epidemics and political instability may also have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending that would in turn affect retail sales these conditions and factors could adversely affect discretionary consumer spending and although we believe our flexible offprice model helps us react they may adversely affect our sales cash flows and results of operations and performance 

adverse or unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate or along our supply chain could adversely affect our operating results 

both adverse and unseasonable weather such as storms severe cold or heat or unseasonable temperatures even if not extreme may affect customers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop certain categories or at all and accordingly can adversely affect the demand for the merchandise in our stores particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise weather can also affect the ability to transport merchandise to our stores from our vendors distribution and shipping centers or elsewhere in our supply chain efficiently or in a timely way as a result adverse or unseasonable weather could adversely affect our sales increase markdowns and adversely affect our operating results 

as our business is subject to seasonal influences a decrease in sales or margins a severe disruption or other significant event that impacts our business during the second half of the year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operating results 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we generally realize higher levels of sales and earnings in the second half of the year which includes the backtoschool and yearend holiday seasons any decrease in sales or margins or any significant adverse event during this period could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations 

our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic events 

unforeseen public health issues such as pandemics and epidemics natural or other disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other extreme weather and climate conditions or fires explosions and acts of war or terrorism could disrupt our operations or the operations of one or more of our vendors or of our supply chain or could severely damage or destroy one or more of our stores or distribution facilities located in the affected areas daytoday operations including our ability to receive products from our vendors or transport products to our stores could be adversely affected or we could be required to close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by affected distribution centers for a short or extended period of time as a result our business could be adversely affected 

  

damage to our corporate reputation or those of our retail banners could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

we believe that building the brand reputation of our company and our retail banners is important to our continuing success in the many different markets in which we do business we work to build relationships with our customers through our various marketing campaigns and other activities these relationships and our reputation are based in part on perceptions of subjective qualities so incidents involving us our employees our policies the merchandise that we carry or our industry more generally that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business particularly if the incidents result in rapid or significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry information about us our retail banners our employees our policies and the merchandise we sell including our licensed or owned brands publicized through traditional or digital media platforms and similar venues including blogs websites and other forums for rapid broad communications to an audience of consumers and other interested persons may adversely affect our reputation and brand even if the information is inaccurate incomplete or unverified the reputation of our company and our retail banners may be damaged by adverse events at the corporate level or at our retail banners or by an associate acting outside of company policies in all one or some of the markets in which we do business similarly challenges or reactions to action or inaction or perceived action or inaction by our company on issues like compliance related to social product labor and environmental standards or other sensitive topics could harm our reputation damage to the reputation of our company and our banners could result in declines in customer loyalty and sales affect our vendor relationships business development opportunities and associate retention divert attention and resources from management including to respond to inquiries or additional regulatory scrutiny and otherwise adversely affect our results 

quality safety or other issues with merchandise we sell could damage our reputation sales and financial results 

various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we sell to consumers regulations and standards in this area including those related to the us consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 state regulations like california’s proposition 65 and similar legislation in other countries in which we operate impose restrictions and requirements on the merchandise we sell in our stores and through ecommerce these regulations change from time to time and new federal state provincial or local regulations in the us and other countries that may affect our business are contemplated and enacted with some regularity if we or our merchandise vendors are unable to comply with regulatory requirements on a timely basis or at all or to adequately monitor new regulations that may apply to existing or new merchandise categories or in new geographies significant fines or penalties could be incurred or we could have to curtail some aspects of our sales or operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results we rely on our vendors to provide quality merchandise that complies with applicable product safety laws and other applicable laws but they may not comply with their obligations to do so although our arrangements with our vendors frequently provide for indemnification for product liabilities the vendors may fail to honor those obligations to an extent we consider sufficient or at all customer concerns or issues with the quality and safety of merchandise particularly with products subject to increased levels of regulation or the genuineness of merchandise regardless of whether verified or our fault could cause damage to our reputation and could result in lost sales uninsured claims or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs and regulatory civil or criminal fines or penalties any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

failure to comply with existing laws regulations and orders or changes in existing laws regulations and applicable accounting principles and interpretations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

we are subject to federal state provincial regional and local laws rules and regulations in various countries in which we operate any of which may change from time to time as well as orders and assurances these legal regulatory and administrative requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business from the cost of providing health care and retirement benefits workforce management logistics marketing importexport sourcing and manufacturing tax data protection and others if we or third parties that perform services on our 

  

behalf fail to comply with these laws rules regulations and orders we may be subject to judgments fines or other costs or penalties which could materially adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition 

complying with applicable laws rules and regulations and our own internal policies may also require us to spend additional time and resources to implement new procedures and financial and other controls conduct audits train associates and third parties on our compliance methods or take other actions particularly as we continue to grow globally and enter new markets or countries any of which could adversely impact our results 

we must also comply with new and changing laws and regulations new regulatory initiatives evolving interpretation of existing laws by judicial and regulatory authorities and reforms in jurisdictions where we do business these changes could increase our costs of compliance or of doing business and could adversely affect our operating results including such changes involving 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 particularly in a dynamic regulatory environment anticipated changes to laws and regulations may require us to invest in compliance efforts before changes are certain 

further applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time and the changes could have material effects on our future or previously reported financial results 

our expanding international operations expose us to risks inherent in operating in new countries 

we have a significant retail presence in canada and in countries in europe and have established buying offices around the world we have expanded our operations into additional countries in europe and into australia and our goal is to continue to expand our operations into other countries in the future it can be costly and complex to establish develop and maintain international operations and promote business in new international jurisdictions which may differ significantly from other countries in which we currently operate in addition to facing risks similar to our us and current international operations such as with regulations like the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act there are additional risks inherent in opening and developing operations in new countries these additional risks include among others understanding the local retail climate and trends local customs and cultures seasonal differences business practices and competitive conditions complying with relevant laws rules and regulations developing the appropriate infrastructure identifying suitable partners for local operations and for integration with our global operations and effectively communicating and implementing company policies and practices in new possibly remote jurisdictions there are also financial regulatory and other risks associated with international operations including currency exchange fluctuations potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds outside of the country where earned trade regulations the risk of sudden policy or regulatory changes the risk of political economic and civil instability and labor unrest and uncertainties regarding interpretation application and enforceability of laws and agreements any of these risks could adversely impact our operations profitability or liquidity 

we are subject to risks associated with sourcing merchandise from other countries and moving merchandise internationally 

many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a lesser extent by us in many countries outside of the country where the stores are located particularly southeastern asia where we are the 

  

importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements including those similar to requirements imposed upon the manufacturer of such products we are subject to the various risks of sourcing merchandise from other countries including moving merchandise internationally such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these and other factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise beyond our control could affect the availability and the price of our inventory and our operating costs furthermore although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to international operations and importing merchandise there can be no assurance that our associates and our contractors agents vendors or other third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our reputation operations or operating results 

our results may be adversely affected by reduced availability or increases in the price of oil or other fuels raw materials and other commodities or other increases in utility transportation or logistics costs 

energy and fuel costs can fluctuate dramatically and at times have resulted in significant cost increases particularly for the price of oil and gasoline an increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers although we typically enter into derivative instruments designed to manage a portion of our transportation costs a hedging strategy any such strategy may not be effective or sufficient and could result in increased operating costs increased regulation related to environmental costs including cap and trade carbon taxes or other emissions management systems could also adversely affect our costs of doing business including utility transportation and logistics costs similarly other commodity prices can fluctuate dramatically such as the cost of cotton and synthetic fabrics which at times have risen significantly such increases can increase the cost of merchandise which could adversely affect our performance through potentially reduced consumer demand or reduced margins 

  

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and changes in currency exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into us dollars for financial reporting purposes because of this movements in currency exchange rates have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our consolidated and segment results from time to time changes in currency exchange rates can also increase the cost of inventory purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the business buying the merchandise when exchange rates change significantly in a short period or move unfavorably over an extended period as in recent years it can be difficult for us to adjust retail prices accordingly and gross margin can be adversely affected in addition a significant amount of merchandise we offer for sale is made in china and accordingly a revaluation of chinese currency or increased market flexibility in the exchange rate for that currency increasing its value relative to the us dollar or currencies in which our stores are located could be significant 

additionally we routinely enter into inventoryrelated derivative instruments a hedging strategy to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rates on merchandise margins of merchandise purchases by our segments denominated in currencies other than their local currencies in accordance with gaap we evaluate the fair value of these derivative instruments and make marktomarket adjustments at the end of each accounting period these adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our earnings 

although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates we expect that currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations from time to time in addition fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our earnings and operating results if a counterparty to one of our hedging arrangements fails to perform 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate and may fall short of prior periods our projections or the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past and they may do so in the future if we fail to increase our results over prior periods to achieve our projected results or to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price may decline and the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance results may be affected by various factors including those described in these risk factors we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to project sales and align expenses if we do not control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results or if actual results differ significantly from our forecast our financial performance could be adversely affected in addition if we do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplated pursuant to our stock repurchase programs our earnings per share may be adversely affected 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions or investments in new businesses or divest close or consolidate any of our current businesses our business will be subject to additional risks 

we may acquire new businesses as we did with trade secret in fiscal 2016 and stp in fiscal 2013 invest in or enter into joint ventures with other businesses develop new businesses internally as with our new home store concept and divest close or consolidate businesses failure to execute on mergers acquisitions investments divestitures closings and consolidations in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition acquisition investment or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses and we may not effectively evaluate target companies investments or investment partners or assess the risks benefits and cost of buying investing in or closing businesses or of the integration of acquired businesses all of which can be difficult timeconsuming and dilutive these activities may not meet our performance and other expectations and may expose us to unexpected or greaterthanexpected costs liabilities and risks in addition we have recorded intangible assets and goodwill and the value of the tradenames in connection with our acquisitions of trade secret and stp and 

  

may similarly do so in the future in connection with other acquisitions if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions we may be required to impair some or all of the goodwill associated with an acquisition which could adversely impact our results of operations and balance sheet divestitures closings and consolidations could involve risks such as significant costs and obligations of closure including exposure on leases owned real estate and other contractual employment pension and severance obligations and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer 

our results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation legal proceedings and other legal or regulatory matters 

we are involved or may in the future become involved in legal proceedings regulatory reviews audits and other legal matters these may involve inquiries investigations lawsuits and other proceedings by local provincial state and federal governmental entities in the united states and other countries and private plaintiffs including with respect to employment and employee benefits including classification employment rights discrimination wage and hour and retaliation whistle blower claims tax securities disclosure real estate tort business practices consumer protection privacydata security product safety and compliance advertising and intellectual property there continue to be a number of employmentrelated and consumer protection lawsuits including putative class actions in the united states and we are subject to these types of suits we cannot predict the results of legal and regulatory proceedings with certainty and actual results may differ from any reserves we establish estimating the probable outcome regardless of merit or outcome litigation can be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expense and diversion of management attention legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations could expose us to significant defense costs fines penalties and liability to private parties and governmental entities for monetary recoveries and other amounts and attorneys’ fees andor require us to change aspects of our operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income and other taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including the results of tax audits and examinations income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory income tax rates changes in income tax rates changes in transfer pricing changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in applicable tax legislation regulations and treaties exposure to additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision and accruals for taxes and actual results may differ from our estimations 

in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state provincial and local tax authorities in the us and foreign countries and the examining authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various proceedings which are at various stages with such authorities with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these proceedings to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of our provision for income taxes and increase and decrease our provision as a result of these assessments however the developments in and actual results of proceedings or the result of rulings by or settlements with tax authorities and courts or due to changes in facts law or legal interpretations expiration of applicable statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions could differ from the amounts we have accrued for such proceedings in either a positive or a negative manner which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations in addition we are subject to tax audits and examinations for payroll value added salesbased and other taxes relating to our businesses 

  

our real estate leases generally obligate us for long periods which subjects us to financial risks 

we lease virtually all of our store locations generally for an initial term of 10 years with options to renew the term in the us and canada or an initial term of 10 to 15 years in europe in addition we either own or lease for long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices accordingly we are subject to the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate which can adversely affect our results while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions including by making specified payments we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so if we decide to close stores we are generally required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases which generally include among other things paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or paying to exercise rights to terminate and the performance of any of these obligations may be expensive when we assign leases or sublease space to third parties or if we sell a business we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform as was the case with some of our former operations in addition when the lease term for the stores in our ongoing operations expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close stores or to relocate stores within a market on less favorable terms 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our operations growth stock repurchases and dividends and interest and debt repayment 

our business depends upon our operations to continue to generate strong cash flow to supply capital to support our general operating activities to fund our growth and our return of cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase programs and dividends and to pay our interest and debt repayments our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or to repatriate cash from our international operations in a manner that is cost effective could adversely affect our growth plans and financial performance including our earnings per share we borrow on occasion to finance our activities and if financing were not available to us in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed it could also adversely affect our financial performance

fiscal 2017 was another successful year for tjx we posted a strong increase in net sales and solid earnings per share growth on top of strong increases in both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 we continued to generate strong cash flows allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases in addition we continue to reinvest in our business by adding new stores and remodeling existing ones while continuing to strengthen our infrastructure in support of our continuing growth and we implemented the second phase of our wage initiative to raise wages for us hourly store associates 

highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2017 include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results followed by a discussion of our segment operating results 

net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal 2017 totaled 332 billion a 7 increase over 309 billion in fiscal 2016 the increase reflected a 5 increase from same store sales and a 4 increase from new stores 

  

offset by a 2 negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates net sales from our ecommerce businesses amount to approximately 1 of total sales and had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2017 sales growth consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016 totaled 309 billion a 6 increase over 291 billion in fiscal 2015 the increase reflected a 5 increase from same store sales and a 4 increase from new stores offset by a 3 negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates 

same store sales increases in the us for fiscal 2017 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic we also had a strong increase in units sold which was largely offset by a reduction in the average ticket in fiscal 2017 home fashions performed better than apparel but both recorded strong same store sales growth geographically in the us sales were strong in virtually all regions with the southeast and the great lakes regions reporting the highest same store sales growth in canada same store sales increases were well above the consolidated average while tjx international was below the consolidated average 

same store sales increases in the us for fiscal 2016 were due to an increase in customer traffic we also had a strong increase in units sold which was offset by a reduction in the average ticket in fiscal 2016 home fashions performed better than apparel but both recorded strong same store sales growth geographically in the us sales were strong in virtually all regions with the southeast reporting the highest same store sales growth in canada same store sales increases were well above the consolidated average while tjx international was slightly below the consolidated average 

we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation the sales of our ecommerce businesses meaning sierra trading post including stores tjmaxxcom and tkmaxxcom are not included in same store sales we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria the recently acquired trade secret stores will be included in same store sales when they meet the above definition we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated by translating the current year’s same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance we define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the same store sales calculation and define average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold we define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the same store sales calculation 

the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales 

 

  

   

impact of foreign currency exchange rates  our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows 

 

  

 we refer to the impact of the above two items throughout our discussion as “foreign currency” this does not include the impact currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division’s local currency when discussing the impact on our results of the effect of currency exchange rates on such transactions we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange” 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 710 in fiscal 2017 compared to 712 in fiscal 2016 and 715 in fiscal 2015 the improvement in this expense ratio was driven by an increase in our profit margin on merchandise sold merchandise margin along with leverage on buying and occupancy costs as a result of the 5 same store sales increase together these two items benefitted the fiscal 2017 expense ratio by approximately 05 percentage points merchandise margin improved despite the continued pressure transactional foreign exchange had on the cost of merchandise at our foreign segments this year versus the prior year although not as significant as in fiscal 2016 the change in exchange rates continued to impact the cost of merchandise that was denominated in currencies other than our foreign segments’ local currency primarily the us dollar these improvements were partially offset by higher supply chain costs and the negative impact of the mark to market of inventory derivatives 

the improvement in the fiscal 2016 expense ratio as compared to fiscal 2015 was driven by leverage on buying and occupancy costs as a result of the 5 same store sales increase along with an increase in merchandise margin similar to fiscal 2017 together these two items benefitted the fiscal 2016 expense ratio by approximately 05 percentage points merchandise margin improved despite the negative impact transactional foreign exchange had on the cost of merchandise for tjx canada and europe for fiscal 2016 versus fiscal 2015 the change in exchange rates increased the cost of merchandise purchased by tjx canada and europe that were denominated in currencies other than the divisions’ respective local currency primarily the us dollar this expense ratio was also negatively impacted by increased freight and distribution costs associated with moving more units through our supply chain and the mark to market of inventory derivatives 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 174 in fiscal 2017 168 in fiscal 2016 and 161 in fiscal 2015 the increase in this ratio in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a combination of higher employee payroll costs due to wage 

  

increases investments to support our growth and supply chain costs partially offset by the favorable impact of reduced contributions to the tjx charitable foundations in fiscal 2017 

similar to fiscal 2017 the increase in this ratio in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a combination of higher employee payroll costs due to our wage initiative and an increase in supply chain costs along with our incremental investments in addition the fiscal 2016 expense ratio was unfavorably impacted by higher contributions to tjx’s charitable foundations in fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year 

loss on early extinguishment of debt on september 12 2016 we issued 10 billion of 225 ten year notes we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem our 375 million 695 notes on october 12 2016 prior to their scheduled maturity of april 15 2019 we recorded a pretax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of 518 million 

pension settlement charge during the fiscal 2017 third quarter we offered eligible former tjx associates who had not yet commenced receiving their qualified pension plan benefit an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit on october 21 2016 tjx’s qualified pension plan paid 1032 million from pension plan assets to those who accepted this offer this transaction had no cash impact on tjx but did result in a noncash pretax settlement charge of 312 million 

interest expense net the components of interest expense net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

 

 the decrease in net interest expense for fiscal 2017 is due to additional interest income as a result of an increase in investments as well as an increase in interest rates 

the increase in net interest expense for fiscal 2016 reflects interest expense in fiscal 2016 on the financing lease obligation related to tjx canada’s new home office of 37 million the increase in net interest expense also reflects a reduction in capitalized interest costs and interest income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 

income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was 383 in fiscal 2017 377 in fiscal 2016 and 376 in fiscal 2015 the increase in the fiscal 2017 income tax rate was due to the jurisdictional mix of income and the valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses in addition the fiscal 2016 effective income tax rates benefitted from a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions related to our adoption of the new tangible property regulations the increase in the fiscal 2016 effective income tax rate as compared to fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of income and the valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses 

net income and diluted earnings per share net income was 23 billion in fiscal 2017 a 1 increase over 23 billion in fiscal 2016 which in turn was a 3 increase over 22 billion in fiscal 2015 diluted earnings per share were 346 in fiscal 2017 333 in fiscal 2016 and 315 in fiscal 2015 the third quarter charges from the loss on early extinguishment of debt and the pension settlement collectively reduced fiscal 2017 net income by 500 million or 007 per share foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results foreign currency exchange rates had a 007 negative impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016 and a 009 negative impact in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015 

our stock repurchase programs which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding benefited our earnings per share growth by approximately 3 in each fiscal year we repurchased 223 million shares of our stock at a cost of 17 billion in fiscal 2017 265 million shares of our stock at a cost of 18 billion in fiscal 2016 and 277 million shares of our stock at a cost of 17 billion in fiscal 2015 

  

segment information we operate four main business segments our marmaxx tj maxx marshalls and tjmaxxcom and homegoods segments both operate in the united states our tjx canada segment operates winners homesense and marshalls in canada and our tjx international segment operates tk maxx homesense and tkmaxxcom in europe and trade secret in australia in the us we also operate stp an offprice internet retailer with a small number of stores we currently consider all of stp including its limited number of stores as part of our ecommerce businesses the results of stp have been included in our marmaxx segment we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income or loss before general corporate expense loss on early extinguishment of debt the pension settlement charge and interest expense “segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities the terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales these measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 

presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments 

us segments 

marmaxx 

 

 net sales at marmaxx increased 7 in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 the increase reflected a 5 increase from same store sales and a 2 increase from new store sales the same store sales increase of 5 in fiscal 2017 is on top of a 4 increase in the prior year same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2017 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic marmaxx same store sales also reflect an increase in units sold which was largely offset by a decrease in the average ticket geographically same store sales were strong throughout most of the country with the southeast and great lakes regions particularly strong home fashions outperformed apparel for fiscal 2017 with both categories posting same store sales growth overall ecommerce sales represent approximately 2 of marmaxx’s net sales 

the same store sales increase of 4 in fiscal 2016 was on top of a 1 increase in the prior year same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2016 was due to an increase in customer traffic marmaxx same store sales also reflect an increase in units sold which was more than offset by a decrease in the average ticket our merchandise mix and pricing strategy throughout fiscal 2016 resulted in the lower average ticket which we believe contributed to strong growth in customer traffic and in units sold geographically same store sales were strong throughout most of the country with the southeast region particularly strong home fashions outperformed apparel for fiscal 2016 with both categories posting same store sales growth 

segment margin in fiscal 2017 was 141 compared to 143 in fiscal 2016 marmaxx results for fiscal 2017 reflect an increase in merchandise margin and buying and occupancy expense leverage on same store 

  

sales growth of approximately 07 percentage points however these gains were more than offset by higher store payroll costs primarily due to wage increases and processing more units at the store level higher distribution costs as well as an increase in credit card chargeback costs tjmaxxcom and stp our us ecommerce businesses did not have a significant impact on yearoveryear segment margin comparisons 

segment margin in fiscal 2016 was 143 compared to 146 in fiscal 2015 marmaxx results for fiscal 2016 reflect improvements in merchandise margin and occupancy expense leverage on same store sales growth of approximately 06 percentage points however these gains were offset by higher distribution costs reflecting the increase in units processed as well as higher store payroll primarily due to our wage initiative and processing more units at the store level in addition tjmaxxcom and stp our us ecommerce businesses had a negative impact on yearoveryear segment margin comparisons of 03 percentage points our ecommerce businesses operate at lower profit margins and at stp we incurred additional costs as we continue to transition this business to a more fully offprice model and to adjust its merchandise mix 

in fiscal 2018 we expect to open approximately 65 marmaxx stores which would increase selling square footage by approximately 2 

homegoods 

 

 homegoods’ net sales increased 12 in fiscal 2017 on top of a 15 increase in fiscal 2016 the increase in fiscal 2017 reflected a 6 increase from same store sales and a 6 increase from new store sales the sales increase of 15 in fiscal 2016 reflected a same store sales increase of 8 and an increase from new stores of 7 the increase in same store sales for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic 

segment profit margin for fiscal 2017 was 139 compared to 140 for fiscal 2016 segment margin for fiscal 2017 was favorably impacted by an increase in merchandise margin and expense leverage primarily occupancy costs on strong same store sales growth these increases in segment margin were more than offset by higher payroll costs related to wage increases an increase in distribution costs which includes the opening of a new distribution center in fiscal 2017 and an increase in credit card chargeback costs segment profit margin for fiscal 2016 was 140 up from 136 for fiscal 2015 the increase in fiscal 2016 was driven by expense leverage primarily buying and occupancy costs on strong same store sales growth and an increase in merchandise margin partially offset by an increase in distribution costs and higher payroll costs related to our wage initiative 

in fiscal 2018 we plan an increase of approximately 81 homegoods stores which would increase selling square footage by approximately 11 we also plan on launching a new us home concept with the first few stores opening later in fiscal 2018 

  

foreign segments 

tjx canada 

 

 net sales for tjx canada increased 11 in fiscal 2017 compared to a decrease of 1 in fiscal 2016 the increase in sales for fiscal 2017 reflected same store sales growth of 8 and a 5 increase from new stores offset by 2 from the negative impact of foreign currency translation the decrease in net sales of 1 in fiscal 2016 was due entirely to currency translation which negatively impacted sales growth by 16 more than offsetting sales growth of 12 from same store sales and an increase of 3 from new stores the same store sales increases in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 were primarily due to an increase in customer traffic 

segment profit margin decreased 01 percentage point to 130 in fiscal 2017 the decline in segment margin was driven by a decrease in merchandise margin and higher supply chain and distribution center costs which included the opening of a new distribution center the decline in merchandise margin similar to the prior year was primarily due to transactional foreign exchange as the yearoveryear changes in currency exchange rates increased tjx canada’s cost of merchandise purchased in us dollars these declines in segment margin were largely offset by expense leverage primarily buying and occupancy costs on the same store sales growth as well as the benefit of transactional foreign currency activity resulting in foreign currency gains in fiscal 2017 as compared to foreign currency losses in fiscal 2016 these foreign currency gains and losses result from the timing and settlement of payables denominated in currencies other than the canadian dollar 

segment profit margin decreased 05 percentage points to 131 in fiscal 2016 the decrease in segment margin was primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margins the unfavorable impact of marktomarket adjustments on inventoryrelated derivatives and an increase in incentive pay due to the aboveplan performance collectively these items reduced segment margin by 12 percentage points the decrease in merchandise margin was driven by transactional foreign exchange as the yearoveryear changes in currency exchange rates increased tjx canada’s cost of merchandise purchased in us dollars these declines in the segment margin were partially offset by expense leverage on same store sales particularly buying and occupancy costs 

in fiscal 2018 we plan an increase of approximately 35 stores in canada which would increase selling square footage by approximately 7 

  

tjx international 

 

 net sales for tjx international increased 3 in fiscal 2017 to 44 billion compared to 42 billion in fiscal 2016 on top of a 3 increase in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 the increase in fiscal 2017 reflected a 12 increase from new store sales which includes trade secret for the full fiscal year and a 2 increase from same store sales offset by the unfavorable impact from currency translation of 11 the increase in same store sales for fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic net sales for tjx international increased 3 in fiscal 2016 to 42 billion compared to 41 billion in fiscal 2015 the increase in fiscal 2016 reflected a 9 increase from new store sales and a 4 increase from same store sales offset by the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation of 10 overall ecommerce sales represent approximately 2 of tjx international’s net sales 

segment profit margin decreased 21 percentage points to 54 in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 the inclusion of trade secret for the full year negatively impacted segment margin by 09 percentage points in addition fiscal 2017 segment margin was negatively affected by the unfavorable impact of the marktomarket adjustment of inventory derivatives higher store payroll costs and expense deleverage on the weak same store sales growth 

segment profit margin decreased 07 percentage points to 75 in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 the fiscal 2016 segment margin was favorably impacted by strong buying and occupancy expense leverage on the strong same stores sales increase which was more than offset by the impact of several of our investment initiatives and a decrease in merchandise margin the investment initiatives include costs associated with centralizing support areas of our business investing in our infrastructure to support our growth plans our new store openings in austria and the netherlands and the acquisition of trade secret in australia 

we expect to add approximately 49 stores to tjx international in fiscal 2018 which would increase selling square footage by approximately 6 we plan to rebrand the trade secret stores to tk maxx stores during fiscal 2018 

general corporate expense 

 

 general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments virtually all general corporate expenses are included in selling general 

  

and administrative expenses the increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2017 is driven by continued investments in corporate systems and technology along with increases in compensation benefits and professional services these increases were partially offset by the impact of lower contributions to the tjx charitable foundations in fiscal 2017 than fiscal 2016 

increased contributions to the tjx charitable foundations higher incentive compensation accruals due to our aboveplan performance and costs related to the acquisition of trade secret in australia accounted for approximately 61 million of the increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 3602 million in fiscal 2017 2937 million in fiscal 2016 and 3008 million in fiscal 2015 the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2017 increased by 665 million compared to fiscal 2016 net income adjusted for noncash items and the early extinguishment of debt increased operating cash flows in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 by 86 million the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in an increase of cash of 60 million in fiscal 2017 compared to a use of cash of 290 million in fiscal 2016 positively impacting yearoveryear cash flows by 350 million the positive cash flow impact of the change in inventory and accounts payable in 2017 was due to lower inventory levels at fiscal 2017 year end and increased payments in fiscal 2016 due to merchandise received late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 that was paid for in fiscal 2016 the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash flows by 536 million in fiscal 2017 versus a favorable impact of 353 million in fiscal 2016 this favorable impact of 183 million in yearoveryear cash flows from operations was driven primarily by increased liabilities for deferred compensation gift cards and deferred revenue sales taxes and income taxes payable fiscal 2016 cash flow from operations was reduced by 23 million for the cost to acquire favorable lease rights 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2016 decreased by 71 million compared to fiscal 2015 net income adjusted for the noncash impact of depreciation and deferred income tax provision provided cash of 2926 million in fiscal 2016 compared to 2906 million in fiscal 2015 an increase of 20 million the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of 290 million in fiscal 2016 compared to a use of cash of 47 million in fiscal 2015 negatively impacting yearoveryear cash flows by 243 million the cash flow impact of the change in inventory and accounts payable was primarily due to an increase in packaway inventory at the end of fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year as well as the impact of merchandise received late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 that was paid for in fiscal 2016 the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash flows by 353 million in fiscal 2016 versus a favorable impact of 166 million in fiscal 2015 this favorable impact of 187 million in yearoveryear cash flows from operations was driven primarily by an additional 100 million of voluntary contributions to our qualified pension plan in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2016 lastly fiscal 2016 cash flow from operations was reduced by 23 million for the cost to acquire favorable lease rights 

investing activities our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below 

 

 we expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 will be approximately 12 billion including approximately 600 million for our offices and distribution centers including buying and merchandising systems and 

  

information systems to support growth approximately 350 million for store renovations and approximately 250 million for new stores we plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds 

in fiscal 2017 we purchased 717 million of investments compared to 798 million in fiscal 2016 additionally 529 million of investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2017 compared to 681 million in the prior year this activity primarily relates to shortterm investments which had initial maturities in excess of 90 days and per our policy are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented finally fiscal 2016 investing activities include the initial payment of 57 million for the acquisition of trade secret 

financing activities cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 1562 million in fiscal 2017 2176 million in fiscal 2016 and 1560 million in fiscal 2015 

during the fiscal 2017 third quarter we received net proceeds of 9925 million from the issuance of 1 billion of 225 tenyear notes a portion of the proceeds were used to redeem our 375 million 695 notes prior to their scheduled maturity the redemption of the notes including the prepayment penalty resulted in cash outflows of 426 million the remainder of the proceeds from the notes offering were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes 

tjx repurchased and retired 223 million shares of its common stock at a cost of 17 billion during fiscal 2017 on a “trade date basis” tjx reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis under our stock repurchase programs we spent 17 billion to repurchase 223 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2017 18 billion to repurchase 266 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2016 and 17 billion to repurchase 276 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2015 see note e to the consolidated financial statements for more information in february 2017 we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional 10 billion of tjx stock we currently plan to repurchase approximately 13 billion to 18 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2018 we determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow liquidity economic and market conditions our assessment of prospects for our business legal requirements and other factors the timing and amount of these purchases may change 

we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 104 per share in fiscal 2017 084 per share in fiscal 2016 and 070 per share in fiscal 2015 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 651 million in fiscal 2017 544 million in fiscal 2016 and 466 million in fiscal 2015 we also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 164 million in fiscal 2017 132 million in fiscal 2016 and 143 million in fiscal 2015 we expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2018 of 03125 per share or an annual dividend of 125 per share subject to the declaration and approval of our board of directors this would represent a 20 increase over the per share dividends declared and paid in fiscal 2017 

we traditionally have funded our working capital requirements including for seasonal merchandise primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented as needed by shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper as of january 28 2017 our cash and cash equivalents held outside the us were 13 billion of which 3417 million was held in countries where we have the intention to reinvest any undistributed earnings indefinitely we have provided for deferred us taxes on all undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries in canada puerto rico italy india and hong kong if we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries we would not expect to incur additional tax expense but our cash would be reduced by the amount of taxes paid for all other foreign subsidiaries no income taxes have been provided on the undistributed earnings because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the business we have no current plans to repatriate cash balances held by such foreign subsidiaries we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents internally generated funds and our credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year one of our credit facilities was amended subsequent to the fiscal year end and is more fully described in note k to the consolidated financial statements 

  

contractual obligations as of january 28 2017 we had known contractual obligations including current installments under longterm debt arrangements operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows in thousands 

 

  

  

  

 we also have longterm liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include 4717 million for employee compensation and benefits and 367 million for uncertain tax positions 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to the areas described below 

inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except stp and trade secret the businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale ie inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced typically a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns however as a normal business practice we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end historically the variance between estimated shrinkage and actual shrinkage has not been material to our annual financial results we do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and tradenames we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets goodwill and tradenames at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores as well as of our business units which involve a number of factors including historical trends recent performance and general economic assumptions if we determine that an impairment of longlived assets goodwill and tradenames has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets we determine the fair value of our business units using the discounted cash flow method which requires assumptions for the weighted average cost of capital wacc and revenue growth for the related business unit the fair value of our business units exceeds their carrying value by a significant amount with the exception of 

  

sierra trading post stp currently the fair value of stp exceeds the carrying value by approximately 10 our valuation for stp assumes a wacc of 101 for similar type entities and a perpetuity growth rate of 2 an increase of 50 basis points in the wacc reduces the valuation by approximately 30 million and a decrease in the perpetuity growth rate of 50 basis points reduces the fair value by approximately 10 to 15 million the valuation also assumes 15 to 20 new stores are opened annually over the next 10 years we continue to transition stp from a promotional model to the offprice model and expand its store base although we are optimistic about the future of stp since its acquisition these changes have resulted in operating results that have not met our short term expectations the operating results of stp are not material to tjx’s consolidated results if however their operating results continue to fall short of our projections it is possible we could be faced with an impairment of some or all of the 97 million of goodwill recorded at the time of acquisition 

retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates we are required to make economic demographic and other assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations the longterm rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets and assumptions about mortality all of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period these assumptions including the discount rate which we determine annually based on market interest rates and our estimated longterm rate of return which can differ considerably from actual returns can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan if our discount rate decreased 025 percentage points our fiscal 2017 pension cost for our funded plan would have increased by approximately 10 million similarly an increase in the discount of rate of 025 percentage points would result in a comparable reduction of pension cost a change of 025 percentage points in our longterm rate of return would increase or decrease our fiscal 2017 pension cost by approximately 3 million when the discount rate market performance of our plan assets changes in laws regulations actuarial standards or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan our required contributions may increase we also consider these factors in determining the amount of voluntary contributions we may make to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements in fiscal 2017 we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of 50 million 

sharebased compensation in accordance with gaap we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan the fair value of the awards is amortized as “sharebased compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service we use the blackscholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results the use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost a 5 increase in expected volatility would increase the peroption value of our most recent option award by 6 while a decrease of the same amount would decrease the peroption value of our most recent option award by 6 

casualty insurance our casualty insurance program is a selfinsured program which requires us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost the estimated claims are developed with the assistance of an actuary based on historical experience and other factors these estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates if our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance for fiscal 2017 were to change by 5 the fiscal 2017 pretax cost would increase or decrease by approximately 4 million a large portion of these claims is funded with a nonrefundable payment during the policy year offsetting our estimated claims accrual we had a net accrual of 308 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of january 28 2017 

reserves for uncertain tax positions like many large corporations our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation assessment examination litigation and settlement the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain in accordance with gaap we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely 

  

than not based on the technical merits that the positions we have taken will not be sustained however in the next twelve months and in future periods the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay as the result of the final resolutions of examinations judicial or administrative proceedings changes in facts law or legal interpretations expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of or changes in tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

loss contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our management with the assistance of our legal counsel assesses such contingent liabilities such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable

flexible business model our flexible offprice business model including our opportunistic buying inventory management logistics and store layouts is designed to deliver our customers a compelling value proposition of fashionable quality brand name and designer merchandise at excellent values every day our buying and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than traditional retailers and the design and operation of our stores and distribution centers support this flexibility our merchants have more visibility into consumer fashion and market trends and pricing when we buy closer to need which can help us “buy smarter” and reduce our markdown exposure our selling floor space is flexible without walls between departments and largely free of permanent fixtures so we can easily expand and contract departments to accommodate the merchandise we purchase our logistics and distribution operations are designed to support our buying strategies and to facilitate quick efficient and differentiated delivery of merchandise to our stores with a goal of getting the right merchandise to the right stores at the right times 

opportunistic buying as an offprice retailer our buying practices which we refer to as opportunistic buying differentiate us from traditional retailers our overall buying strategy is to acquire merchandise on an ongoing basis that will enable us to offer a desirable and rapidly changing mix of branded designer and other quality merchandise in our stores at prices below regular prices for comparable merchandise at department and specialty stores we seek out and select merchandise from the broad range of opportunities in the marketplace to achieve this end our buying organization which numbers more than 1000 associates in 15 buying offices in 11 countries executes this opportunistic buying strategy in a variety of ways depending on market conditions and other factors 

we take advantage of opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from the production and flow of inventory in the apparel and home fashions marketplace these opportunities include among others order cancellations manufacturer overruns closeouts and special production direct from brands and factories our buying strategies are intentionally flexible to allow us to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market and to adjust how and what we source as well as when we source it our goal is to operate with lean inventory levels compared to conventional retailers to give us the flexibility to seek out and to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise in contrast to traditional retailers which tend to order most of their goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor our merchants generally remain in the marketplace throughout the year frequently looking for opportunities to buy merchandise we buy much of our merchandise for the current or immediately upcoming selling season we also buy some merchandise that is available in the market with the intention of storing it for sale typically in future selling seasons we generally make these purchases referred to as packaway in response to opportunities in the marketplace to buy merchandise that we believe has the right combination of brand fashion price and quality to supplement the product we expect to be available to purchase later for those future seasons we also acquire some merchandise that we offer under inhouse brands or brands that are licensed to us we develop some of this merchandise ourselves in order to supplement the depth of or fill gaps in our expected merchandise assortment 

  

our expansive vendor universe which is in excess of 18000 consists primarily of manufacturers along with retailers and other vendors and provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quality merchandise for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments and expect this will continue as we continue to grow we believe a number of factors provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise and make us an attractive channel for many vendors in the market we are typically willing to purchase lessthanfull assortments of items styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large we are able to disperse merchandise across our geographically diverse network of stores and to target specific markets we pay promptly we generally do not ask for typical retail concessions such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries or return privileges and we have financial strength and an excellent credit rating 

inventory management we offer our customers a rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a treasure hunt experience in our stores and to spur frequent customer visits to achieve this we seek to turn the inventory in our stores rapidly regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions at excellent values our specialized inventory planning purchasing monitoring and markdown systems coupled with distribution center storage processing handling and shipping systems enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local preferences and demographics achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of products and generally sell within the period we planned we make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations centrally using information provided by specialized computer systems designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner over the past several years we have been investing in our supply chain with the goal of continuing to operate with low inventory levels to ship more efficiently and quickly and to more precisely and effectively allocate merchandise to each store 

pricing our mission is to offer quality fashionable brand name and designer merchandise in our stores with retail prices that are generally 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular retail prices on comparable merchandise every day we do not generally engage in promotional pricing activity such as sales or coupons we have generally been able to react to price fluctuations in the wholesale market to maintain our pricing gap relative to prices offered by traditional retailers as well as our merchandise margins through various economic cycles 

low cost operations we operate with a low cost structure compared to many traditional retailers we focus aggressively on expenses throughout our business our advertising is generally focused on promoting our retail banners rather than individual products including at times promoting multiple banners together which contributes to our advertising budget as a percentage of sales remaining low compared to many traditional retailers we design our stores to provide a pleasant convenient shopping environment but relative to other retailers do not spend heavily on store fixtures additionally our distribution network is designed to run cost effectively 

customer serviceshopping experience we continue to renovate and upgrade our stores across our retail banners to enhance our customers’ shopping experience and help drive sales although we offer a selfservice format we train our store associates to provide friendly and helpful customer service and seek to staff our stores to deliver a positive shopping experience we typically offer customerfriendly return policies we accept a variety of payment methods including cash credit cards and debit cards we also offer tjxbranded credit cards in the us through a bank but do not own the customer receivables 

distribution we operate distribution centers encompassing approximately 14 million square feet in six countries these centers are generally large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model we ship substantially all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers as well as warehouses and shipping centers operated by third parties

 item 1a risk factors tableend the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks that follow individually or in the aggregate are those that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements 

failure to execute our opportunistic buying strategy and inventory management could adversely affect our business 

while opportunistic buying operating with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are key elements of our offprice business strategy they subject us to risks related to the pricing quantity mix nature and timing of inventory flowing to our stores our merchants are in the marketplace frequently as much of our merchandise is purchased for the current or immediately upcoming season and our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion with them our business model expects them to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market assess the desirability and value of merchandise and generally make determinations of how and what we source as well as when we source it if we do not obtain the right fresh desirable merchandise at the right times quantities and prices or the right mix of merchandise it could adversely affect customer traffic as well as our sales and margins 

we base our purchases of inventory in part on our sales forecasts if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory leading to decreased profit margins or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales either of which could adversely affect our financial performance 

if we are unable to generally purchase inventory at prices sufficiently below prices paid by conventional retailers we may not be able to maintain an overall pricing differential to regular department and specialty stores and our ability to attract customers or sustain our margins may be adversely affected we may not achieve this at various times or in some segments chains or geographies which could adversely affect our results 

we must also properly execute our inventory management strategy of delivering the right product to the right stores at the right time we need to appropriately allocate merchandise among our stores timely and efficiently distribute inventory to stores maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store appropriately change the allocation of floor space of stores among product categories to respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns if we are not able to do so our ability to attract and retain customers and our results could be adversely affected 

in addition to our own execution we may need to react to factors affecting inventory flow that are outside our control discussed further below such as adverse weather and natural disasters or changes in conditions affecting our vendors and others in our supply chain such as political instability labor issues including port labor disputes strikes or threats of strikes or increasing cost of compliance with regulations if we are not able to adjust appropriately to such factors our inventory management may be affected which could impact our performance and our relationship with our customers 

failure to continue to expand our business and operations successfully or to manage our substantial size and scale effectively could adversely affect our financial results 

our growth strategy includes successfully expanding our offprice model within our current markets and into new geographic regions product lines businesses and channels and as appropriate adding new businesses whether by development investment or acquisition there are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to expand successfully including managing the implementation of this growth effectively if any aspect of our expansion strategy does not achieve the success we expect in whole or in part we may be required to 

  

increase our investment slow our planned growth or close stores or operations which could adversely affect our financial performance for example successful store growth requires us to find and lease appropriate real estate on attractive terms in each of the locations where we seek to open stores our ability to do so depends among other things on availability and selection of appropriate sites in appropriate geographies degree of competition for sites factors affecting costs such as real estate construction and development costs and costs and availability of capital and variations in or changes to zoning or other land use regulations if we cannot lease appropriate sites on attractive terms it could limit our ability to successfully grow in various markets or adversely affect the economics of new stores in various markets there are risks in entering new markets including those detailed further below new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores whether in current or new markets and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect our sales and profitability 

further our substantial size may add operational complexity and imposes demands on maintaining appropriate internal resources and third party providers to support our business effectively these demands may increase as we grow our business adding pressure to management and various functions across our business including administration merchandising store operations distribution and compliance and on appropriately staffing and training personnel in these areas as we grow the large size and scale of our operations our multiple chains in the us canada and europe and our new chain in australia and the autonomy afforded to the chains in some aspects of the business increase the risk that our systems controls practices and policies will not be implemented effectively throughout our company and that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations these risks may increase as we continue to grow particularly as we expand into additional countries if business information is not shared effectively or if we are otherwise unable to manage our size or growth effectively we may operate with decreased operational efficiency may need to reduce our rate of expansion of one or more operations or otherwise curtail growth in one or more markets which may adversely affect our success in executing our business goals and adversely impact our sales and results 

failure to identify customer trends and preferences to meet customer demand in new or existing markets or channels could negatively impact our performance 

because our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand we work to identify customer trends and preferences on an ongoing basis and to offer inventory that meets those trends and preferences however doing so on a timely basis across our diverse merchandise categories and in the many markets in the us canada europe and australia in which we do business is challenging trends and preferences in new markets may differ from what we anticipate although our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer preferences and trends and to expand and contract merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes we may not successfully do so which could add difficulty in successfully entering new markets attracting new customers retaining existing customers encouraging frequent visits and adversely affect our results 

customers may also have expectations about how they shop in stores or through ecommerce or more generally engage with businesses across different channels or media through internetbased and other digital or mobile channels or particular forms of social media which may vary across demographics and may evolve rapidly meeting demand effectively involves identifying the right opportunities and making the right investments at the right time and with the right speed among other things and failure to do so may impact our reputation and our financial results 

if we fail to successfully implement our various marketing efforts or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise may be influenced by our marketing efforts the name recognition and reputation of our chains and the location of and service offered in our stores although we use marketing to drive customer traffic through various media including television social media database marketing mobile marketing print and direct marketing some of our competitors expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage internetbased and other digital or mobile communication channels and other social media rapidly evolve our programs 

  

may not be or remain effective or could require increased expenditures which could have a significant adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive we compete with local regional national and international retailers that sell apparel home fashions and other merchandise we sell including in stores through ecommerce catalogues or other media some of our competitors are larger than we are or have more experience in selling certain product lines than we do new competitors frequently enter the market and existing competitors enter or increase their presence in the markets in which we operate expand their merchandise offerings add new sales channels or change their pricing methods all of which increase competition for customers we compete on the basis of value meaning a combination of brand fashion price quality merchandise selection and freshness brand name recognition customer service reputation and store location our competitiveness is highly dependent on our effective execution of our offprice model of offering our customers a fresh rapidly changing and attractive mix of merchandise delivering value if we fail to compete effectively our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 

failure to attract train and retain quality associates in appropriate numbers including key associates and management could adversely affect our performance 

our performance depends on recruiting developing training and retaining quality sales systems distribution center and other associates in large numbers as well as experienced associates in key areas such as buying and management many of our associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover availability and skill of associates may differ across markets in which we do business and in new markets we enter and we need to manage our labor needs effectively in addition because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must provide significant internal training and development for key associates across the company including within our buying organization similar to other retailers we face challenges in securing and retaining sufficient talent in management and other key areas for many reasons including competition in the retail industry generally and for talent in various geographic markets if we do not continue to attract qualified individuals train them in our business model support their development and retain them our performance could be adversely affected or our growth could be limited 

labor costs including pension and healthcare costs and other challenges from our large workforce may adversely affect our results and profitability 

we have a large workforce and our ability to meet our labor needs is subject to various factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates and wage requirements participant benefit levels changing demographics economic conditions interest rate changes economic demographic and other actuarial assumptions health and other insurance costs and the regulatory environment including health care legislation immigration law and governmental labor and employment and employee benefits programs and requirements each of which could increase our costs increased labor costs including costs of providing retirement health and other employment benefits may adversely affect our results of operations in addition when wage rates or benefit levels increase in a market increasing our wages or benefits may negatively impact our earnings as they did during fiscal 2016 while failing to increase our wages or benefits competitively or reducing our wages or benefits could result in a decline in our ability to attract or retain associates or in the quality of our workforce causing our customer service or performance to suffer which could impact our results certain associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions of various kinds as well as risks and potential expenses associated with multiemployer plans including from potential withdrawal liability and potential insolvency of other participating employers other associates are members of works councils which may subject us to additional actions or expense in addition any failure of third parties that perform services on our behalf to comply with immigration employment or other laws and regulations could damage our reputation or disrupt our ability to obtain needed labor 

  

compromises of our data security could materially harm our reputation and business 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect store process and transmit certain information from individuals such as our customers and associates including for example customer payment card and check information we rely in part on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of personal andor confidential information as with many other companies particularly in the retail industry we are subject to attempts to compromise our data security computer hackers may for example attempt to penetrate our computer systems or those of the third parties with whom we work or to whom we outsource business operations and if successful misappropriate customer or associate information or confidential business information of our company while we have taken steps designed to further strengthen the security of our computer system since the unauthorized intrusions into our network discovered late in 2006 in which we believe customer data were stolen there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a future data compromise that unauthorized parties will not gain access to the information that we collect store process or transmit or that any such data compromise or unauthorized access will be discovered in a timely way in addition an associate contractor or third party with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations may fail to monitor their or our systems effectively may fail to maintain appropriate safeguards or one of those parties may misuse the personal or confidential information to which they have access may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to access or misappropriate such types of information or may purposefully or through error inadvertently cause a breach involving or otherwise disclose such information advances in computer and software technology and capabilities rapid changes in the sources methods and targets of cyberattacks and other developments including the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals generally may increase the risk of such a breach 

compromise of our data security or that of third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business information and delays in detecting any such compromise or loss could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and decrease our customers’ willingness to shop in our stores or online impact our ability to attract and retain customers violate applicable laws regulations orders and agreements and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material 

failure to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information systems including data centers hardware and software and applications to manage many aspects of our business including to process and record transactions in our stores to enable effective communication systems to plan and track inventory flow to manage logistics to generate performance and financial reports and to operate our ecommerce sites we are dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems supporting these internal and external systems requires a number of resources including effective and qualified and in some cases specialized teams as we grow and as our systems evolve we must continue to hire train manage and retain these teams including to support our customized and legacy systems in an effective way our computer systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are also subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes including power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses or malware security breaches cyberattacks catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and design or usage errors by our associates or contractors although we seek to maintain our systems effectively manage our team of internal and third party resources effectively and successfully address the risk of compromises of the integrity security and consistent operations of our systems we may not be successful in doing so compromises interruptions or shutdowns of our systems including those managed by third parties whether intentional or inadvertent could lead to delays in our business operations and if significant or extreme affect our results of operations in addition any interruption in the operation of our websites particularly our ecommerce sites could cause us to suffer reputational harm or to lose sales if customers are unable to access our site or purchase merchandise from us during such an interruption 

  

we modify update and replace our systems and infrastructure from time to time including by adding new hardware software and applications maintaining updating or replacing legacy programs converting to global systems integrating new service providers and adding enhanced or new functionality such as for cloud computing technologies and for the continued operation and development of our ecommerce businesses and adding new systems when we acquire new businesses we also modify and change our procedures for and add and change vendors and internal teams who assist us with designing implementing and maintaining our systems although we believe we are diligent in selecting systems teams and vendors and implementing procedures to enable us to maintain the integrity of our systems when we modify them there are inherent risks associated with modifying or replacing systems with new or changed relationships and with changes from acquisitions including accurately capturing and maintaining data efficiently testing and implementing changes in a timely manner realizing the expected benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption of the operation of the systems and diversion to internal teams’ attention as the changes are implemented further potential issues associated with implementing technology initiatives and the time and resources required to optimize the benefits of new elements of our systems and its infrastructure could reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends upon our information systems including our ability to operate and maintain them effectively to select appropriate internal teams and vendors to maintain or enhance them and to select and implement appropriate new technologies systems controls hardware software and applications and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems and the third party systems we rely on to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm our profitability 

economic conditions on a global level or in particular markets may adversely affect our financial performance 

global financial markets can experience extreme volatility disruption and credit contraction which adversely affect global economic conditions turmoil in the financial and credit markets or other changes in economic conditions could adversely affect sources of liquidity available to us or our costs of capital and could adversely affect plan asset values and investment performance and increase our pension liabilities expenses and funding requirements with respect to companysponsored and multiemployer pension plans economic conditions both on a global level and in particular markets including unemployment decreased disposable income and actual and perceived wealth energy and health care costs interest and tax rates and policies weakness in the housing market volatility in capital markets decreased credit availability inflation and deflation as well as political or other factors beyond our control such as threats or possibilities of war terrorism global or national unrest actual or threatened epidemics and political instability may also have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending consumer spending in turn affects retail sales these conditions and factors could adversely affect discretionary consumer spending and although we believe our flexible offprice model helps us react they may adversely affect our sales cash flows and results of operations and performance 

adverse or unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate or along our supply chain could adversely affect our operating results 

both adverse and unseasonable weather such as storms severe cold or heat or unseasonable temperatures affect customers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop certain categories or at all and accordingly can adversely affect the demand for the merchandise in our stores particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise weather can also affect the ability to transport merchandise to our stores from our distribution and shipping centers or elsewhere in our supply chain efficiently or in a timely way as a result adverse or unseasonable weather could adversely affect our sales increase markdowns and adversely affect our operating results 

our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic events 

unforeseen public health issues such as pandemics and epidemics natural or other disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other extreme weather and climate conditions or fires explosions and acts of war or terrorism could disrupt our operations or the operations of one or more of our vendors or of our supply chain or could severely damage or destroy one or more of our stores or distribution 

  

facilities located in the affected areas daytoday operations particularly our ability to receive products from our vendors or transport products to our stores could be adversely affected or we could be required to close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by affected distribution centers for a short or extended period of time as a result our business could be adversely affected 

as our business is subject to seasonal influences a decrease in sales or margins a severe disruption or other significant event that impacts our business during the second half of the year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operating results 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we generally realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the year which includes the backtoschool and yearend holiday seasons any decrease in sales or margins or any significant adverse event during this period could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations 

damage to our corporate reputation or those of our retail banners could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

we believe that building the brand reputation of our retail banners is important to our continuing success in the many different markets in which we do business we work to build relationships with our customers through our various marketing campaigns these relationships and our reputation are based in part on perceptions of subjective qualities so incidents involving us merchandise that we carry or our industry more generally that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business particularly if the incidents result in rapid or significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry similarly information about us our retail banners and the merchandise we sell including our licensed or owned brands publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues including blogs websites and other forums for rapid broad communications to an audience of consumers and other interested persons may adversely affect our reputation and brand even if the information is unverified or inaccurate the reputation of our company and our retail banners may be damaged by adverse events at the corporate level or at our retail banners in all one or some of the markets in which we do business damage to the reputation of our company and our banners could result in declines in customer loyalty and sales affect our vendor relationships development opportunities and associate retention and otherwise adversely affect our business 

quality safety or other issues with merchandise we sell could damage our reputation sales and financial results 

various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we sell to consumers regulations and standards in this area including those related to the us consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 state regulations like california’s proposition 65 and similar legislation in other countries in which we operate impose restrictions and requirements on the merchandise we sell in our stores and through ecommerce these regulations change from time to time and new federal state provincial or local regulations in the us and other countries that may affect our business are contemplated and enacted with some regularity if we or our merchandise vendors are unable to comply with regulatory requirements on a timely basis or at all or to adequately monitor new regulations that may apply to existing or new merchandise categories or in new geographies significant fines or penalties could be incurred or we could have to curtail some aspects of our sales or operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results we rely on our vendors to provide quality merchandise that complies with applicable product safety laws and other applicable laws but they may not comply with their obligations to do so although our arrangements with our vendors frequently provide for indemnification for product liabilities the vendors may fail to honor those obligations to an extent we consider sufficient or at all issues with the quality and safety of merchandise particularly with food bath and body and children’s products and issues with the genuineness of merchandise or customer concerns about such issues regardless of our fault could cause damage to our reputation and could result in lost sales uninsured product liability claims or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs and regulatory civil or criminal fines or penalties any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

  

our expanding international operations may expose us to risks inherent in operating in new countries 

we have a significant retail presence in canada and in countries in europe and have established buying offices around the world we have recently expanded our operations into additional markets in europe and australia and our goal is to continue to expand our operations into other international markets in the future it can be costly and complex to establish develop and maintain international operations and promote business in new international jurisdictions which may differ significantly from the us and other countries in which we currently operate in addition to facing risks similar to our us and current international operations such as with regulations like the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act there are additional risks inherent in opening and developing operations in new countries these additional risks include among others understanding the local retail climate and trends local customs and cultures seasonal differences business practices and competitive conditions complying with relevant laws rules and regulations developing the appropriate infrastructure and identifying suitable partners for local operations and for integration with our global operations there are also financial regulatory and other risks associated with international operations including currency exchange fluctuations potentially adverse tax consequences limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds outside of the country where earned trade regulations the risk of sudden policy or regulatory changes the risk of political economic and civil instability and labor unrest and uncertainties regarding interpretation application and enforceability of laws and agreements any of these risks could adversely impact our operations profitability or liquidity complying with applicable laws rules and regulations and our own internal policies may also require us to spend additional time and resources to implement new procedures and financial and other controls conduct audits train associates and third parties on our compliance methods or take other actions any of which could adversely impact our operations 

we are subject to risks associated with importing merchandise from other countries 

many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a lesser extent by us in many countries outside of the country where the stores are located particularly southeastern asia where we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those imposed upon the manufacturer of such products we are subject to the various risks of importing merchandise from other countries and purchasing product made in other countries such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 these and other factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise beyond our control could affect the availability and the price of our inventory furthermore although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to operating in nonus jurisdictions and importing merchandise there can be no assurance that contractors agents vendors or other third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our reputation operations or operating results 

our results may be adversely affected by reduced availability or increases in the price of oil or other fuels raw materials and other commodities 

energy and fuel costs can fluctuate dramatically and at times have resulted in significant cost increases particularly for the price of oil and gasoline an increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers although we typically implement a hedging strategy designed to manage a portion of our transportation costs that strategy may not be effective or sufficient and could result in increased operating costs increases in oil and gasoline prices could also adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products increased operating costs and decreased consumer spending and demand for our products could have an adverse effect on our results of operations either individually or in the aggregate increased regulation related to environmental costs including cap and trade or other emissions management systems could also adversely affect our costs of doing business including utility transportation and logistics costs similarly other commodity prices can fluctuate dramatically such as the cost of cotton and synthetic fabrics which at times have risen significantly such increases can increase the cost of merchandise which could adversely affect our performance through potentially reduced consumer demand or reduced margins 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and changes in currency exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into us dollars for financial reporting purposes because of this movements in currency exchange rates have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our consolidated and segment results from time to time changes in currency exchange rates can also increase the cost of inventory purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the business buying the merchandise when exchange rates change significantly in a short period or move unfavorably over an extended period as they did in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 respectively it can be difficult for us to adjust retail prices accordingly and gross margin can be adversely affected in addition a significant amount of merchandise we offer for sale is made in china and accordingly a revaluation of chinese currency or increased market flexibility in the exchange rate for that currency increasing its value relative to the us dollar or currencies in which our stores are located could be significant 

additionally we routinely enter into inventoryrelated derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rates on merchandise margins of merchandise purchases by our segments denominated in currencies other than their local currencies in accordance with gaap we evaluate the fair value of these derivative instruments and make marktomarket adjustments at the end of each accounting period these adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our earnings 

although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates we expect that currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations from time to time in addition fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our earnings and operating results if a counterparty to one of our hedging arrangements fails to perform 

  

our quarterly operating results fluctuate and may fall short of prior periods our projections or the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past and they may do so in the future if we fail to increase our results over prior periods to achieve our projected results or to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price may decline and the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance results may be affected by various factors including those described in these risk factors we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to project sales and align expenses if we do not control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results or if actual results differ significantly from our forecast our financial performance could be adversely affected in addition if we do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplated pursuant to our stock repurchase programs our earnings per share may be adversely affected 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions or investments in new businesses or divest close or consolidate any of our current businesses our business will be subject to additional risks 

we may acquire new businesses as we did with trade secret in fiscal 2016 and stp in fiscal 2013 invest in or enter into joint ventures with other businesses develop new businesses internally and divest close or consolidate businesses failure to execute on mergers acquisitions investments divestitures closings and consolidations in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition acquisition investment or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses and we may not effectively evaluate target companies investments or investment partners or assess the risks benefits and cost of buying investing in or closing businesses or of the integration of acquired businesses all of which can be difficult timeconsuming and dilutive these activities may not meet our performance and other expectations and may expose us to unexpected or greaterthanexpected costs liabilities and risks if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions we may be required to impair some or all of the goodwill associated with an acquisition which could adversely impact our results of operations divestitures closings and consolidations could involve risks such as significant costs and obligations of closure including exposure on leases owned real estate and other contractual employment pension and severance obligations and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer 

failure to comply with existing laws regulations and orders or changes in existing laws regulations and applicable accounting principles and interpretations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

we are subject to federal state provincial regional and local laws rules and regulations in the united states and other countries any of which may change from time to time as well as orders and assurances these legal regulatory and administrative requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business from the cost of providing health care and retirement benefits workforce management logistics marketing importexport sourcing and manufacturing data protection and others if we fail to comply with these laws rules regulations and orders we may be subject to judgments fines or other costs or penalties which could materially adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition 

we must also comply with new and changing laws and regulations new regulatory initiatives evolving interpretation of existing laws by judicial and regulatory authorities and reforms in jurisdictions where we do business these changes could increase our costs of compliance or of doing business and could adversely affect our operating results including those involving 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

 further applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time and the changes could have material effects on our reported financial results and condition 

our results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation legal proceedings and other legal or regulatory matters 

we are involved or may in the future become involved in legal proceedings regulatory reviews audits and other legal matters these may involve inquiries investigations lawsuits and other proceedings by local provincial state and federal governmental entities in the united states and other countries and private plaintiffs including with respect to tax escheat whistleblower claims employment and employee benefits including classification employment rights discrimination wage and hour and retaliation securities disclosure real estate tort consumer protection privacydata security product safety advertising and intellectual property there continue to be a number of employmentrelated and consumer protection lawsuits including putative class actions in the united states and we are subject to these types of suits we cannot predict the results of legal and regulatory proceedings with certainty and actual results may differ from any reserves we establish estimating the probable outcome regardless of merit or outcome litigation can be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expense and diversion of management attention legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations could expose us to significant defense costs fines penalties and liability to private parties and governmental entities for monetary recoveries and other amounts and attorneys’ fees andor require us to change aspects of our operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including the results of tax audits and examinations income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory income tax rates changes in income tax rates changes in transfer pricing changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in applicable tax legislation regulations and treaties exposure to additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision and accruals for taxes and actual results may differ from our estimations 

in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state provincial and local tax authorities in the us and foreign countries and the examining authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various proceedings which are at various stages with such authorities with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these proceedings to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of our provision for income taxes and increase and decrease our provision as a result of these assessments however the developments in and actual results of proceedings or the result of rulings by or settlements with tax authorities and courts or due to changes in facts law or legal interpretations expiration of applicable statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions could differ from the amounts we have accrued for such proceedings in either a positive or a negative manner which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations in addition we are subject to tax audits and examinations for payroll value added salesbased and other taxes relating to our businesses 

our real estate leases generally obligate us for long periods which subjects us to financial risks 

we lease virtually all of our store locations generally for an initial term of 10 years with options to renew the term in the us and canada or an initial term of 10 to 15 years in europe in addition we either own or lease for 

  

long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices accordingly we are subject to the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate which can adversely affect our results as for example was the case in the closures of various of our former operations while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions including by making specified payments we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so if we decide to close stores we are generally required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases which generally include among other things paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or paying to exercise rights to terminate and the performance of any of these obligations may be expensive when we assign leases or sublease space to third parties we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform in addition when the lease term for the stores in our ongoing operations expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close stores or to relocate stores within a market on less favorable terms 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our operations growth stock repurchases and dividends and interest and debt repayment 

our business depends upon our operations to continue to generate strong cash flow to supply capital to support our general operating activities to fund our growth and our return of cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase programs and dividends and to pay our interest and debt repayments our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or to repatriate cash from our international operations in a manner that is cost effective could adversely affect our growth plans and financial performance including our earnings per share we borrow on occasion to finance our activities and if financing were not available to us in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed it could also adversely affect our financial performance

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the discussion that follows relates to our 52week fiscal years ended january 30 2016 fiscal 2016 january 31 2015 fiscal 2015 and february 1 2014 fiscal 2014 

overview 

we are the leading offprice apparel and home fashions retailer in the us and worldwide we sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices on comparable merchandise every day we operate over 3600 stores through our four main segments in the us marmaxx which operates tj maxx marshalls and tjmaxxcom and homegoods tjx canada which operates winners homesense and marshalls in canada and tjx international formerly tjx europe which operates tk maxx homesense and tkmaxxcom in europe and trade secret in australia in the us we also operate sierra trading post stp a leading offprice internet retailer with a small number of stores the results of stp are reported in our marmaxx segment 

fiscal 2016 was another successful year for tjx as we posted strong gains in net sales and solid earnings per share growth on top of strong increases in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 we continued to generate strong cash flows allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases while continuing to reinvest in our business by adding new stores and remodeling existing ones and while continuing to strengthen our infrastructure in support of our continuing growth in fiscal 2016 we implemented the first phase of an initiative to raise wages for our us full and parttime hourly store associates the second phase of additional wage increases will occur in fiscal 2017 

highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2016 include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results followed by a discussion of our segment operating results 

net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal 2016 totaled 309 billion a 6 increase over 291 billion in fiscal 2015 the increase reflected a 4 increase from new stores and a 5 increase from same store sales offset by a 3 negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates net sales from our ecommerce businesses amount to approximately 1 of total sales and had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2016 sales growth consolidated net sales for fiscal 2015 totaled 291 billion a 6 increase over 274 billion in fiscal 2014 the increase reflected a 4 increase from new stores and a 2 increase from same store sales foreign currency exchange rates and ecommerce sales had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2015 net sales growth 

same store sales increases in the us for fiscal 2016 were due to an increase in customer traffic we also had a strong increase in units sold which was offset by a reduction in the average ticket in fiscal 2016 home fashions performed better than apparel but both recorded strong same store sales growth geographically in the us sales were strong in virtually all regions with the southeast reporting the highest same store sales growth in canada same store sales increases were well above the consolidated average while tjx international was slightly below the consolidated average 

same store sales increases in the us for fiscal 2015 were driven by increases in the value of the average transaction and customer traffic in fiscal 2015 within apparel sales from jewelry and accessories and activewear performed particularly well as did home fashions geographically in the us sales were strongest in the southeast and southwest same store sales increases at tjx international and tjx canada were above the consolidated average 

we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation the sales of sierra trading post including stores tjmaxxcom and tkmaxxcom our ecommerce businesses are not included in same store sales we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria the newly acquired trade secret stores will be included in same store sales when they meet the above definition we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated on a constant currency basis meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance we define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the same store sales calculation and define average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold we define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the same store sales calculation 

  

the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales 

 

  

 impact of foreign currency exchange rates  our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows 

 

  

 we refer to the impact of the above two items throughout our discussion as “foreign currency” this does not include the impact currency exchange rates can have on various transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an operating division’s local currency when discussing the impact on our results of the effect of currency exchange rates on such transactions we refer to it as “transactional foreign exchange” 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 712 in fiscal 2016 compared to 715 in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 the improvement in this expense ratio was driven by leverage on buying and occupancy costs as a result of the 5 same store sales increase along with an increase on our profit margin on merchandise sold merchandise margin together these two items benefitted the fiscal 2016 expense ratio by approximately 05 percentage points merchandise margin improved despite the negative impact transactional foreign exchange had on the cost of merchandise for canada and europe this year versus last year the change in exchange rates increased the cost of merchandise purchased by canada and europe that were denominated in currencies other than their local currency primarily the us dollar this expense ratio was also negatively impacted by increased freight and distribution costs associated with moving more units through our supply chain and the mark to 

  

market of inventory derivatives the fiscal 2015 expense ratio was comparable to that of fiscal 2014 with a slight increase in the fiscal 2015 merchandise margin 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 168 in fiscal 2016 161 in fiscal 2015 and 163 in fiscal 2014 the increase in this ratio in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a combination of higher employee payroll costs due to our wage initiative and an increase in units handled at the stores along with our incremental investments and increased contributions to tjx’s charitable foundations 

the reduction in this ratio for fiscal 2015 was largely due to a reduction in our reserves for former operations in fiscal 2015 as well as costs incurred in fiscal 2014 relating to our home office relocations 

loss on early extinguishment of debt on july 8 2014 we redeemed our 400 million aggregate principal amount of 420 notes due august 2015 and recorded a pretax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of 168 million 

interest expense net the components of interest expense net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

 

 the increase in net interest expense for fiscal 2016 reflects interest expense in fiscal 2016 on the financing lease obligation related to tjx canada’s new home office of 37 million the increase in net interest expense also reflects a reduction in capitalized interest costs and interest income in the fiscal 2016 periods as compared to the same periods last year 

the increase in net interest expense for fiscal 2015 reflected the interest cost from the date of issuance june 5 2014 on the 750 million 275 sevenyear notes in addition fiscal 2015 included 12 months of interest expense on the 500 million 250 tenyear notes compared to fiscal 2014 which only reflected nine months of interest expense these costs were partially offset by interest savings due to the redemption of the 400 million 420 notes the reduction in capitalized interest on ongoing capital projects is partially offset by an increase in interest income driven by higher cash balances 

income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was 377 in fiscal 2016 376 in fiscal 2015 and 356 in fiscal 2014 the increase in the fiscal 2016 income tax rate was due to the jurisdictional mix of income and the valuation allowance on foreign net operating losses the increase in the fiscal 2015 effective income tax rate as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the impact on the fiscal 2014 income tax rate from tax benefits in fiscal 2014 of approximately 80 million which were primarily due to a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with state taxing authorities and the reversal of valuation allowances against foreign net operating loss carryforwards these benefits reduced the fiscal 2014 effective income tax rate by 22 percentage points see note k to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to income taxes 

net income and diluted earnings per share net income was 23 billion in fiscal 2016 a 3 increase over 22 billion in fiscal 2015 which in turn was a 4 increase over 21 billion in fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share were 333 in fiscal 2016 315 in fiscal 2015 and 294 in fiscal 2014 the aftertax cost for the loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 reduced earnings per share for fiscal 2015 by 001 per share the tax benefits referred to above added 011 to earnings per share for fiscal 2014 foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results foreign currency exchange rates had a 009 negative impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015 and a 002 negative impact in fiscal 2015 when compared to fiscal 2014 

  

our stock repurchase programs which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding benefited our earnings per share growth in fiscal 2016 by approximately 3 we repurchased 265 million shares of our stock at a cost of 18 billion in fiscal 2016 277 million shares of our stock at a cost of 17 billion in fiscal 2015 and 270 million shares of our stock at a cost of 15 billion in fiscal 2014 

segment information we operate four main business segments our marmaxx tj maxx marshalls and tjmaxxcom and homegoods segments both operate in the united states our tjx canada segment operates winners homesense and marshalls in canada and our tjx international segment operates tk maxx homesense and tkmaxxcom in europe and trade secret in australia in the us we also operate stp an offprice internet retailer with a small number of stores we currently consider all of stp including its limited number of stores as part of our ecommerce businesses the results of stp have been included in our marmaxx segment the former tjx europe segment has been renamed tjx international to reflect the acquisition of trade secret in australia we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income or loss before general corporate expense loss on early extinguishment of debt and interest expense “segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities the terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales these measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 

presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments 

us segments 

marmaxx 

 

 at january 30 2016 stp operated eight stores with selling square footage of 159000 at january 31 2015 stp operated six stores with selling square footage of 122000 at february 1 2014 stp operated four stores with selling square footage of 83000 

net sales at marmaxx increased 7 in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 the increase reflected a 3 increase from new store sales and a 4 increase from same store sales the same store sales increase of 4 in fiscal 2016 is on top of a 1 increase in the prior year same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2016 was driven by an increase in customer traffic marmaxx same store sales also reflect an increase in units sold which was more than offset by a decrease in the average ticket our merchandise mix and pricing strategy throughout fiscal 2016 resulted in the lower average ticket which we believe contributed to strong growth in customer traffic and in units sold geographically same store sales were strong throughout most of the country with the southeast region particularly strong home fashions outperformed apparel for fiscal 2016 with both categories posting same store sales growth 

same store sales for marmaxx were up 1 in fiscal 2015 on top of a 3 increase in the prior year same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase in the average transaction with a slight 

  

increase in customer traffic same store sales increases for home fashions were above the chain average while apparel overall was below the chain average within apparel jewelry and accessories and activewear were well above the average geographically same store sales increases were strongest in the southeast and southwest 

segment margin in fiscal 2016 was 143 compared to 146 in fiscal 2015 marmaxx results for fiscal 2016 reflect an increase in merchandise margin and occupancy expense leverage on same store sales growth of approximately 06 percentage points however these gains were offset by higher distribution costs reflecting the increase in units processed as well as higher store payroll primarily due to our wage initiative and processing more units at the store level in addition tjmaxxcom and stp our us ecommerce businesses had a negative impact on yearoveryear segment margin comparisons of 03 percentage points our ecommerce businesses operate at lower profit margins and at stp we incurred additional costs as we work to transition this business to be less promotional to align more closely with our offprice model and to adjust its merchandise mix overall ecommerce sales represent less than 2 of marmaxx’s net sales 

segment margin in fiscal 2015 was 146 flat compared to fiscal 2014 improvements in merchandise margin as well as a reduction in administrative costs and insurance costs as a percentage of sales were offset by the impact of our ecommerce businesses and expense deleverage primarily occupancy costs on the 1 same store sales growth 

in fiscal 2017 we expect to open approximately 60 marmaxx stores and increase selling square footage by approximately 2 

homegoods 

 

 homegoods’ net sales increased 15 in fiscal 2016 on top of a 14 increase in fiscal 2015 the increase in fiscal 2016 reflected a 7 increase from new store sales and an 8 increase from same store sales the same store sales increase of 8 in fiscal 2016 is on top of a same store sales increase of 7 in fiscal 2015 the increase in same store sales for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic same store sales growth in fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase in the value of the average transaction along with an increase in customer traffic 

segment profit margin for fiscal 2016 was 140 up from 136 for fiscal 2015 the growth in segment margin for fiscal 2016 was driven by expense leverage primarily buying and occupancy costs on strong same store sales growth and an increase in merchandise margin partially offset by an increase in distribution costs and higher payroll costs related to our wage initiative segment profit margin for fiscal 2015 was 136 up from 129 for fiscal 2014 the increase in fiscal 2015 was driven by expense leverage on the 7 same store sales increase due to buying and occupancy costs as well as administrative costs and an increase in merchandise margins 

in fiscal 2017 we plan an increase of approximately 50 homegoods stores and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 8 

  

foreign segments 

tjx canada 

 

 net sales for tjx canada in fiscal 2016 were down 1 compared to fiscal 2015 while net sales reflected a 3 increase from new store sales and a 12 increase from same store sales these were more than offset by currency translation that negatively impacted sales growth by 16 the same store sales increase of 12 in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic same store sales increased 3 in fiscal 2015 net sales for tjx canada were essentially flat in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 as a 4 increase from new store sales and a 3 increase in same store sales were completely offset by a 7 negative impact from foreign currency 

segment profit margin decreased 05 percentage points to 131 in fiscal 2016 the decrease in segment margin was primarily due to a decrease in merchandise margins the unfavorable impact of marktomarket adjustments on inventoryrelated derivatives and an increase in incentive pay due to the aboveplan performance collectively these items reduced segment margin by 12 percentage points the decrease in merchandise margin was driven by transactional foreign exchange as the yearoveryear changes in currency exchange rates increased tjx canada’s cost of merchandise purchased in us dollars these declines in the segment margin were partially offset by expense leverage on same store sales particularly buying and occupancy costs 

segment profit margin decreased 05 percentage points to 136 in fiscal 2015 the decrease in segment margin was due to a decrease in merchandise margins and the unfavorable impact of marktomarket adjustments on inventoryrelated derivatives which collectively reduced segment margin by 08 percentage points the decline in merchandise margin in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was also largely related to transactional foreign exchange the decline in the fiscal 2015 segment margin was partially offset by expense leverage on same store sales particularly buying and occupancy costs along with a reduction in advertising costs as a percentage of sales 

in fiscal 2017 we plan an increase of approximately 30 stores in canada and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 7 

  

tjx international 

 

 net sales for tjx international increased 3 in fiscal 2016 to 42 billion compared to 41 billion in fiscal 2015 on top of a 13 increase in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 the increase in fiscal 2016 reflected a 9 increase from new store sales and a 4 increase from same store sales offset by the unfavorable impact from currency translation of 10 the increase in same store sales for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by an increase in customer traffic net sales for tjx international increased 13 in fiscal 2015 to 41 billion compared to 36 billion in fiscal 2014 the increase in fiscal 2015 reflected an 8 increase from new store sales a 3 increase from same store sales and a 2 favorable impact from foreign currency translation 

segment profit margin decreased 07 percentage points to 75 in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 the fiscal 2016 segment margin was favorably impacted by strong buying and occupancy expense leverage on the strong same stores sales increase which was more than offset by the impact of several of our investment initiatives and a decrease in merchandise margin the investment initiatives include costs associated with centralizing support areas of our business investing in our infrastructure to support our growth plans our new store openings in austria and the netherlands and the acquisition of trade secret in australia 

segment profit margin increased 06 percentage points to 82 in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 the improvement in segment margin was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margins and expense leverage on same store sales particularly buying and occupancy costs the marktomarket adjustment on inventoryrelated derivatives also had a positive impact these margin improvements were partially offset by an increase in store payroll costs as a percentage of sales as well as investments in talent and research to open stores in two new countries in fiscal 2016 

we expect to add approximately 50 stores to tjx international in fiscal 2017 and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 8 

general corporate expense 

 

 general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments virtually all general corporate expenses are included in selling general and administrative expenses increased contributions to the tjx charitable foundations higher incentive 

  

compensation accruals due to our aboveplan performance and costs related to the acquisition of trade secret in australia accounted for approximately 61 million of the increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 

general corporate expense for fiscal 2015 decreased slightly from the prior year primarily due to a favorable adjustment to our reserve for former operations as well as costs incurred in fiscal 2014 relating to our home office relocations these reductions in general corporate expense were partially offset by an increase in stock compensation expense and higher contributions to the tjx foundation 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 2937 million in fiscal 2016 3008 million in fiscal 2015 and 2600 million in fiscal 2014 the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2016 decreased by 71 million compared to fiscal 2015 net income plus the noncash impact of depreciation provided cash of 2894 million in fiscal 2016 compared to 2804 million in fiscal 2015 an increase of 90 million the change in the deferred income tax provision unfavorably impacted yearoveryear cash flows by 71 million which was driven by the deferred tax impact of the higher contributions to the pension plan in fiscal 2015 the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of 290 million in fiscal 2016 compared to a use of cash of 47 million in fiscal 2015 negatively impacting yearoveryear cash flows by 243 million the cash flow impact of the change in inventory and accounts payable was primarily due to an increase in packaway inventory at the end of fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year as well as the impact of merchandise received late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 that was paid for in fiscal 2016 the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash flows by 353 million in fiscal 2016 versus a favorable impact of 166 million in fiscal 2015 this favorable impact of 187 million in yearoveryear cash flows from operations was driven primarily by an additional 100 million of voluntary contributions to our qualified pension plan in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2016 lastly fiscal 2016 cash flow from operations was reduced by 23 million for the cost to acquire favorable lease rights 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2015 increased 408 million compared to fiscal 2014 net income plus the noncash impact of depreciation provided cash of 2804 million in fiscal 2015 compared to 2686 million in fiscal 2014 an increase of 118 million the change in the deferred income tax provision which was driven by the tax treatment of the voluntary contributions to our funded pension plan of 150 million in fiscal 2015 favorably impacted fiscal 2015 operating cash flows by 50 million the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of 47 million in fiscal 2015 compared to a use of cash of 117 million in fiscal 2014 favorably impacting yearoveryear cash flows by 70 million the cash flow impact of the change in inventory and accounts payable was driven by the timing of receipt and payment of merchandise purchases the improvement in operating cash flows in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 reflects an increase in the receipt of merchandise later in the fourth quarter that was paid for in the following fiscal year the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash flows by 21 million in fiscal 2015 versus an unfavorable impact of 30 million in fiscal 2014 this favorable impact of 51 million in yearoveryear cash flows from operations was driven by a payment in fiscal 2015 of approximately 80 million for settlements with tax authorities reducing our fiscal 2014 reserve for uncertain tax positions additionally operating cash flows increased by 122 million yearoveryear due to the change in income taxes payable and recoverable which was largely driven by the increase in the current tax provision 

  

investing activities our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below 

 

 we expect our capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 will be approximately 11 billion including approximately 600 million for our offices and distribution centers including buying and merchandising systems and information systems to support growth approximately 300 million for store renovations and approximately 200 million for new stores we plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds 

in fiscal 2016 we purchased 798 million of investments compared to 431 million in fiscal 2015 additionally 681 million of investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2016 compared to 388 million in the prior year the increased investment activity in fiscal 2016 reflects the impact of changing the investments of our executive savings plan this change in investments resulted in 154 million of assets being liquidated and then reinvested in new investment options the balance of this activity primarily relates to shortterm investments which had initial maturities in excess of 90 days and per our policy are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented finally investing activities include the initial payment of 57 million for the acquisition of trade secret 

financing activities cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 2176 million in fiscal 2016 1560 million in fiscal 2015 and 1144 million in fiscal 2014 

tjx repurchased and retired 265 million shares of its common stock at a cost of 18 billion during fiscal 2016 on a “trade date basis” tjx reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis under our stock repurchase programs we spent 18 billion to repurchase 266 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2016 17 billion to repurchase 276 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2015 and 15 billion to repurchase 273 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2014 see note d to the consolidated financial statements for more information in february 2016 we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional 20 billion of tjx stock we currently plan to repurchase approximately 15 billion to 20 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2017 we determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow liquidity economic and market conditions our assessment of prospects for our business legal requirements and other factors the timing and amount of these purchases may change 

we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 084 per share in fiscal 2016 070 per share in fiscal 2015 and 058 per share in fiscal 2014 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 544 million in fiscal 2016 466 million in fiscal 2015 and 394 million in fiscal 2014 we also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 132 million in fiscal 2016 143 million in fiscal 2015 and 146 million in fiscal 2014 we expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2017 of 026 per share or an annual dividend of 104 per share subject to the declaration and approval of our board of directors this would represent a 24 increase over the per share dividends declared and paid for fiscal 2016 

in june 2014 we issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of 275 sevenyear notes generating proceeds net of debt issuance expenses and fees of 743 million in july 2014 we used a portion of the proceeds from the 275 sevenyear notes to redeem the 400 million aggregate principal amount of 420 notes paying 416 million to the note holders for the present value of principal and future remaining interest payments due on the notes in fiscal 2014 we issued 500 million of 250 tenyear notes generating proceeds net of debt issuance expenses and fees of 495 million see note j to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

we traditionally have funded our working capital requirements including for seasonal merchandise primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented as needed by shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper as of january 30 2016 our cash and cash equivalents held outside the us were 12 billion of which 3554 million was held in countries where we have the intention to reinvest any undistributed earnings indefinitely we have provided for deferred us taxes on all undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries in canada puerto rico italy india and hong kong if we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries we would not expect to incur additional tax expense but our cash would be reduced by the amount of taxes paid for all other foreign subsidiaries no income taxes have been provided on the undistributed earnings because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the business we have no current plans to repatriate cash balances held by such foreign subsidiaries we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents internally generated funds and our credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year our credit facilities were amended subsequent to the fiscal year end and are more fully described in note j to the consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations as of january 30 2016 we had known contractual obligations including current installments under longterm debt arrangements operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows in thousands 

 

  

  

  

 we also have longterm liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include 4182 million for employee compensation and benefits and 334 million for uncertain tax positions 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to the areas described below 

inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except stp and trade secret the businesses that utilize the retail method have some inventory that is initially valued at cost before the retail method is applied as it has not been fully processed for sale ie inventory in transit and unprocessed inventory in our distribution centers under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced typically a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns however as a normal business practice we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but we take a full physical inventory near the 

  

fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end historically the variance between estimated shrinkage and actual shrinkage has not been material to our annual financial results we do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and tradenames we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets goodwill and tradenames at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores as well as of our business units which involve a number of factors including historical trends recent performance and general economic assumptions if we determine that an impairment of longlived assets has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets 

retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates we are required to make economic demographic and other assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations the longterm rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets and assumptions about mortality all of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period these assumptions including the discount rate which we determine annually based on market interest rates and our estimated longterm rate of return which can differ considerably from actual returns can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan if our discount rate decreased 025 percentage points our fiscal 2016 pension cost for our funded plan would have increased by approximately 8 million similarly an increase in the discount of rate of 025 percentage points would result in a comparable reduction of pension cost a change of 025 percentage points in our longterm rate of return would increase or decrease our fiscal 2016 pension cost by approximately 3 million during fiscal 2015 we adjusted our assumptions relating to mortality the expected lives of our pension participants in light of new mortality tables issued by the society of actuaries which project longer life expectancies the change in our mortality assumptions added 59 million to the projected benefit obligation for the funded plan as of january 31 2015 and added approximately 7 million to our fiscal 2016 pension cost when the discount rate market performance of our plan assets changes in laws regulations actuarial standards or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan our required contributions may increase we also consider these factors in determining the amount of voluntary contributions we may make to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements in fiscal 2016 we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of 50 million 

sharebased compensation in accordance with gaap we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan the fair value of the awards is amortized as “sharebased compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service we use the blackscholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results the use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost a 5 increase in expected volatility would increase the peroption value of our most recent option award by 4 while a decrease of the same amount would decrease the peroption value of our most recent option award by 5 

casualty insurance our casualty insurance program is a selfinsured program which requires us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost the estimated claims are developed with the assistance of an actuary based on historical experience and other factors these estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates if our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance for fiscal 2016 were to change by 5 the fiscal 2016 pretax cost would increase or decrease by approximately 4 million a large portion of these claims is funded with a nonrefundable payment during the policy year offsetting our estimated claims accrual we had a net accrual of 197 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of january 30 2016 

  

reserves for uncertain tax positions like many large corporations our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation assessment examination litigation and settlement the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain in accordance with gaap we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the positions we have taken will not be sustained however in the next twelve months and in future periods the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay as the result of the final resolutions of examinations judicial or administrative proceedings changes in facts law or legal interpretations expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of or changes in tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

loss contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our management with the assistance of our legal counsel assesses such contingent liabilities such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable

in addition to our four major divisions we operate sierra trading post acquired in 2012 a leading offprice internet retailer of brand name and quality outdoor gear family apparel and footwear sporting goods and home fashions sierra trading post launched its ecommerce site sierratradingpostcom in 1998 and operates six retail stores in the us 

flexible business model our flexible offprice business model including our opportunistic buying inventory management logistics and store layouts is designed to deliver our customers a compelling value proposition of fashionable quality brand name and designer merchandise at excellent values our buying and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than traditional retailers and the design and operation of our stores and distribution centers support this flexibility our merchants have more visibility into consumer fashion and market trends and pricing when we buy closer to need which can help us “buy smarter” and reduce our markdown exposure our selling floor space is flexible without walls between departments and largely free of permanent fixtures so we can easily expand and contract departments to accommodate the merchandise we purchase our logistics and distribution operations are designed to support our buying strategies and to facilitate quick efficient and differentiated delivery of merchandise to our stores with a goal of getting the right merchandise to the right stores at the right times 

opportunistic buying as an offprice retailer our buying practices which we refer to as opportunistic buying differentiate us from traditional retailers our overall buying strategy is to acquire merchandise on an ongoing basis that will enable us to offer a desirable and rapidly changing mix of branded designer and other quality merchandise in our stores at prices below regular prices for comparable merchandise at department and specialty stores we seek out and select merchandise from the broad range of opportunities in the marketplace to achieve this end our buying organization which numbers more than 1000 associates in 13 buying offices in ten countries executes this opportunistic buying strategy in a variety of ways depending on market conditions and other factors 

we take advantage of opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from the production and flow of inventory in the apparel and home fashions marketplace which include among others order cancellations manufacturer overruns closeouts and special production direct from brands and factories our buying strategies are intentionally flexible to allow us to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market and to adjust how and what we source as well as when we source it our goal is to operate with lean inventory levels compared to conventional retailers to give us the flexibility to seek out and to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise in contrast to traditional retailers which tend to order most of their goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor our merchants remain in the marketplace throughout the year frequently looking for opportunities to buy merchandise we buy much of our merchandise for the current or immediately upcoming selling season we also buy some merchandise that is available in the market with the intention of storing it for sale typically in future selling seasons we generally make these purchases referred to as packaway in response to opportunities in the marketplace to buy merchandise that we believe has the right combination of brand fashion price and quality to supplement the product we expect to be available to purchase later for those future seasons we also acquire some merchandise that we offer under inhouse brands or brands that are licensed to us we develop some of this merchandise ourselves in order to supplement the depth of or fill gaps in our expected merchandise assortment 

our expansive vendor universe which is in excess of 17000 consists primarily of manufacturers along with retailers and other vendors and provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise we have not 

  

experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quality merchandise for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments and expect this will continue as we continue to grow we believe a number of factors provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise and make us an attractive channel for many vendors in the market we are typically willing to purchase lessthanfull assortments of items styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large we are able to disperse merchandise across our geographically diverse network of stores and to target specific markets we pay promptly we generally do not ask for typical retail concessions such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries or return privileges and we have financial strength and an excellent credit rating 

inventory management we offer our customers a rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a treasure hunt experience in our stores and to spur frequent customer visits to achieve this we seek to turn the inventory in our stores rapidly regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions at excellent values our specialized inventory planning purchasing monitoring and markdown systems coupled with distribution center storage processing handling and shipping systems enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local preferences and demographics achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of products and generally sell within the period we planned we make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations centrally using information provided by specialized computer systems designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner over the past several years we have been investing in our supply chain with the goal of continuing to operate with low inventory levels to ship more efficiently and quickly and to more precisely and effectively allocate merchandise to each store 

pricing our mission is to offer brand name and designer fashionable quality merchandise in our stores with retail prices that are generally 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular retail prices on comparable merchandise every day we do not generally engage in promotional pricing activity such as sales or coupons we have generally been able to react to price fluctuations in the wholesale market to maintain our pricing gap relative to prices offered by traditional retailers as well as our merchandise margins through various economic cycles 

low cost operations we operate with a low cost structure compared to many traditional retailers we focus aggressively on expenses throughout our business our advertising is generally focused on promoting our retail banners rather than individual products including at times promoting multiple banners together which contributes to our advertising budget as a percentage of sales remaining low compared to many traditional retailers we design our stores to provide a pleasant convenient shopping environment but relative to other retailers do not spend heavily on store fixtures additionally our distribution network is designed to run cost effectively 

customer serviceshopping experience we continue to renovate and upgrade our stores across our retail banners to enhance our customers’ shopping experience and help drive sales although we offer a selfservice format we train our store associates to provide friendly and helpful customer service and seek to staff our stores to deliver a positive shopping experience we typically offer customerfriendly return policies we accept a variety of payment methods including cash credit cards and debit cards and offer tjxbranded credit cards in the us through a bank but do not own the customer receivables 

distribution we operate distribution centers encompassing approximately 13 million square feet in five countries these centers are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model we ship substantially all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers as well as warehouses and shipping centers operated by third parties we shipped approximately 21 billion units to our stores during fiscal 2015

 item 1a risk factors tableend the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks that follow individually or in the aggregate are those that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements 

failure to execute our opportunistic buying strategy and inventory management could adversely affect our business 

while opportunistic buying operating with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are key elements of our offprice business strategy they subject us to risks related to the pricing quantity mix nature and timing of inventory flowing to our stores our merchants are in the marketplace frequently as much of our merchandise is purchased for the current or immediately upcoming season and our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion with them our business model expects them to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market assess the desirability and value of merchandise and generally make determinations of how and what we source as well as when we source it if we do not obtain the right fresh desirable merchandise at the right times quantities and prices it could adversely affect customer traffic as well as our sales and margins 

we base our purchases of inventory in part on our sales forecasts if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory leading to decreased profit margins or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales either of which could adversely affect our financial performance 

if we are unable to generally purchase inventory at prices sufficiently below prices paid by conventional retailers we may not be able to maintain an overall pricing differential to regular department and specialty stores and our ability to attract customers and sustain our margins may be adversely affected we may not achieve this at various times or in some divisions or geographies which could adversely affect our results 

we must also properly execute our inventory management strategy of delivering the right product to the right stores at the right time we need to appropriately allocate merchandise among our stores timely and efficiently distribute inventory to stores maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store appropriately change the allocation of floor space of stores among product categories to respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns if we are not able to do so our ability to attract and retain customers and our results could be adversely affected 

in addition to our own execution we may need to react to factors affecting inventory flow that are outside our control discussed further below such as adverse weather and natural disasters or other changes in conditions affecting our vendors and others in our supply chain such as political instability labor issues including strikes or threats of strikes or increasing cost of regulations if we are not able to adjust appropriately to such factors our inventory management may be affected which could impact our performance and our relationship with our customers 

failure to continue to expand our business and operations successfully or to manage our substantial size and scale effectively could adversely affect our financial results 

our growth strategy includes successfully expanding our offprice model within our current markets and into new geographic regions product lines businesses and channels and as appropriate adding new businesses whether by 

  

development investment or acquisition there are significant risks associated with our ability to continue to successfully extend our current business and to enter new businesses including managing the implementation of this growth effectively if any aspect of our expansion strategy does not achieve the success we expect in whole or in part we may be required to increase our investment slow our planned growth or close stores or operations which could adversely affect our financial performance for example successful store growth requires us to find and lease appropriate real estate on attractive terms in each of the locations where we seek to open stores our ability to do so depends among other things on availability and selection of appropriate sites in appropriate geographies degree of competition for sites factors affecting costs such as real estate construction and development costs and costs and availability of capital and variations in or changes to zoning or other land use regulations if we cannot lease appropriate sites on attractive terms it could limit our ability to successfully grow in various markets or adversely affect the economics of new stores in various markets if and when we enter new markets we also may encounter difficulties in attracting customers as discussed further below in the risk factor regarding customer trends and preferences new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect our sales and profitability 

further our substantial size imposes demands on maintaining appropriate internal resources and third party providers to support our business effectively these demands may increase as we grow our business adding pressure to management and various functions across our business including administration merchandising store operations distribution and compliance and on appropriately staffing and training personnel in these areas as we grow the large size and scale of our operations our multiple chains in the us canada and europe and the autonomy afforded to the chains in some aspects of the business increase the risk that our systems and practices will not be implemented appropriately throughout our company and that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations which risks may increase as we continue to grow particularly as we expand into additional countries if business information is not shared effectively or if we are otherwise unable to manage our size or growth effectively we may operate with decreased operational efficiency may need to reduce our rate of expansion of one or more operations or otherwise curtail growth in one or more markets which may adversely affect our success in executing our business goals and adversely impact our sales and results 

failure to identify customer trends and preferences to meet customer demand in new or existing markets or channels could negatively impact our performance 

because our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand we work to identify customer trends and preferences on an ongoing basis and to offer inventory that meets those trends and preferences however doing so across our diverse merchandise categories and in the many markets in the us canada and europe in which we do business on a timely basis is challenging trends and preferences in new markets may differ from what we anticipate although our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer preferences and trends and to expand and contract merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes we may not successfully do so which could add difficulty in attracting new customers retaining existing customers encouraging frequent visits and adversely affect our results customers may also have expectations about how they shop in stores or through ecommerce or more generally engage with businesses across different channels or media through internetbased and other digital or mobile channels or particular forms of social media which may vary across demographics and may evolve rapidly meeting demand effectively involves identifying the right opportunities and making the right investments at the right time and with the right speed among other things and failure to do so may impact our reputation and our financial results 

if we fail to successfully implement our marketing advertising and promotional programs or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising marketing and promotional activities the name recognition and reputation of our chains and the location of and service offered in our stores although we use marketing advertising and promotional programs to attract customers to our 

  

stores through various media including television social media database marketing print and direct marketing and through our loyalty programs some of our competitors expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage our programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations we may need to adjust these programs more quickly or have more difficulty making them effective as internetbased and other digital or mobile communication channels and other social media rapidly evolve and we may not successfully do so 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive we compete with local regional national and international retailers that sell apparel home fashions and other merchandise we sell including in stores through catalogues or other media or over the internet some of our competitors are larger than we are or have more experience in selling certain product lines than we do new competitors frequently enter the market and existing competitors enter or increase their presence in the markets in which we operate expand their merchandise offerings add new sales channels or change their pricing methods all of which increase competition for customers we compete on the basis of fashion quality price value merchandise selection and freshness brand name recognition customer service reputation and store location our competitiveness is highly dependent on our effective execution of our offprice model of offering our customers a fresh rapidly changing and attractive mix of merchandise delivering value if we fail to compete effectively our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 

failure to attract train and retain quality associates in appropriate numbers including key associates and management could adversely affect our performance 

our performance depends on recruiting developing training and retaining quality sales systems distribution center and other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel many of our associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover availability and skill of associates may differ across markets in which we do business and in new markets we enter and we need to manage our labor needs effectively we also need to effectively control labor costs discussed further below in the risk factor regarding labor costs in addition because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must provide significant internal training and development for key associates across the company including within our buying organization similar to other retailers we face challenges in securing and retaining sufficient talent in management and other key areas for many reasons including competition in the retail industry generally and for talent in various geographic markets if we do not continue to attract qualified individuals train them in our business model support their development and retain them our performance could be adversely affected or our growth could be limited 

labor costs including pension and healthcare costs and other challenges from our large workforce may adversely affect our results and profitability 

we have a large workforce and our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs including costs of providing retirement health and other employee benefits is subject to various factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates and minimum wage requirements participant benefit levels changing demographics economic conditions interest rate changes economic demographic and other actuarial assumptions health and other insurance costs and the regulatory environment including health care legislation immigration law and governmental labor and employment and employee benefits programs and requirements certain associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions of various kinds as well as risks and potential expenses associated with multiemployer plans including from potential withdrawal liability and potential insolvency of other participating employers other associates are members of works councils which may subject us to additional actions or expense in addition any failure of third parties that perform services on our behalf to comply with immigration employment or other laws and regulations could damage our reputation or disrupt our ability to obtain needed labor when wage rates or benefit levels increase in a market increasing our wages or benefits may cause our earnings to decrease while failing to increase our wages or benefits competitively or reducing our wages or benefits could result in a 

  

decline in our ability to attract or retain associates or in the quality of our workforce causing our customer service or performance to suffer which could impact our results 

economic conditions on a global level or in particular markets may adversely affect our financial performance 

global financial markets can experience extreme volatility disruption and credit contraction which adversely affect global economic conditions turmoil in the financial and credit markets or other changes in economic conditions could adversely affect sources of liquidity available to us or our costs of capital and could adversely affect plan asset values and investment performance and increase our pension liabilities expenses and funding requirements with respect to companysponsored and multiemployer pension plans economic conditions both on a global level and in particular markets including unemployment decreased disposable income and actual and perceived wealth energy and health care costs interest and tax rates and policies weakness in the housing market volatility in capital markets decreased credit availability inflation and deflation as well as political or other factors beyond our control such as threats or possibilities of war terrorism global or national unrest actual or threatened epidemics and political instability may also have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending consumer spending in turn affects retail sales these conditions and factors could adversely affect discretionary consumer spending and although we believe our flexible offprice model helps us react they may adversely affect our sales cash flows and results of operations and performance 

compromises of our data security could materially harm our reputation and business 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect store process and transmit certain information from individuals such as our customers and associates including for example customer payment card and check information we rely in part on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of personal andor confidential information as with many other companies particularly in the retail industry we may be subject to attempts to compromise our data security computer hackers may for example attempt to penetrate our computer systems or those of the third parties with whom we work or to whom we outsource business operations and if successful misappropriate customer or associate information or confidential business information of our company we suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions into portions of our computer system that process and store information related to customer transactions discovered late in 2006 in which we believe customer data were stolen we have taken steps designed to further strengthen the security of our computer system and protocols and have instituted an ongoing program with respect to data security consistent with a consent order with the federal trade commission to assess the ongoing effectiveness of our information security program and to maintain and enhance our program as appropriate nevertheless there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a future data compromise that unauthorized parties will not gain access to the information that we collect store process or transmit or that any such data compromise or access will be discovered in a timely way in addition an associate contractor or third party with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations may fail to monitor the systems effectively or one of those parties may misuse the personal or confidential information to which they have access may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to access or misappropriate such types of information or may purposefully or through error inadvertently cause a breach involving such information advances in computer and software technology and capabilities rapid changes in the sources methods and targets of cyberattacks and other developments including the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals generally may increase the risk of such a breach 

compromise of our data security or that of third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business information and delays in detecting any such compromise or loss could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and customers’ willingness to shop in our stores impact our ability to attract and retain customers violate applicable laws regulations orders and agreements and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material 

  

failure to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information systems including data centers hardware and software and applications to manage many aspects of our business including to process and record transactions in our stores to enable effective communication systems to plan and track inventory flow to manage logistics and to generate performance and financial reports we are dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems supporting these systems requires a number of resources including effective and qualified internal teams as we grow and as our systems evolve we must continue to hire train manage and retain these teams in an effective way our computer systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are also subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes including power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses or malware security breaches cyberattacks catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and design or usage errors by our associates or contractors although we seek to maintain our systems effectively manage our team of internal and third party resources effectively and successfully address the risk of compromises of the integrity security and consistent operations of our systems we may not be successful in doing so compromises interruptions or shutdowns of our systems including those managed by third parties whether intentional or inadvertent could lead to delays in our business operations and if significant or extreme affect our results of operations 

we modify update and replace our systems and infrastructure from time to time including by adding new hardware software and applications maintaining updating or replacing legacy programs converting to global systems integrating new service providers and adding enhanced or new functionality such as for cloud computing technologies and for the continued operation and development of our ecommerce businesses and adding new systems when we acquire new businesses we also modify and change our procedures for and add and change vendors and internal teams who assist us with designing implementing and maintaining our systems although we believe we are diligent in selecting systems and vendors and implementing procedures to enable us to maintain the integrity of our systems when we modify them there are inherent risks associated with modifying or replacing systems with new or changed relationships and with changes from acquisitions including accurately capturing and maintaining data realizing the expected benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption of the operation of the systems and diversion to internal teams’ attention as the changes are implemented potential issues associated with implementing technology initiatives and the time and resources required to optimize the benefits of new elements of our systems and its infrastructure could reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term in addition any interruption in the operation of our websites particularly our ecommerce sites could cause us to suffer reputational harm or to lose sales if customers are unable to access our site or purchase merchandise from us during such interruption the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends upon our information systems including our ability to operate and maintain them effectively to select appropriate internal teams and vendors to maintain or enhance them and to select and implement appropriate new technologies systems controls hardware software and applications and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems and the third party systems we rely on to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm our profitability 

adverse or unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate or our distribution centers are located could adversely affect our operating results 

both adverse and unseasonable weather such as storms severe cold or heat or unseasonable temperatures affect customers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop certain categories or at all and accordingly can adversely affect the demand for the merchandise in our stores particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise weather can also affect the ability to transport merchandise to our stores from our distribution and shipping centers or elsewhere in our supply chain efficiently or in a timely way as a result adverse or unseasonable weather in our markets could adversely affect our sales increase markdowns and adversely affect our operating results 

  

our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic events 

unforeseen public health issues such as pandemics and epidemics natural or other disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other extreme weather and climate conditions or fires explosions and acts of war or terrorism in any of our markets could disrupt our operations or the operations of one or more of our vendors or of our supply chain or could severely damage or destroy one or more of our stores or distribution facilities located in the affected areas daytoday operations particularly our ability to receive products from our vendors or transport products to our stores could be adversely affected or we could be required to close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by affected distribution centers for a short or extended period of time as a result our business could be adversely affected 

as our business is subject to seasonal influences a decrease in sales or margins a severe disruption or other significant event that impacts the business could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operating results if it occurs during the second half of the year 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we generally realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the year which includes the backtoschool and yearend holiday seasons any decrease in sales or margins or any significant adverse event during this period could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations 

damage to our corporate reputation or those of our retail banners could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

we believe that building the brand reputation of our retail banners is important to our continuing success and we work to build relationships with our customers through traditional and social media and other advertising and promotional activities these relationships and our reputation is based in part on perceptions of subjective qualities so incidents involving us merchandise that we carry or our industry more generally that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business particularly if the incidents result in rapid or significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry similarly information about us our retail banners and the merchandise we sell including our licensed or owned brands publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues including blogs websites and other forums for internetbased communications that allow individuals almost immediate access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons may adversely affect our reputation and brand even if the information is unverified or inaccurate the reputation of our company and our retail banners may be damaged by adverse events at the corporate level or at our retail banners damage to the reputation of our company and our banners could result in declines in customer loyalty and sales affect our vendor relationships development opportunities and associate retention and otherwise adversely affect our business 

issues with merchandise quality or safety could damage our reputation sales and financial results 

various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we sell to consumers regulations and standards in this area including those related to the us consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 state regulations like california’s proposition 65 and similar legislation in other countries in which we operate impose restrictions and requirements on the merchandise we sell in our stores and through ecommerce these regulations change from time to time and new federal state provincial or local regulations in the us and other countries that may affect our business are contemplated and enacted with some regularity if we or our merchandise vendors are unable to comply with regulatory requirements on a timely basis or at all or to adequately monitor new regulations that may apply to existing or new merchandise categories or in new geographies significant fines or penalties could be incurred or we could have to curtail some aspects of our sales or operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results we rely on our vendors to provide quality merchandise that complies with applicable product safety laws and other applicable laws but they may not comply with their obligations to do so although our arrangements with our vendors frequently provide for indemnification for product liabilities the vendors may fail to honor those obligations to an extent we consider sufficient or at all issues with the quality and safety of merchandise particularly with food bath and body and children’s products and issues with the genuineness of 

  

merchandise or customer concerns about such issues regardless of our fault could cause damage to our reputation and could result in lost sales uninsured product liability claims or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs and regulatory civil or criminal fines or penalties any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

our expanding international operations may expose us to risks inherent in operating in new countries 

we have a significant retail presence in canada and in countries in europe and have established buying offices around the world and our goal is to continue to expand our operations into international markets in the future such as continued expansion in europe it can be costly and complex to establish develop and maintain international operations and promote business in new international jurisdictions which may differ significantly from the us and other countries in which we currently operate in addition to facing risks similar to our us and current international operations such as with regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act there are additional risks inherent in opening operations in new countries such as understanding the retail climate and trends local customs and competitive conditions complying with relevant laws rules and regulations and developing the appropriate infrastructure for local operations there are also financial risks associated with international operations including currency exchange fluctuations and adverse tax consequences or limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds outside of the country where earned which could have an adverse impact on our operations profitability or liquidity complying with applicable laws and our own internal policies may require us to spend additional time and resources to implement new procedures and financial controls conduct audits train associates and third parties on our compliance methods or take other actions which could adversely impact our operations 

we are subject to risks associated with importing merchandise from other countries 

many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a lesser extent by us in many countries outside of the country where the stores are located particularly southeastern asia where we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those imposed upon the manufacturer of such products we are subject to the various risks of importing merchandise from other countries and purchasing product made in other countries such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

these and other factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise beyond our control could affect the availability and the price of our inventory furthermore although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to operating in nonus jurisdictions and importing merchandise there can be no assurance that contractors agents vendors or other third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our reputation operations or operating results 

our results may be adversely affected by reduced availability or increases in the price of oil or other fuels raw materials and other commodities 

energy and fuel costs have fluctuated dramatically and in the past had significant cost increases particularly the price of oil and gasoline an increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers although we typically implement a hedging strategy designed to manage a portion of our transportation costs that strategy may not be effective or sufficient and increases in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs which could have an adverse effect on our performance increased regulation related to environmental costs including cap and trade or other emissions management systems could also adversely affect our costs of doing business including utility costs transportation and logistics similarly other commodity prices can fluctuate dramatically such as the cost of cotton and synthetic fabrics which at times have risen significantly such increases can increase the cost of merchandise which could adversely affect our performance through potentially reduced consumer demand or reduced margins 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and changes in currency exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into us dollars for financial reporting purposes because of this movements in currency exchange rates have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our consolidated and segment results from time to time changes in currency exchange rates can also increase the cost of inventory purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the business buying the merchandise when exchange rates change significantly in a short period as they did in fiscal 2015 it can be difficult for us to adjust retail prices accordingly and gross margin can be adversely affected in addition a significant amount of merchandise we offer for sale is made in china and accordingly a revaluation of chinese currency or increased market flexibility in the exchange rate for that currency increasing its value relative to the us dollar or currencies in which our stores are located could be significant 

additionally we routinely enter into inventoryrelated derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rates on merchandise margins of merchandise purchases by our divisions denominated in currencies other than their local currencies in accordance with gaap we evaluate the fair value of these derivative instruments and make marktomarket adjustments at the end of each accounting period these adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates as there was in fiscal 2015 and may have a significant impact on our earnings 

although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates we expect that currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations from time to time in addition fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our earnings and operating results if a counterparty to one of our hedging arrangements fails to perform 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate and may fall short of prior periods our projections or the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past and they may do so in the future if we fail to increase our results over prior periods to achieve our projected results or to meet the 

  

expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline and the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance results may be affected by various factors including those described in these risk factors most of our operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not vary directly with the amount of our sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term as a result if sales in a particular quarter are below our expectations for that quarter we generally are not able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter resulting in a disproportionate effect on our net income for the quarter we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to project sales and align expenses if we do not control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results or if actual results differ significantly from our forecast our financial performance could be adversely affected in addition if we do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplated pursuant to our stock repurchase programs our earnings per share may be adversely affected 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions or investments in new businesses or divest close or consolidate any of our current businesses our business will be subject to additional risks 

we may acquire new businesses invest in or enter into joint ventures with other businesses develop new businesses internally and divest close or consolidate businesses acquisition investment or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses and we may not effectively evaluate target companies or investments or assess the risks benefits and cost of buying investing in or closing businesses or of the integration of acquired businesses all of which can be difficult timeconsuming and dilutive acquisitions and investments may not meet our performance and other expectations and acquisition investments closings and divestitures may expose us to unexpected or greaterthanexpected costs liabilities and risks divestitures closings and consolidations also involve risks such as significant costs and obligations of closure including exposure on leases owned real estate and other contractual employment pension and severance obligations and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer failure to execute on mergers acquisitions investments divestitures closings and consolidations in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 

failure to comply with existing laws regulations and orders or changes in existing laws and regulations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

we are subject to federal state provincial regional and local laws rules and regulations in the united states and other countries any of which may change from time to time as well as orders and assurances these legal regulatory and administrative requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business from the cost of providing health care and retirement benefits workforce management logistics marketing importexport sourcing and manufacturing data protection and others if we fail to comply with these laws rules regulations and orders we may be subject to judgments fines or other costs or penalties which could materially adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition further applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time and the changes could have material effects on our reported financial results and condition 

we must also comply with new and changing laws and regulations new regulatory initiatives evolving interpretation of existing laws by judicial and regulatory authorities and reforms in jurisdictions where we do business these changes could increase our costs of compliance or of doing business and could adversely affect our operating results including those involving 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 our results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation legal proceedings and other legal matters 

we are involved or may in the future become involved in legal proceedings regulatory reviews audits and other legal matters these may involve inquiries investigations lawsuits and other proceedings by local provincial state and federal governmental entities in the united states and other countries and private plaintiffs including with respect to tax escheat whistleblower claims employment and employee benefits including classification employment rights discrimination wage and hour and retaliation securities disclosure real estate tort consumer protection privacy product safety advertising and intellectual property there continue to be a number of employmentrelated lawsuits including putative class actions in the united states and we are subject to these types of suits we cannot predict the results of legal and regulatory proceedings with certainty and actual results may differ from any reserves we establish estimating the probable outcome regardless of merit or outcome litigation can be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expense and diversion of management attention legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations could expose us to significant defense costs fines penalties and liability to private parties and governmental entities for monetary recoveries and other amounts and attorneys’ fees andor require us to change aspects of our operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including the results of tax audits and examinations income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory income tax rates changes in income tax rates changes in transfer pricing changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in applicable tax legislation regulations and treaties exposure to additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision and accruals for taxes and actual results may differ from our estimations 

in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state provincial and local tax authorities in the us and foreign countries and the examining authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various proceedings which are at various stages with such authorities with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these proceedings to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of our provision for income taxes and increase and decrease our provision as a result of these assessments however the developments in and actual results of proceedings or the result of rulings by or settlements with tax authorities and courts or due to changes in facts law or legal interpretations expiration of applicable statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions could differ from the amounts we have accrued for such proceedings in either a positive or a negative manner which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations in addition we are subject to tax audits and examinations for payroll value added salesbased and other taxes relating to our businesses 

our real estate leases generally obligate us for long periods which subjects us to financial risks 

we lease virtually all of our store locations generally for an initial term of ten years with options to renew the term and either own or lease for long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices accordingly we are subject to the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate which can adversely affect our results as for example was the case in the closures of various of our former operations while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions including by making specified payments we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so if we decide to close stores we are generally required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases which generally include among other things paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or 

  

paying to exercise rights to terminate and the performance of any of these obligations may be expensive when we assign leases or sublease space to third parties we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform in addition when the lease term for the stores in our ongoing operations expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close stores or to relocate stores within a market on less favorable terms 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our operations growth stock repurchases and dividends and interest and debt repayment 

our business depends upon our operations to continue to generate strong cash flow to supply capital to support our general operating activities to fund our growth and our return of cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase programs and dividends and to pay our interest and debt repayments our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or to repatriate cash from our international operations in a manner that is cost effective could adversely affect our growth plans and financial performance including our earnings per share we borrow on occasion to finance our activities and if financing were not available to us in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed it could also adversely affect our financial performance

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the discussion that follows relates to our 52week fiscal years ended january 31 2015 fiscal 2015 and february 1 2014 fiscal 2014 and our 53week fiscal year ended february 2 2013 fiscal 2013 

overview 

we are the leading offprice apparel and home fashions retailer in the us and worldwide we sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices on comparable merchandise every day we operate over 3300 stores through our four main segments in the us marmaxx which operates tj maxx marshalls and tjmaxxcom and homegoods tjx canada which operates winners homesense and marshalls in canada and tjx europe which operates tk maxx homesense and tkmaxxcom in europe we also operate sierra trading post stp a leading offprice internet retailer that we acquired in late fiscal 2013 which operates sierratradingpostcom and six stores in the us the results of stp have been reported with the marmaxx segment 

fiscal 2015 was another successful year for tjx as we posted solid gains in net sales and earnings per share on top of strong increases in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 we continued to generate strong cash flows allowing us to return value to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases while continuing to reinvest in our business by adding new stores remodeling existing ones and strengthening our infrastructure to support our next level of growth in fiscal 2016 we announced an initiative to raise wages for our us full and parttime hourly store associates to at least 900 per hour beginning in june 2015 

highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2015 include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results followed by a discussion of our segment operating results 

net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal 2015 totaled 291 billion a 6 increase over 274 billion in fiscal 2014 the increase reflected a 4 increase from new stores and a 2 increase from same store sales foreign currency exchange rates and ecommerce sales had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2015 net sales growth consolidated net sales for fiscal 2014 totaled 274 billion a 6 increase over 259 billion in fiscal 2013 the increase reflected a 4 increase from new stores a 3 increase from same store sales and a 1 increase from stp offset by a 2 decrease attributable to the 53 rd week included in fiscal 2013 foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2014 net sales 

same store sales increases in the us for fiscal 2015 were driven by increases in the value of the average transaction and customer traffic in fiscal 2015 within apparel sales from jewelry and accessories and activewear performed particularly well as did home fashions geographically in the us sales were strongest in the southeast and southwest same store sales increases at tjx europe and tjx canada were above the consolidated average 

same store sales increases in the us for fiscal 2014 were driven by an increase in average ticket as well as a slight increase in customer traffic we believe unfavorable weather in many regions where we operate had a negative impact on sales during the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014 sales from jewelry and accessories and home fashions performed particularly well in fiscal 2014 geographically same store sales increases in the us were strongest in the west coast and florida same store sales increases at tjx europe were above the consolidated average while tjx canada was below the consolidated average 

we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation the sales of sierra trading post tjmaxxcom and tkmaxxcom are not included in same store sales we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated on a constant currency basis meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance we define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the same store sales calculation and define average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold we define average transaction or average basket to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the same store sales calculation 

  

the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales 

 

  

 impact of foreign currency exchange rates  our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows 

 

  

 we discuss the effect of these foreign currency issues on our actual results throughout this discussion as a result of the strengthening of the us dollar and resulting change in foreign currency exchange rates in late fiscal 2015 if rates were to stay at or near those levels in the coming year we expect fiscal 2016 results would be negatively impacted to a much greater extent than historically experienced 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales remained flat at 715 in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 and was 716 in fiscal 2013 there was a slight increase in merchandise margins in fiscal 2015 

the 53 rd week in fiscal 2013 which benefitted that year’s expense ratio by approximately 02 percentage points impacts yearoveryear comparisons the 01 percentage point improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to slight expense leverage in buying and occupancy costs as merchandise margins were comparable to the prior year 

  

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 161 in fiscal 2015 163 in fiscal 2014 and 164 in fiscal 2013 the reduction in this ratio is largely due to a reduction in our reserves for former operations in fiscal 2015 as well as costs incurred in fiscal 2014 relating to our home office relocations 

the improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to yearoveryear favorability from a combination of items that negatively impacted the fiscal 2013 expense ratio fiscal 2013 included a noncash charge for the cumulative impact of a correction to our pension accrual a nonoperating charge due to the adjustment in our reserve for former operations relating to closed stores and contributions to the tjx foundation 

loss on early extinguishment of debt on july 8 2014 we redeemed our 400 million aggregate principal amount of 420 notes due august 2015 and recorded a pretax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of 168 million 

interest expense net the components of interest expense net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

 

 the increase in net interest expense for fiscal 2015 reflected the interest cost from the date of issuance june 5 2014 on the 750 million 275 sevenyear notes in addition fiscal 2015 included 12 months of interest expense on the 500 million 250 tenyear notes compared to fiscal 2014 which only reflected nine months of interest expense these costs were partially offset by interest savings due to the redemption of the 400 million 420 notes the reduction in capitalized interest on ongoing capital projects is partially offset by an increase in interest income driven by higher cash balances 

income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was 376 in fiscal 2015 356 in fiscal 2014 and 380 in fiscal 2013 the increase in the fiscal 2015 effective income tax rate as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily due to the impact on the fiscal 2014 income tax rate from tax benefits in fiscal 2014 of approximately 80 million which were primarily due to a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with state taxing authorities and the reversal of valuation allowances against foreign net operating loss carryforwards these benefits reduced the fiscal 2014 effective income tax rate by 14 percentage points and 08 percentage points respectively the decrease in the fiscal 2014 effective income tax rate as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the tax benefits described above see note l to the consolidated financial statements for more information relating to income taxes 

net income and diluted earnings per share net income was 22 billion in fiscal 2015 a 4 increase over 21 billion in fiscal 2014 which in turn was a 12 increase over 19 billion in fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share were 315 in fiscal 2015 294 in fiscal 2014 and 255 in fiscal 2013 the aftertax cost for the loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 reduced earnings per share for fiscal 2015 by 001 per share the tax benefits referred to above added 011 per share to net income for fiscal 2014 while the 53 rd week benefited fiscal 2013 earnings per share by 008 per share foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results foreign currency exchange rates had a 001 negative impact on earnings per share for both fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 

our stock repurchase programs which reduce our weighted average diluted shares outstanding benefited our earnings per share growth in fiscal 2015 by 4 we repurchased 277 million shares of our stock at a cost of 17 billion in fiscal 2015 270 million shares of our stock at a cost of 15 billion in fiscal 2014 and 306 million shares of our stock at a cost of 13 billion in fiscal 2013

net sales at marmaxx increased 4 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 the increase reflected a 3 increase from new stores and a 1 increase from same store sales the same store sales increase of 1 in fiscal 2015 is on top of a 3 increase in the prior year same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase in the average transaction with a slight increase in customer traffic same store sales increases for home fashions were above the chain average while apparel overall was below the chain average within apparel jewelry and accessories and activewear were well above the average geographically same store sales increases were strongest in the southeast and southwest 

same store sales for marmaxx were up 3 in fiscal 2014 on top of a 6 increase in the prior year same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2014 was driven by an increase in average ticket we believe severe winter weather in many regions of the country particularly in the fourth quarter impacted our sales in fiscal 2014 same store sales were above the chain average for home fashions and while apparel overall was below the chain average within apparel jewelry and accessories were well above the average geographically same store sales were strongest in the west coast and florida in addition in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we launched our ecommerce site tjmaxxcom 

segment margin in fiscal 2015 was 146 flat compared to fiscal 2014 improvements in merchandise margin as well as a reduction in administrative costs and insurance costs as a percentage of sales were offset by the impact of our ecommerce businesses and expense deleverage primarily occupancy costs on the 1 same store sales growth 

  

segment margin in fiscal 2014 was 146 flat compared to fiscal 2013 the 53 rd week increased the fiscal 2013 segment margin by approximately 02 percentage points excluding the extra week in fiscal 2013 the improvement in segment margin was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margin for fiscal 2014 despite higher markdowns taken in the fourth quarter fiscal 2014 segment margin was reduced by 02 percentage points due to the impact of our ecommerce businesses but this decline in margin was largely offset by the benefit of some expense leverage and reduced incentive compensation costs as compared to the prior year 

in fiscal 2016 we expect to open approximately 70 new marmaxx stores net of closings and increase selling square footage by approximately 3 

homegoods 

 

 homegoods’ net sales increased 14 in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 on top of a 13 increase in fiscal 2014 when compared to fiscal 2013 the increase in fiscal 2015 reflected a 7 increase from new stores and a 7 increase from same store sales the same store sales increase of 7 in fiscal 2015 is on top of a same store sales increase of 7 in fiscal 2014 same store sales growth in both fiscal 2015 and 2014 was driven by an increase in the value of the average transaction along with an increase in customer traffic 

segment profit margin for fiscal 2015 was 136 up from 129 for fiscal 2014 the increase was driven by expense leverage on the 7 same store sales increase primarily buying and occupancy costs and administrative costs as well as an increase in merchandise margins segment profit margin for fiscal 2014 was 129 up from 122 for fiscal 2013 the increase in fiscal 2014 was driven by expense leverage on the 7 same store sales increase particularly buying and occupancy costs the 53 rd week increased the fiscal 2013 segment margin by approximately 02 percentage points 

in fiscal 2016 we plan a net increase of 40 homegoods stores and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 8 

  

international segments 

tjx canada 

 

 net sales for tjx canada in fiscal 2015 were essentially flat compared to fiscal 2014 while net sales reflected a 4 increase from new stores and a 3 increase from same store sales these were offset by currency translation that negatively impacted sales growth by 7 the same store sales increase of 3 in fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase in the value of the average transaction along with an increase in customer traffic same store sales were flat in fiscal 2014 net sales for tjx canada decreased 2 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 currency translation negatively impacted sales growth by 4 percentage points in fiscal 2014 as compared to the same period in the prior year same store sales increased 5 in fiscal 2013 

segment profit margin decreased 05 percentage points to 136 in fiscal 2015 the decrease in segment margin was due to a decrease in merchandise margins and the unfavorable impact of marktomarket adjustment on inventoryrelated derivatives which collectively reduced segment margin by 08 percentage points the decrease in merchandise margin was driven by changes in currency exchange rates which increased tjx canada’s cost of merchandise purchased in us dollars we expect this increase in the cost of merchandise purchased with us dollars will likely continue into fiscal 2016 based on the recent trend in currency exchange rates the decline in the fiscal 2015 segment margin was partially offset by expense leverage on same store sales particularly buying and occupancy costs along with a reduction in advertising costs as a percentage of sales 

segment profit margin decreased 01 percentage points to 141 in fiscal 2014 the decrease in segment margin was due to expense deleverage on the flat same store sales particularly occupancy and administrative costs and the absence of the 53 rd week which benefited fiscal 2013 segment margin by 02 percentage points these factors more than offset the yearoveryear favorable impact of the marktomarket adjustment on inventoryrelated derivatives of 14 million and an increase in merchandise margin 

in fiscal 2016 we plan a net increase of approximately 20 stores in canada and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 4 

  

tjx europe 

 

 net sales for tjx europe increased 13 in fiscal 2015 to 41 billion compared to 36 billion in fiscal 2014 on top of a 10 increase in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 the increase in fiscal 2015 reflected an 8 increase from new store sales 3 from same store sales and a 2 favorable impact from currency translation the fiscal 2015 same store sales increase of 3 compares to an increase of 6 in fiscal 2014 and a 10 increase in fiscal 2013 the increase in same store sales for fiscal 2015 was driven by an increase in the value of the average transaction along with an increase in customer traffic net sales for tjx europe increased 10 in fiscal 2014 to 36 billion compared to 33 billion in fiscal 2013 currency translation had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2014 sales growth 

segment profit increased 22 to 3374 million for fiscal 2015 and segment profit margin increased to 82 compared to 76 in fiscal 2014 the improvement in segment margin was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margins and expense leverage on same store sales particularly buying and occupancy costs the increase in segment margin was also largely due to the positive impact of the marktomarket adjustment on inventoryrelated derivatives these margin improvements were partially offset by an increase in store payroll costs as a percentage of sales as well as investments in talent and research to open stores in two new countries in fiscal 2016 

segment profit increased 28 to 2755 million for fiscal 2014 and segment margin increased to 76 the improvement in segment margin was due primarily to expense leverage on strong same store sales particularly buying and occupancy costs and a lower incentive compensation accrual the marktomarket adjustment on inventoryrelated derivatives had a negative impact of 03 percentage points and the 53 rd week in fiscal 2013 had a negative impact of 02 percentage points on the yearoveryear comparison of segment margin for fiscal 2014 

we expect to add approximately 50 stores net of closings in europe in fiscal 2015 and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 10 

general corporate expense 

 

 general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments virtually all general corporate expenses are included in selling general and administrative expenses overall general corporate expense in fiscal 2015 decreased slightly from the prior year this decrease reflects a favorable adjustment to our reserve for former operations in fiscal 2015 as well as 

  

costs incurred in fiscal 2014 relating to our home office relocations these reductions in general corporate expense were partially offset by an increase in stock compensation expense and higher contributions to the tjx foundation 

general corporate expense for fiscal 2014 decreased slightly from the prior year primarily due to the absence in fiscal 2014 of approximately 56 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2013 fiscal 2013 included contributions to the tjx foundation an adjustment to our reserve for former operations and the acquisition costs of stp this decline in general corporate expense was largely offset by increases in systems and technology costs stock compensation and costs relating to our home office relocations 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 3008 million in fiscal 2015 2600 million in fiscal 2014 and 3056 million in fiscal 2013 the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2015 increased 408 million compared to fiscal 2014 net income plus the noncash impact of depreciation provided cash of 2804 million in fiscal 2015 compared to 2686 million in fiscal 2014 an increase of 118 million the change in the deferred income tax provision which was driven by the tax treatment of the voluntary contributions to our funded pension plan of 150 million in fiscal 2015 favorably impacted fiscal 2015 operating cash flows by 50 million the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of 47 million in fiscal 2015 compared to a use of cash of 117 million in fiscal 2014 favorably impacting yearoveryear cash flows by 70 million the cash flow impact of the change in inventory and accounts payable was driven by the timing of receipt and payment of merchandise purchases the improvement in operating cash flows in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 reflects an increase in the receipt of merchandise later in the fourth quarter that will be paid for in the following fiscal year the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash flows by 21 million in fiscal 2015 versus an unfavorable impact of 30 million in fiscal 2014 this favorable impact of 51 million in yearoveryear cash flows from operations was driven by last year’s payment of approximately 80 million for settlements with tax authorities reducing our fiscal 2014 reserve for uncertain tax positions additionally operating cash flows increased by 122 million yearoveryear due to the change in income taxes payable and recoverable which is largely driven by the increase in the current tax provision 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2014 decreased 456 million compared to fiscal 2013 net income plus the noncash impact of depreciation provided cash of 2686 million in fiscal 2014 compared to 2416 million in fiscal 2013 an increase of 270 million the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of 117 million in fiscal 2014 compared to a source of cash of 239 million in fiscal 2013 this unfavorable impact of 356 million in yearoveryear cash flow from operations was primarily due to the timing of the receipt and payment of yearend inventory the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities unfavorably impacted operating cash flows by 30 million in fiscal 2014 versus a favorable impact of 269 million in fiscal 2013 this unfavorable impact of 299 million in yearoveryear cash flow from operations reflects the change in accrued incentive compensation and a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions as the result of a settlement with tax authorities additionally operating cash flows decreased by 165 million yearoveryear due to the change in income taxes payable which was partially offset by an increase in operating cash flows of 81 million from the change in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets 

we have a reserve for the remaining future obligations of operations we have closed sold or otherwise disposed of including among others bob’s stores and aj wright the majority of these obligations relate to real estate leases associated with these operations the reserve balance was 146 million at january 31 2015 and 314 million at february 1 2014 the cash flows required to satisfy obligations of former operations are classified as a reduction in cash provided by operating activities see note c to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

investing activities our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below 

 

 we expect that we will spend approximately 975 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 including approximately 487 million for our offices and distribution centers including buying and merchandising systems and information systems to support growth 277 million for store renovations and 211 million for new stores we plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds 

in fiscal 2015 we purchased 431 million of investments compared to 497 million in fiscal 2014 additionally 388 million of such investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2015 compared to 395 million last year this activity primarily relates to shortterm investments which had initial maturities in excess of 90 days and per our policy are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented 

we have entered into a lease agreement for the construction and occupancy of a new home office facility in canada we are deemed the owner of the construction project for accounting purposes and therefore the construction costs incurred to date by the lessor of 607 million are included as a construction in progress asset along with a related liability of the same amount on our balance sheet the asset is included in “land and buildings” and the liability is included in “other longterm liabilities” see note m to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

financing activities cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 1560 million in fiscal 2015 1144 million in fiscal 2014 and 1476 million in fiscal 2013 

in june 2014 we issued 750 million aggregate principal amount of 275 sevenyear notes generating proceeds net of debt issuance expenses and fees of 743 million in july 2014 we used a portion of the proceeds from the 275 sevenyear notes to redeem the 400 million aggregate principal amount of 420 notes paying 416 million to the note holders for the present value of principal and future remaining interest payments due on the notes in fiscal 2014 we issued 500 million of 25 tenyear notes generating proceeds net of debt issuance expenses and fees of 495 million see note k to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

tjx repurchased and retired 277 million shares of its common stock at a cost of 17 billion during fiscal 2015 on a “trade date basis” tjx reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis under our stock repurchase programs we spent 1651 million to repurchase 276 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2015 1471 million to repurchase 273 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2014 and 1345 million to repurchase 320 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2013 see note e to the consolidated financial statements for more information in february 2015 we announced that our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional 20 billion of tjx stock we currently plan to repurchase approximately 18 billion to 19 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2016 we determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow liquidity economic and market conditions our assessment of prospects for our business legal requirements and other factors the timing and amount of these purchases may change 

we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 070 per share in fiscal 2015 058 per share in fiscal 2014 and 046 per share in fiscal 2013 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 466 million in fiscal 2015 394 million in fiscal 2014 and 324 million in fiscal 2013 we also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 143 million in fiscal 2015 146 million in fiscal 2014 and 134 million in fiscal 2013 we expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2016 of 021 per share or an annual dividend of 084 per share subject to the declaration and approval of our board of directors this would represent a 20 increase over the per share dividends declared and paid for fiscal 2015 

  

we traditionally have funded our working capital requirements including for seasonal merchandise primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented as needed by shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper as of january 31 2015 our cash and cash equivalents held outside the us were 12 billion of which 4139 million was held in countries where we have the intention to reinvest any undistributed earnings indefinitely we have provided for deferred us taxes on all undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries in canada puerto rico italy india hong kong and australia if we repatriate cash from such subsidiaries we should not incur additional tax expense but our cash would be reduced by the amount of taxes paid for all other foreign subsidiaries no income taxes have been provided on the undistributed earnings because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the business we have no current plans to repatriate cash balances held by such foreign subsidiaries we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents internally generated funds and our credit facilities described in note k to the consolidated financial statements are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year 

contractual obligations as of january 31 2015 we had known contractual obligations including current installments under longterm debt arrangements operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows in thousands 

 

  

  

  

 we also have longterm liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include 4601 million for employee compensation and benefits and 281 million for uncertain tax positions 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to the areas described below 

inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except stp under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced typically a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns however as a normal business practice we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end historically the variance between estimated shrinkage and actual shrinkage has not been material to our annual financial results we do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory 

  

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and tradenames we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets goodwill and tradenames at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores as well as of our business units which involve a number of factors including historical trends recent performance and general economic assumptions if we determine that an impairment of longlived assets has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets 

retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates we are required to make economic demographic and other assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations the longterm rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets and assumptions about mortality all of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period these assumptions including the discount rate which we determine annually based on market interest rates and our estimated longterm rate of return which can differ considerably from actual returns can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan if our discount rate were decreased 025 percentage points our fiscal 2015 pension cost for our funded plan would have increased by approximately 6 million similarly an increase in the discount of rate of 025 percentage points would result in a reduction of pension cost of a similar amount a change of 025 percentage points in our longterm rate of return would increase or decrease our fiscal 2015 pension cost by approximately 2 million during fiscal 2015 we adjusted our assumptions relating to mortality the expected lives of our pension participants in light of new mortality tables issued by the society of actuaries which project longer life expectancies the change in our mortality assumptions added 59 million to the projected benefit obligation for the funded plan as of january 31 2015 and will add approximately 7 million to our fiscal 2016 pension cost when the discount rate market performance of our plan assets changes in laws regulations actuarial standards or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan our required contributions may increase we also consider these factors in determining the amount of voluntary contributions we may make to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements in fiscal 2015 we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of 150 million 

sharebased compensation in accordance with gaap we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan the fair value of the awards is amortized as “sharebased compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service we use the blackscholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results the use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost a 5 increase in expected volatility would increase the peroption value of our most recent option award by 4 while a decrease of the same amount would decrease the peroption value of our most recent option award by 5 

casualty insurance in fiscal 2013 our casualty insurance program was changed from a fixed premium program to a selfinsured program a selfinsured casualty insurance program requires us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost the estimated claims are developed with the assistance of an actuary based on historical experience and other factors these estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates if our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance for fiscal 2015 were to change by 5 the fiscal 2015 pretax cost would increase or decrease by approximately 4 million a large portion of these claims is funded with a nonrefundable payment during the policy year offsetting our estimated claims accrual we had a net accrual of 143 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of january 31 2015 

reserves for uncertain tax positions like many large corporations our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation assessment examination litigation and settlement the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain in accordance with gaap we evaluate our uncertain 

  

tax positions based on our understanding of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the positions we have taken will not be sustained however in the next twelve months and in future periods the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay as the result of the final resolutions of examinations judicial or administrative proceedings changes in facts law or legal interpretations expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of or changes in tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

reserves for former operations as discussed in note c to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the management’s discussion and analysis we have reserves for probable losses arising for future obligations of former operations primarily real estate leases we must make estimates and assumptions about the costs and expenses we will incur in connection with the future obligations of our former operations the leases relating to aj wright and other former operations are longterm obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including when and on what terms we will assign the leases or sublease the leased properties whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors including indemnification may exist to any liability we may have we develop these assumptions based on past experience and evaluation of various potential outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location actual results may differ from our current estimates and we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for future developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors although we do not expect any such differences to be material to our results of operations 

loss contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our management with the assistance of our legal counsel assesses such contingent liabilities such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend tjx is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business some potential market risks are discussed below 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the us dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations as more fully described in note f to our consolidated financial statements we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments primarily at our international operations and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international operations we enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries our foreign exchange risk management policy prohibits us from using derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes or using any leveraged derivative financial instruments we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency as of january 31 2015 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pretax income for fiscal 2015 by approximately 73 million 

equity price and other market risk 

the assets of our funded qualified pension plan a large portion of which are equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets we invest the pension assets described further in note j to the consolidated financial statements in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties investments in general are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility risks a significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan resulting in increased required contributions to the plan or other planrelated liabilities our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes

flexible business model our flexible offprice business model including our opportunistic buying inventory management logistics and store layouts is designed to deliver our customers a compelling value proposition of fashionable quality brand name and designer merchandise at excellent values our buying and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than traditional retailers and the design and operation of our stores and distribution centers support this flexibility our merchants have more visibility into consumer fashion and market trends and pricing when we buy closer to need which can help us “buy smarter” and reduce our markdown exposure our selling floor space is flexible without walls between departments and largely free of permanent fixtures so we can easily expand and contract departments to accommodate the merchandise we purchase our logistics and distribution operations are designed to support our buying strategies and to facilitate quick efficient and differentiated delivery of merchandise to our stores with a goal of getting the right merchandise to the right stores at the right times 

opportunistic buying as an offprice retailer our buying practices which we refer to as opportunistic buying differentiate us from traditional retailers our overall opportunistic buying strategy is to acquire merchandise on an ongoing basis that will enable us to offer a desirable and rapidly changing mix of branded designer and other quality merchandise in our stores at prices below regular prices for comparable merchandise at department and specialty stores we seek out and select merchandise from the broad range of opportunities in the marketplace to achieve this end our buying organization which numbers over 900 associates in 13 buying offices in ten countries executes this opportunistic buying strategy in a variety of ways depending on market conditions and other factors 

we take advantage of opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from the production and flow of inventory in the apparel and home fashions marketplace which include among others order cancellations manufacturer overruns closeouts and special production direct from brands and factories our buying strategies are intentionally flexible to allow us to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market and to adjust how and what we source as well as when we source it our goal is to operate with lean inventory levels compared to conventional retailers to give us the flexibility to seek out and to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise in contrast to traditional retailers which tend to order most of their goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor our merchants remain in the marketplace throughout the year frequently looking for opportunities to buy merchandise we buy much of our merchandise for the current or immediately upcoming selling season we also buy some merchandise that is available in the market with the intention of storing it for sale typically in future selling seasons we generally make these purchases referred to as packaway in response to opportunities in the marketplace to buy merchandise that we believe has the right combination of brand fashion quality and price to supplement the product we expect to be available to purchase later for those future seasons we also develop some merchandise that is produced for us under inhouse and licensed brands we generally acquire this type of merchandise referred to as private label to supplement the depth of or fill gaps in our expected merchandise assortment 

our expansive vendor universe which is in excess of 16000 consists primarily of manufacturers along with retailers and other vendors and provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quality merchandise for our business in either favorable or difficult 

  

retail environments and expect this will continue as we continue to grow we believe a number of factors provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise and make us an attractive channel for many vendors in the market we are typically willing to purchase lessthanfull assortments of items styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large we are able to disperse merchandise across our geographically diverse network of stores and to target specific markets we pay promptly we generally do not ask for typical retail concessions such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries or return privileges and we have financial strength and an excellent credit rating 

inventory management we offer our customers a rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a treasure hunt experience in our stores and spur customer visits to achieve this we seek to turn the inventory in our stores rapidly regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions at excellent values our specialized inventory planning purchasing monitoring and markdown systems coupled with distribution center storage processing handling and shipping systems enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local preferences and demographics achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of products and generally sell within the period we planned we make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations centrally using information provided by specialized computer systems designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner over the past several years we have been investing in our supply chain with the goal of continuing to operate with low inventory levels to ship more efficiently and quickly and to more precisely and effectively allocate merchandise to each store 

pricing our mission is to offer quality fashionable brand name and designer merchandise in our stores with retail prices that are generally 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular retail prices on comparable merchandise every day we do not generally engage in promotional pricing activity such as sales or coupons we have generally been able to react to price fluctuations in the wholesale market to maintain our pricing gap relative to prices offered by traditional retailers as well as our merchandise margins through various economic cycles 

low cost operations we operate with a low cost structure compared to many traditional retailers we focus aggressively on expenses throughout our business our advertising is generally focused on promoting our retail banners rather than individual products including at times promoting multiple banners together which contributes to our advertising budget as a percentage of sales remaining low compared to many traditional retailers we design our stores to provide a pleasant convenient shopping environment but relative to other retailers do not spend heavily on store fixtures additionally our distribution network is designed to run cost effectively 

customer serviceshopping experience we are in the process of renovating and upgrading stores across our retail banners to enhance our customers’ shopping experience and help drive sales although we offer a selfservice format we train our store associates to provide friendly and helpful customer service and seek to staff our stores to deliver a positive shopping experience we typically offer customerfriendly return policies we accept a variety of payment methods including cash credit cards and debit cards and offer tjxbranded credit cards in the us through a bank but do not own the customer receivables 

distribution we operate distribution centers encompassing approximately 12 million square feet in five countries these centers are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model we ship substantially all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers as well as warehouses and shipping centers operated by third parties we shipped approximately 2 billion units to our stores during fiscal 2014

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks that follow individually or in the aggregate are those that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements 

failure to execute our opportunistic buying strategy and inventory management could adversely affect our business 

while opportunistic buying operating with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are key elements of our offprice business strategy they subject us to risks related to the pricing quantity mix nature and timing of inventory flowing to our stores our merchants are in the marketplace frequently as much of our merchandise is purchased for the current or immediately upcoming season our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion in our merchants they react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market assess the desirability and value of merchandise and generally make determinations of how and what we source as well as when we source it if we do not obtain the right fresh desirable merchandise at the right times quantities and prices it could adversely affect traffic to our stores as well as our sales and margins 

we base our purchases of inventory in part on our sales forecasts if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory leading to decreased profit margins or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales either of which could adversely affect our financial performance 

if we are unable to generally purchase inventory at prices sufficiently below prices paid by conventional retailers we may not be able to maintain an overall pricing differential to regular department and specialty stores and our ability to attract customers and sustain our margins may be adversely affected we may not achieve this at various times or in some divisions or geographies which could adversely affect our results or those of one of our segments 

we must also properly execute our inventory management strategy of delivering the right product to the right stores at the right time we need to appropriately allocate merchandise among our stores timely and efficiently distribute inventory to stores maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store appropriately change the allocation of floor space of stores among product categories to respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns there is no assurance we will be able to do so 

in addition to our own execution we may need to react to factors affecting inventory flow that are outside our control discussed further below such as extreme weather and natural disasters or other changes in conditions affecting our vendors and others in our supply chain such as political instability labor issues including strikes or threats of strikes or increasing cost of regulations if we are not able to adjust appropriately to such factors our inventory management may be affected which could impact our performance and our relationship with our customers 

failure to continue to expand our business and operations successfully or to manage our substantial size and scale effectively could adversely affect our financial results 

our growth strategy includes successfully expanding our offprice model in our current markets and in new geographic regions product lines businesses and channels and as appropriate adding new businesses whether by development investment or acquisition there are significant risks associated with our ability to 

  

continue to successfully extend our current business and to enter new businesses including managing the implementation of this growth effectively if any aspect of our expansion strategy does not achieve the success we expect in whole or in part we may be required to increase our investment slow our planned growth or close stores or operations which could adversely affect our financial performance successful store growth requires us to find and lease appropriate real estate on attractive terms in each of the locations where we seek to open stores our ability to do so depends among other things on availability and selection of appropriate sites in appropriate geographies degree of competition for sites factors affecting costs such as real estate construction and development costs and costs and availability of capital and variations in or changes to zoning or other land use regulations if we cannot lease appropriate sites on attractive terms it could limit our ability to successfully grow in various markets or adversely affect the economics of new stores in various markets we also may encounter difficulties in attracting customers when we enter new markets as discussed further below new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores and adding stores to existing markets may adversely affect stores’ sales and profitability as we expand our model we may have difficulty effectively meeting customer expectations which may change rapidly and differ from those we anticipate 

further our substantial size imposes demands on maintaining appropriate internal resources and third party providers to support our business effectively expansion places increased demands on management and various functions across our business including administration merchandising store operations distribution and compliance and on appropriately staffing and training personnel in these areas as we grow in addition under our business model some aspects of the businesses and operations of our chains in the us canada and europe are conducted with relative autonomy the large size and scale of our operations our multiple chains in the us canada and europe and the autonomy afforded to the chains increase the risk that our systems and practices will not be implemented appropriately throughout our company and that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations which risks may increase as we continue to grow if business information is not shared effectively or if we are otherwise unable to manage our growth effectively we may operate with decreased operational efficiency may need to reduce our rate of expansion of one or more operations or otherwise curtail growth in one or more markets which may adversely affect our success in executing our business goals and adversely impact our sales and results each of these risks may increase as we continue to grow particularly as we expand into additional countries 

failure to identify customer trends and preferences to meet customer demand in new or existing markets or channels could negatively impact our performance 

because our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand we work to identify customer trends and preferences on an ongoing basis and to offer inventory that meets those trends and preferences however doing so across our diverse merchandise categories and in the many markets in the united states canada and europe in which we do business on a timely basis is challenging trends and preferences in new markets may differ from what we anticipate although our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer preferences and trends and to expand and contract merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes we may not successfully do so which could adversely affect our results customers may also have expectations about how they shop in stores or through ecommerce or more generally engage with businesses across different channels or media through internetbased and other digital or mobile communication channels or other forms of social media which may vary across demographics and may evolve rapidly meeting demand effectively involves identifying the right opportunities and making the right investments at the right time and speed among other things and failure to do so may impact our reputation and our financial results 

if we fail to successfully implement our marketing advertising and promotional programs or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are our revenue or results of operations may be adversely affected 

customer traffic and demand for our merchandise is influenced by our advertising marketing and promotional activities the name recognition and reputation of our chains and the location of and service offered in our stores although we use marketing advertising and promotional programs to attract customers to our 

  

stores through various media including television social media database marketing print and direct marketing and loyalty programs some of our competitors expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage our marketing advertising and promotional programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations we may need to adjust our marketing advertising and promotional programs effectively and more quickly as internetbased and other digital or mobile communication channels and other social media rapidly evolve and we may not successfully do so 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive we compete with local regional national and international retailers that sell apparel home fashions and other merchandise we sell including in stores through catalogues or other media or over the internet some of our competitors are larger than we are or have more experience in selling certain product lines than we do new competitors frequently enter the market and existing competitors enter or increase their presence in the markets in which we operate expand their merchandise offerings add new sales channels or change their pricing methods all of which increase competition for customers we compete on the basis of fashion quality price value merchandise selection and freshness brand name recognition customer service reputation and store location our competitiveness is highly dependent on our effective execution of our offprice model of offering our customers a fresh rapidly changing and attractive mix of merchandise delivering value if we fail to compete effectively our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 

failure to attract train and retain quality associates in appropriate numbers including key associates and management as well as costs related to our labor force could adversely affect our performance 

our performance depends on recruiting developing training and retaining quality sales systems distribution center and other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel 

many of our associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover availability and skill of associates may differ across markets in which we do business and in new markets we enter and our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs including costs of providing retirement health and other employee benefits is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates and minimum wage requirements changing demographics economic conditions health and other insurance costs and the regulatory environment including health care legislation immigration law and governmental labor and employment and employee benefits requirements certain associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions of various kinds as well as risks and potential expenses associated with multiemployer plans including from potential withdrawal liability and potential insolvency of other participating employers other associates are members of works councils which may subject us to additional actions or expense in addition any failure of third parties that perform services on our behalf to comply with immigration employment or other laws and regulations could damage our reputation or disrupt our ability to obtain needed labor when wage rates or benefit levels increase in a market failing to increase our wages or benefits competitively could result in a decline in the quality of our workforce causing our customer service to suffer while increasing our wages or benefits could cause our earnings to decrease 

because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must provide significant internal training and development for key associates across the company including within our buying organization similar to other retailers we face challenges in securing and retaining sufficient talent in management and other key areas for many reasons including competition in the retail industry generally and for talent in various geographic markets if we do not continue to attract qualified individuals train them in our business model support their development and retain them our performance could be adversely affected or our growth could be limited 

  

global economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

global financial markets can experience extreme volatility disruption and credit contraction which adversely affect global economic conditions turmoil in the financial and credit markets or other changes in economic conditions could adversely affect sources of liquidity available to us or our costs of capital and could adversely affect plan asset values and investment performance increasing our pension liabilities expenses and funding requirements with respect to companysponsored and multiemployer pension plans economic conditions both on a global level and in particular markets including unemployment decreased disposable income and actual and perceived wealth energy and health care costs interest and tax rates and policies weakness in the housing market volatility in capital markets decreased credit availability inflation and deflation as well as political or other factors beyond our control such as threats or possibilities of war terrorism global or national unrest actual or threatened epidemics and political instability may also have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending consumer spending in turn affects retail sales these conditions and factors could adversely affect discretionary consumer spending and although we believe our flexible offprice model helps us react they may adversely affect our sales cash flows and results of operations and performance 

compromises of our data security could materially harm our reputation and business 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect store process and transmit certain information from individuals such as our customers and associates including for example customer payment card and check information 

we suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions such intrusion or intrusions collectively the “computer intrusion” into portions of our computer system that process and store information related to customer transactions discovered late in 2006 in which we believe customer data were stolen we have taken steps designed to further strengthen the security of our computer system and protocols and have instituted an ongoing program with respect to data security consistent with a consent order with the federal trade commission to assess the ongoing effectiveness of our information security program and to maintain and enhance our program as appropriate nevertheless there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a future data compromise that unauthorized parties will not gain access to the information that we collect store process or transmit or that any such data compromise or access will be discovered in a timely way 

we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of personal andor confidential information further the systems and processes currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk are determined and controlled by the banking and payment card industry not by us this is also true for check information and approval computer hackers may for example attempt to penetrate our computer systems and if successful misappropriate customer or associate information or confidential business information of our company in addition an associate contractor or third party with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations may fail to monitor the systems effectively misuse the personal or confidential information to which they have access attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to access or misappropriate such types of information or may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information advances in computer and software technology and capabilities new tools and other developments including the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals generally may increase the risk of such a breach 

compromise of our data security or that of third parties with whom we do business failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business information and delays in detecting any such compromise or loss could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and customers’ willingness to shop in our stores violate applicable laws regulations orders and agreements and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material 

failure to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information systems including data centers hardware and software and applications to manage many aspects of our business including to process and record transactions in our 

  

stores to enable effective communication systems to plan and track inventory flow to manage logistics and to generate performance and financial reports we are dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems our computer systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from a number of causes including power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches cyberattacks catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and design or usage errors by our associates or contractors although we seek to maintain our systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromises of the integrity security and consistent operations of our systems we may not be successful in doing so compromises interruptions or shutdowns of our systems including those managed by third parties could lead to delays in our business operations and if significant or extreme affect our results of operations 

we modify update and replace our systems and its infrastructure from time to time including by adding new hardware software and applications maintaining updating or replacing legacy programs converting to global systems integrating new service providers and adding enhanced or new functionality such as for cloud computing technologies and for the continued operation and development of our ecommerce businesses and adding new systems when we acquire new businesses we also modify and change our procedures for and add and change vendors and internal teams who assist us with designing implementing and maintaining our systems although we believe we are diligent in selecting systems vendors and procedures to enable us to maintain the integrity of our systems when we modify them there are inherent risks associated with modifying or replacing systems with new or changed relationships and with changes from acquisitions including accurately capturing and maintaining data realizing the expected benefit of the change and managing the potential disruption of the operation of the systems and diversion to internal teams’ attention as the changes are implemented potential issues associated with implementing technology initiatives and the time and resources required to optimize the benefits of new elements of our systems and its infrastructure could reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term in addition any interruption in the operation of our ecommerce websites could cause us to suffer reputational harm or to lose sales if customers are unable to access our site or purchase merchandise from us during such interruption the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends upon our information systems including our ability to operate and maintain them effectively to select appropriate vendors to maintain or enhance them and to select and implement appropriate new technologies systems controls hardware software and applications and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems and the third party systems we rely on to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm our profitability 

as our business is subject to seasonal influences a decrease in sales or margins during the second half of the year could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our operating results 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we generally realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the year which includes the backtoschool and yearend holiday seasons any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations 

adverse or unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate or our distribution centers are located could adversely affect our operating results 

both adverse and unseasonable weather such as storms severe cold or heat or unseasonable temperatures affect customers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop certain categories or at all and accordingly can adversely affect the demand for the merchandise in our stores particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise  weather can also affect the ability to transport merchandise to our stores from our distribution and shipping centers or elsewhere in our supply chain efficiently or in a timely way as a result adverse or unseasonable weather in our markets could adversely affect our sales increase markdowns and adversely affect our operating results 

  

our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic events 

unforeseen public health issues such as pandemics and epidemics natural or other disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other extreme weather and climate conditions or fires explosions and acts of war or terrorism in any of our markets could disrupt our operations or the operations of one or more of our vendors or of our supply chain or could severely damage or destroy one or more of our stores or distribution facilities located in the affected areas daytoday operations particularly our ability to receive products from our vendors or transport products to our stores could be adversely affected or we could be required to close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by affected distribution centers for a short or extended period of time as a result our business could be adversely affected 

damage to our corporate reputation or those of our retail banners could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

we believe that building the brand reputation of our retail banners is important to our continuing success and we expend resources building relationships with our customers through traditional and social media and other advertising and promotional activities our reputation is based in part on perceptions of subjective qualities so incidents involving us merchandise that we carry or our industry more generally that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business particularly if the incidents result in rapid or significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry similarly information about us our retail banners and the merchandise we sell including our licensed or owned brands publicized through traditional or social media platforms and similar venues including blogs websites and other forums for internetbased communications that allow individuals almost immediate access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons may adversely affect our reputation and brand even if the information is unverified or inaccurate the reputation of our company and our retail banners may be damaged by adverse events at the corporate level or at our retail banners damage to the reputation of our company and our banners could result in declines in customer loyalty and sales affect our vendor relationships development opportunities and associate retention and otherwise adversely affect our business 

issues with merchandise quality or safety could damage our reputation sales and financial results 

various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we sell to consumers regulations and standards in this area including those related to the us consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 state regulations like california’s proposition 65 and similar legislation in other countries in which we operate impose restrictions and requirements on the merchandise we sell in our stores and through ecommerce these regulations change from time to time and new federal state provincial or local regulations in the us and other countries that may affect our business are contemplated and enacted with some regularity if we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements on a timely basis or at all or to adequately monitor new regulations that may apply to existing or new merchandise categories or in new geographies significant fines or penalties could be incurred or we could have to curtail some aspects of our sales or operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results we rely on our vendors to provide quality merchandise that complies with applicable product safety laws and other applicable laws but they may not comply with their obligations to do so although our arrangements with our vendors frequently provide for indemnification for product liabilities the vendors may fail to honor those obligations to an extent we consider sufficient or at all issues with the quality and safety of merchandise particularly with food bath and body and children’s products and issues with the genuineness of merchandise or customer concerns about such issues regardless of our fault could cause damage to our reputation and could result in lost sales uninsured product liability claims or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs and regulatory civil or criminal fines or penalties any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

our expanding international operations may expose us to risks inherent in operating in new countries 

we have a significant retail presence in canada and countries in europe and have established buying offices around the world and our goal is to continue to expand our operations into other international markets in the future such as continued expansion in europe it can be costly and complex to establish develop and maintain 

  

international operations and promote business in new international jurisdictions which may differ significantly from the us and other countries in which we currently operate in addition to facing risks similar to our us and current international operations such as with regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act we face additional risks inherent in operating in new countries such as understanding the retail climate and trends local customs and competitive conditions and complying with relevant laws rules and regulations developing the appropriate infrastructure for local operations as well as financial risks including currency exchange fluctuations and adverse tax consequences or limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds outside of the country where earned which could have an adverse impact on our operations profitability or liquidity complying with applicable laws and our own internal policies may require us to spend additional time and resources to implement new procedures and financial controls conduct audits train associates and third parties on our compliance methods or take other actions which could adversely impact our operations 

we are subject to risks associated with importing merchandise from other countries 

many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a lesser extent by us in many countries outside of the country where the stores are located particularly southeastern asia where we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those imposed upon the manufacturer of such products we are subject to the various risks of importing merchandise from other countries and purchasing product made in other countries such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates labor conditions transport capacity and costs systems issues problems in thirdparty distribution and warehousing and other interruptions of the supply chain compliance with laws and regulations and other factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise beyond our control could affect the availability and the price of our inventory furthermore although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to operating in nonus jurisdictions and importing merchandise there can be no assurance that contractors agents vendors or other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our operations or operating results 

our results may be adversely affected by reduced availability or increases in the price of oil or other fuels raw materials and other commodities 

energy and fuel costs have fluctuated dramatically and had significant cost increases in the past particularly the price of oil and gasoline an increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers although we implement a 

  

hedging strategy designed to manage a portion of our transportation costs that strategy may not be effective or sufficient and increases in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs which could have an adverse effect on our performance increased regulation related to environmental costs including cap and trade or other emissions management systems could also adversely affect our costs of doing business including utility costs transportation and logistics 

similarly other commodity prices can fluctuate dramatically such as the cost of cotton and synthetic fabrics which at times have risen significantly such increases can increase the cost of merchandise which could adversely affect our performance through potentially reduced consumer demand or reduced margins 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and changes in currency exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into us dollars for financial reporting purposes because of this movements in currency exchange rates have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our consolidated and segment results from time to time changes in currency exchange rates can also increase the cost of inventory purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the business buying the merchandise when these changes occur suddenly it can be difficult for us to adjust retail prices accordingly and gross margin can be adversely affected a significant amount of merchandise we offer for sale is made in china and accordingly a revaluation of the chinese currency or increased market flexibility in the exchange rate for that currency increasing its value relative to the us dollar or currencies in which our stores are located could be significant 

additionally we routinely enter into inventoryrelated derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rates on merchandise margins of merchandise purchases by our divisions denominated in currencies other than their local currencies in accordance with gaap we evaluate the fair value of these derivative instruments and make marktomarket adjustments at the end of each accounting period these adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our earnings 

although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates we expect that currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations from time to time in addition fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our earnings and operating results if a counterparty to one of our hedging arrangements fails to perform 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate and may fall short of prior periods our projections or the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past and they may continue to do so in the future if we fail to increase our results over prior periods to achieve our projected results or goals or to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline and the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance results may be affected by various factors including those described in these risk factors most of our operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not vary directly with the amount of our sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term as a result if sales in a particular quarter are below our expectations for that quarter we generally are not able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter resulting in a disproportionate effect on our net income for the quarter we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to project sales and align expenses if we do not control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results or if actual results differ significantly from our forecast our financial performance could be adversely affected in addition if we do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplated pursuant to our stock repurchase programs our earnings per share may be adversely affected 

  

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions or investments in new businesses or divest close or consolidate any of our current businesses our business will be subject to additional risks 

we may acquire new businesses invest in or enter into joint ventures with other businesses develop new businesses internally and divest close or consolidate businesses acquisition investment or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses and we may not effectively evaluate target companies or investments or assess the risks benefits and cost of buying investing in or closing businesses or of the integration of acquired businesses all of which can be difficult timeconsuming and dilutive acquisitions and investments may not meet our performance and other expectations and acquisition investments closings and divestitures may expose us to unexpected or greaterthanexpected costs liabilities and risks divestitures closings and consolidations also involve risks such as significant costs and obligations of closure including exposure on leases owned real estate and other contractual employment pension and severance obligations and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer failure to execute on mergers acquisitions investments divestitures closings and consolidations in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 

failure to comply with existing laws regulations and orders or changes in existing laws and regulations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

we are subject to federal state provincial regional and local laws rules and regulations in the united states and other countries any of which may change from time to time as well as orders and assurances these legal regulatory and administrative requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business from cost of health care and retirement benefits workforce management logistics marketing importexport sourcing and manufacturing data protection and others if we fail to comply with these laws rules regulations and orders we may be subject to fines or other costs or penalties which could materially adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition further applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time and the changes could have material effects on our reported financial results and condition 

we must also comply with new and changing laws and regulations new regulatory initiatives evolving interpretation of existing laws by judicial and regulatory authorities and reforms in jurisdictions where we do business these changes could increase our costs of compliance or of doing business and could adversely affect our operating results including those involving 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation legal proceedings and other legal matters 

we are involved or may in the future become involved in legal proceedings regulatory reviews audits or other legal matters these may involve inquiries investigations lawsuits and other proceedings by local provincial state and federal governmental entities in the united states and other countries and private plaintiffs including with respect to tax escheat whistleblower claims employment and employee benefits including classification employment rights discrimination wage and hour and retaliation securities disclosure real estate tort consumer protection privacy product safety advertising and intellectual property there continue to be a number of employmentrelated lawsuits including putative class actions in the united states and we 

  

are subject to these types of suits we cannot predict the results of legal and regulatory proceedings with certainty and actual results may differ from any reserves we establish estimating the probable outcome regardless of merit or outcome litigation can be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expense and diversion of management attention legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations could expose us to significant defense costs fines penalties and liability to private parties and governmental entities for monetary recoveries and other amounts and attorneys’ fees andor require us to change aspects of our operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including the results of tax audits and examinations income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory income tax rates changes in income tax rates changes in transfer pricing changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in applicable tax legislation regulations and treaties exposure to additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision and accruals for taxes and actual results may differ from our estimations 

we are subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state provincial and local tax authorities in the us and foreign countries and the examining authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various proceedings which are at various stages with such authorities with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these proceedings to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of our provision for income taxes and increase and decrease our provision as a result of these assessments however the developments in and actual results of proceedings or the result of rulings by or settlements with tax authorities and courts or due to changes in facts law or legal interpretations expiration of applicable statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions could differ from the amounts we have accrued for such proceedings in either a positive or a negative manner which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations in addition we are subject to tax audits and examinations for payroll value added salesbased and other taxes relating to our businesses 

our real estate leases generally obligate us for long periods which subjects us to financial risks 

we lease virtually all of our store locations generally for an initial term of ten years with options to renew the term and either own or lease for long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices accordingly we are subject to the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate which can adversely affect our results as for example was the case in the closure of various of our former operations while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions including by making specified payments we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so if we decide to close stores we are generally required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases which generally includes among other things paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or paying to exercise rights to terminate and the performance of any of these obligations may be expensive when we assign leases or sublease space to third parties we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform in addition when the lease term for the stores in our ongoing operations expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close stores or to relocate stores within a market on less favorable terms 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our operations growth stock repurchases and dividends and interest and debt repayment 

our business depends upon our operations to continue to generate strong cash flow to supply capital to support our general operating activities to fund our growth and our return of cash to stockholders through our 

  

stock repurchase programs and dividends and to pay our interest and debt repayments our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or to repatriate cash from our international operations in a manner that is cost effective could adversely affect our growth plans and financial performance including our earnings per share we borrow on occasion to finance our activities and if financing were not available to us in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed it could also adversely affect our financial performance

overview 

we are the leading offprice apparel and home fashions retailer in the us and worldwide we sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices on comparable merchandise every day we operate over 3200 stores through our four main segments in the us marmaxx which operates tj maxx marshalls and tjmaxxcom and homegoods tjx canada which operates winners homesense and marshalls in canada and tjx europe which operates tk maxx homesense and tkmaxxcom in europe late in fiscal 2013 tjx acquired sierra trading post stp a leading offprice internet retailer which operates four stores and sierratradingpostcom in the us the results of stp have been reported with the marmaxx segment 

fiscal 2014 was another successful year for tjx as we posted solid gains in same store sales net sales and earnings per share on top of strong increases in both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 we increased our ecommerce presence by launching our new ecommerce website tjmaxxcom during the third quarter of fiscal 2014 and successfully transitioned stp into the tjx family we continued our focus on operating with lean inventory levels and reinvesting in our business by adding new stores remodeling existing ones and strengthening our infrastructure to support our next level of growth we also continued using cash to return value to our shareholders highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2014 include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

the following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results followed by a discussion of our segment operating results adjusted measures exclude certain items affecting comparability see “adjusted financial measures” below 

net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal 2014 totaled 274 billion a 6 increase over 259 billion in fiscal 2013 the increase reflected a 4 increase from new stores a 3 increase from same store sales and a 1 increase from stp offset by a 2 decrease attributable to the 53 rd week included in fiscal 2013 foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2014 net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal 2013 totaled 259 billion a 12 increase over 232 billion in fiscal 2012 the increase reflected a 7 increase from same store sales a 3 increase from new stores and a 2 increase from the impact of the 53 rd week in the fiscal 2013 calendar foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2013 net sales 

same store sales increases in the us for fiscal 2014 were driven by an increase in average ticket as well as a slight increase in customer traffic we believe unfavorable weather in many regions where we operate had a negative impact on sales during the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014 sales from jewelry and accessories and home fashions performed particularly well in fiscal 2014 geographically in the us sales were strongest in the west coast and florida same store sales at tjx europe were above the consolidated average while same store sales at tjx canada were below the consolidated average 

same store sales increases in the us for fiscal 2013 were driven by an increase in customer traffic and to a lesser extent an increase in the value of the average transaction sales of both apparel and home fashions were equally strong geographically same store sales increases in the us were strong throughout most regions with florida and the southwest performing above the consolidated average and virtually all other regions close to the consolidated average our foreign segments both posted same store sales increases with tjx europe above the consolidated average and tjx canada below the consolidated average 

we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated on a constant currency basis meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance we define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the same store sales calculation and define average ticket to be the average retail price of the units sold we define average transaction to be the average dollar value of transactions included in the same store sales calculation 

  

the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales on an as reported and as adjusted basis 

 

  

  

 impact of foreign currency exchange rates  our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows 

 

  

 cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 715 in fiscal 2014 716 in fiscal 2013 and 727 in fiscal 2012 the 53 rd week in fiscal 2013 which benefitted that year’s expense ratio by approximately 02 percentage points impacts yearoveryear comparisons the 01 percentage point improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to slight expense leverage in buying and occupancy costs as merchandise margins were comparable to the prior year 

the 11 percentage point improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2013 was primarily due to improved merchandise margins driven by lower markdowns as well as expense leverage on the strong same store sales increase and the approximately 02 percentage points benefit from the 53 rd week in fiscal 2013 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 163 in fiscal 2014 164 in fiscal 2013 and 168 in fiscal 2012 on an 

  

adjusted basis this ratio was 165 in fiscal 2012 the improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2014 was primarily due to yearoveryear favorability from a combination of items that negatively impacted last year’s expense ratio as described below 

the improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2013 was primarily due to expense leverage on strong same store sales partially offset by contributions to the tjx foundation and by expenses related to two third quarter items a noncash charge for the cumulative impact of a correction to our pension accrual for prior years and a nonoperating charge due to the adjustment in our reserve for former operations relating to closed stores 

interest expense net the components of interest expense net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

 

 interest expense net increased in fiscal 2014 as a result of the interest cost of the 500 million 250 tenyear notes that were issued on may 2 2013 partially offset by an increase in interest income and an increase in capitalized interest on major capital projects that have not yet been placed in service 

income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was 356 in fiscal 2014 380 in fiscal 2013 and 380 in fiscal 2012 the decrease in the fiscal 2014 effective income tax rate as compared to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to fiscal 2014 third quarter tax benefits of approximately 80 million which were primarily due to a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with state taxing authorities and the reversal of valuation allowances against foreign net operating loss carryfowards see note l to the consolidated financial statements for more information these benefits reduced the fiscal 2014 effective income tax rate by 14 percentage points and 08 percentage points respectively tjx’s effective rate remained constant for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 the fiscal 2013 effective tax rate benefitted from an increase in foreign earnings which are taxed at lower rates but this benefit was offset by the absence of the benefit in fiscal 2012 due to a net reduction in federal and state tax reserves 

net income and diluted earnings per share net income was 21 billion in fiscal 2014 a 12 increase over 19 billion in fiscal 2013 which in turn was a 27 increase over 15 billion in fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share were 294 in fiscal 2014 255 in fiscal 2013 and 193 in fiscal 2012 the tax benefits referred to above added 011 per share to net income for fiscal 2014 while the 53 rd week benefitted fiscal 2013 earnings per share by 008 per share foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results foreign currency exchange rates had a 001 negative impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 and an immaterial impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 

our stock repurchase program which reduces our weighted average diluted shares outstanding benefits our earnings per share we repurchased 270 million shares of our stock at a cost of 15 billion in fiscal 2014 306 million shares of our stock at a cost of 13 billion in fiscal 2013 and 497 million shares of our stock at a cost of 14 billion in fiscal 2012 

adjusted financial measures in addition to presenting financial results in conformity with gaap we are also presenting certain measures on an “adjusted” basis we have adjusted certain measures for fiscal 2012 by excluding costs related to the aj wright consolidation incurred in fiscal 2012 these costs include store closing costs additional operating losses related to the aj wright stores closed in fiscal 2012 and the costs incurred by the marmaxx and homegoods segments to convert former aj wright stores to their banners and hold grand reopening events for these stores 

  

these adjusted financial results are nongaap financial measures we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial results provides additional information on comparisons between periods including underlying trends of our business by excluding these items that affect overall comparability we use these adjusted measures in making financial operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance and our board of directors uses them in assessing our business and making compensation decisions nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap 

reconciliation of the adjusted financial measures to the financial measures in accordance with gaap for fiscal 2012 is provided below 

 

   

  

  

  

 the costs to convert aj wright stores to other banners and to hold grand reopenings affected our marmaxx and homegoods segments in fiscal 2012 a reconciliation of adjusted segment margin a nongaap financial measure to segment margin as reported in accordance with gaap for each of these segments is as follows 

 

   

  

 segment information we operate four main business segments marmaxx tj maxx marshalls and tjmaxxcom and homegoods both operate in the united states our tjx canada segment operates winners homesense and marshalls in canada and our tjx europe segment operates tk maxx homesense and tkmaxxcom in europe late in fiscal 2013 we acquired stp an offprice internet retailer in the us the results of stp have been reported with our marmaxx segment we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest expense “segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities the terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales these measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 

  

presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments 

us segments 

marmaxx 

 

  

 at february 1 2014 and february 2 2013 stp operated 4 stores with a selling square footage of 83000 

net sales at marmaxx increased 5 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 same store sales for marmaxx were up 3 in fiscal 2014 on top of a 6 increase in the prior year same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2014 was driven by an increase in average ticket we believe severe winter weather in many regions of the country particularly in the fourth quarter impacted our sales in fiscal 2014 same store sales were above the chain average for home fashions and while apparel overall was below the chain average within apparel jewelry and accessories were well above the average geographically same store sales were strongest in the west coast and florida in addition in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 we launched our new ecommerce site tjmaxxcom 

same store sales for marmaxx were up 6 in fiscal 2013 on top of a 5 increase in the prior year same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2013 was driven by an increase in customer traffic with both apparel and home fashions posting solid same store sales gains geographically same store sales were strong throughout the country 

segment margin in fiscal 2014 was 146 flat compared to fiscal 2013 the 53 rd week increased the fiscal 2013 segment margin by approximately 02 percentage points excluding the extra week last year the improvement in segment margin was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margin for fiscal 2014 despite higher markdowns taken in the fourth quarter fiscal 2014 segment margin was reduced by 02 percentage points due to the impact of our ecommerce businesses but this decline in margin was largely offset by the benefit of some expense leverage and reduced incentive compensation costs as compared to the prior year 

segment margin was up 11 percentage points to 146 for fiscal 2013 compared to 135 for fiscal 2012 this increase was primarily due to a 06 percentage point improvement in merchandise margin largely due to lower markdowns the fiscal 2013 segment margin also benefitted from expense leverage particularly occupancy costs which improved by 04 percentage points on strong same store sales growth and the 53 rd week which increased the fiscal 2013 segment margin by approximately 02 percentage points 

in fiscal 2015 we expect to open approximately 75 new marmaxx stores net of closings and increase selling square footage by approximately 3 

  

homegoods 

 

  homegoods’ net sales increased 13 in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 on top of an 18 increase in fiscal 2013 when compared to fiscal 2012 same store sales increased 7 in fiscal 2014 on top of a same store sales increase of 7 in fiscal 2013 same store sales growth was driven by an increase in the value of the average transaction along with an increase in customer traffic for fiscal 2014 while same store sales growth in fiscal 2013 was driven by an increase in customer traffic and to a lesser extent an increase in the value of the average transaction 

segment profit margin for fiscal 2014 was 129 up from 122 for fiscal 2013 the increase was driven by expense leverage on the 7 same store sales increase primarily buying and occupancy costs segment profit margin for fiscal 2013 was 122 up from 104 for fiscal 2012 the increase was also driven by expense leverage on the 7 same store sales increase particularly occupancy and administrative costs as well as an increase in merchandise margins the 53 rd week increased the fiscal 2013 segment margin by approximately 02 percentage points adjusted segment profit margin for fiscal 2012 which excludes the aj wright conversion costs was 106 

in fiscal 2015 we plan a net increase of approximately 35 homegoods stores and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 7 

aj wright 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 we completed the consolidation of aj wright our former offprice chain targeting lower middle income customers converting 90 of the aj wright stores to tj maxx marshalls or homegoods banners and closing aj wright’s remaining 72 stores two distribution centers and home office these closing costs primarily leaserelated obligations and aj wright operating losses totaled 493 million and were reported as an aj wright segment loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 due to the anticipated migration of aj wright customers to our other us segments aj wright was not treated as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes 

  

international segments 

tjx canada 

 

 net sales for tjx canada decreased 2 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 currency translation negatively impacted sales growth by 121 million or 4 percentage points in fiscal 2014 as compared to last year on a constant currency basis net sales for fiscal 2014 increased 2 as compared to fiscal 2013 same store sales were flat in fiscal 2014 compared to an increase of 5 in fiscal 2013 we believe that unfavorable weather in the first and fourth quarters had a negative impact on same store sales net sales for tjx canada increased 9 in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 currency translation negatively impacted sales growth by 1 percentage point in fiscal 2013 as compared to the same period in the prior year same store sales increased 5 in fiscal 2013 compared to a decrease of 1 in fiscal 2012 

segment profit margin decreased 01 percentage point to 141 in fiscal 2014 the decrease in segment margin was due to expense deleverage on the flat same store sales particularly occupancy and administrative costs and the absence of the 53 rd week which benefitted fiscal 2013 segment margin by 02 percentage points these factors more than offset the yearoveryear favorable impact of the marktomarket adjustment on inventoryrelated hedges of 14 million and an increase in merchandise margin merchandise margin increased for the full year in fiscal 2014 despite the negative impact on fourth quarter merchandise margins caused by the decline in the value of the canadian dollar tjx canada buys a significant portion of its merchandise in us dollars while our inventory hedges help mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations during fiscal 2014 the value of the canadian dollar depreciated more dramatically beyond the hedges we placed throughout the year and effectively increased the cost of merchandise bought in us dollars during the latter half of fiscal 2014 

segment profit for fiscal 2013 increased to 4149 million and segment profit margin increased 12 percentage points to 142 the improvement in segment margin was driven by increased merchandise margin largely due to lower markdowns this increase in segment margin was partially offset by increased incentive compensation accruals in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 foreign currency translation and the marktomarket adjustment on inventoryrelated hedges did not have a significant impact on fiscal 2013 segment profit and segment margin 

we expect to add a net of approximately 20 stores in canada in fiscal 2015 including 10 new marshalls stores and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 5 

  

tjx europe 

 

 net sales for tjx europe increased 10 in fiscal 2014 to 36 billion compared to 33 billion in fiscal 2013 currency translation had an immaterial impact on sales growth in fiscal 2014 fiscal 2014 same store sales increased 6 compared to an increase of 10 in fiscal 2013 the increase in same store sales for fiscal 2014 was driven by an increase in customer traffic along with an increase in the average transaction net sales for tjx europe increased 14 in fiscal 2013 to 33 billion compared to 29 billion in fiscal 2012 currency translation negatively impacted fiscal 2013 sales growth by 2 percentage points fiscal 2013 same store sales increased 10 compared to an increase of 2 in fiscal 2012 

segment profit increased 28 to 2755 million for fiscal 2014 and segment profit margin increased to 76 the improvement in segment margin was due primarily to expense leverage on strong same store sales particularly occupancy and buying costs and a lower incentive compensation accrual the marktomarket adjustment on inventory hedges had a negative impact of 03 percentage points and the 53 rd week last year had a negative impact of 02 percentage points on the yearoveryear comparison of segment margin for fiscal 2014 

segment profit more than tripled to 2157 million for fiscal 2013 and segment profit margin increased to 66 the improvements we saw in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 in this segment’s performance as we slowed growth and refocused on offprice fundamentals continued throughout fiscal 2013 more than half of the improvement in segment margin came from improved merchandise margins which was virtually all due to lower markdowns segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 benefitted from the absence of the fiscal 2012 charges for closing an office facility and the writeoff of certain technology systems and other adjustments the impact of foreign currency translation and the marktomarket adjustment on inventoryrelated hedges was immaterial for fiscal 2013 

we expect to add approximately 40 net stores in europe in fiscal 2015 and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 9 

general corporate expense 

 

 general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling general and administrative expenses overall general corporate expense in fiscal 2014 decreased slightly from the prior year this decrease was primarily due 

  

to the absence in fiscal 2014 of approximately 56 million of costs incurred in fiscal 2013 described below this decline in general corporate expense was largely offset by increases in systems and technology costs stock compensation and costs relating to our home office relocations 

general corporate expense for fiscal 2013 included contributions to the tjx foundation an adjustment to our reserve for former operations and the acquisition costs of stp these items account for 56 million of the increase in general corporate expense as compared to fiscal 2012 in addition general corporate expense for fiscal 2013 includes increased incentive compensation accruals under our performancebased plans additional investments in systems and technology and additional costs related to the expansion of our home office facilities 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 2590 million in fiscal 2014 3046 million in fiscal 2013 and 1916 million in fiscal 2012 the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2014 decreased 456 million compared to fiscal 2013 net income plus the noncash impact of depreciation provided cash of 2686 million in fiscal 2014 compared to 2416 million in fiscal 2013 an increase of 270 million the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of 117 million in fiscal 2014 compared to a source of cash of 239 million in fiscal 2013 this unfavorable impact of 356 million in yearoveryear cash flow from operations was primarily due to the timing of the acquisition and payment of yearend inventory the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities unfavorably impacted cash flows by 30 million in fiscal 2014 versus a favorable impact of 269 million in fiscal 2013 this unfavorable impact of 299 million in yearoveryear cash flow from operations reflects the change in accrued incentive compensation and a reduction in our reserve for uncertain tax positions as the result of a settlement with tax authorities additionally operating cash flows decreased by 165 million yearoveryear due to the change in income taxes payable which was partially offset by an increase in operating cash flows of 81 million from the change in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2013 increased 1130 million compared to fiscal 2012 net income plus the noncash impact of depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of 2427 million in fiscal 2013 compared to 1995 million in fiscal 2012 an increase of 432 million the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a source of cash of 239 million in fiscal 2013 compared to a use of cash of 224 million in fiscal 2012 this change was attributable to faster inventory turns and a reduction in consolidated inventories on a perstore basis including the distribution centers which was down 6 at the end of fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 excluding stp the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash by 269 million in fiscal 2013 versus 14 million in fiscal 2012 which was primarily driven by an increase in accrued incentive compensation and accrued pension additionally operating cash flows increased by 48 million yearoveryear due to the change in deferred income tax provision and income taxes payable which was largely offset by a reduction in operating cash flows of 47 million due to an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses the increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to the timing of rental payments 

we have a reserve for the remaining future obligations of operations we have closed sold or otherwise disposed of including among others bob’s stores and aj wright the majority of these obligations relate to real estate leases associated with these operations the reserve balance was 314 million at february 1 2014 and 452 million at february 2 2013 the cash flows required to satisfy obligations of former operations are classified as a reduction in cash provided by operating activities see note c to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

  

investing activities our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below 

 

 we expect that we will spend approximately 975 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 including approximately 466 million for our offices and distribution centers including buying and merchandising systems and information systems to support growth 299 million for store renovations and 210 million for new stores we plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds 

we also purchased shortterm investments that had initial maturities in excess of 90 days which per our policy are not classified as cash on the consolidated balance sheets presented in fiscal 2014 we purchased 478 million of such shortterm investments compared to 356 million in fiscal 2013 additionally 387 million of such shortterm investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2014 compared to 213 million last year 

investing activities for fiscal 2013 also included the net cash paid in december 2012 for the acquisition of stp an offprice internet retailer during fiscal 2014 after customary postclosing adjustments the estimated purchase price was reduced by 3 million the final purchase price net of cash acquired was 188 million see note b to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

financing activities cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 1144 million in fiscal 2014 1476 million in fiscal 2013 and 1336 million in fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2014 we issued 500 million of 25 tenyear notes generating proceeds net of debt issuance expenses and fees of 495 million see note k to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

tjx repurchased and retired 270 million shares of its common stock at a cost of 15 billion during fiscal 2014 on a “trade date basis” tjx reflects stock repurchases in its financial statements on a “settlement date” or cash basis under our stock repurchase programs we spent 1471 million to repurchase 273 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2014 1345 million to repurchase 320 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2013 and 1321 million to repurchase 484 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2012 see note e to the consolidated financial statements for more information in january 2014 our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional 20 billion of tjx stock we currently plan to repurchase approximately 16 billion to 17 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2015 we determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow liquidity economic and market conditions our assessment of prospects for our business legal requirements and other factors the timing and amount of these purchases may change 

we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 058 per share in fiscal 2014 046 per share in fiscal 2013 and 038 per share in fiscal 2012 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 394 million in fiscal 2014 324 million in fiscal 2013 and 275 million in fiscal 2012 we also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 146 million in fiscal 2014 134 million in fiscal 2013 and 219 million in fiscal 2012 we expect to pay quarterly dividends for fiscal 2015 of 0175 per share or an annual dividend of 070 per share subject to the declaration and approval of our board of directors this would represent a 21 increase over the per share dividends declared and paid for fiscal 2014 

we traditionally have funded our working capital requirements including for seasonal merchandise primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented as needed by shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper as of february 1 2014 our cash and cash equivalents held outside the us were 11 billion of which 3952 million was held in countries where we have the intention to reinvest any 

  

undistributed earnings indefinitely we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents internally generated funds and our credit facilities described in note k to the consolidated financial statements are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year 

contractual obligations as of february 1 2014 we had known contractual obligations including current installments under longterm debt arrangements operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows in thousands 

 

  

  

  

 we also have longterm liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include 3348 million for employee compensation and benefits and 502 million for uncertain tax positions 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to the areas described below 

inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory for all our businesses except stp under the retail method which results in a weighted average cost the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced typically a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns however as a normal business practice we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end thus actual and estimated amounts of shrinkage may differ in quarterly results but the difference is typically not a significant factor in full year results we do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory 

impairment of longlived assets goodwill and tradenames we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets goodwill and tradenames at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores as well as of our business units which involve a number of factors including historical trends recent performance and general economic assumptions if we determine that an impairment of longlived assets has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets 

  

retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates we are required to make assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the longterm rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period the discount rate which we determine annually based on market interest rates and our estimated longterm rate of return which can differ considerably from actual returns can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan if our discount rate were decreased 25 percentage points our fiscal 2014 pension cost for our funded plan would have increased by approximately 6 million a change of 25 percentage points in our longterm rate of return would increase or decrease our fiscal 2014 pension cost by approximately 2 million when the discount rate market performance of our plan assets changes in tax or other benefits laws and regulations or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan our required contributions may increase we also consider these factors in determining the amount of voluntary contributions we may make to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements in fiscal 2014 we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of 30 million 

sharebased compensation in accordance with gaap we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan the fair value of the awards is amortized as “sharebased compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service we use the blackscholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results the use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost 

casualty insurance in fiscal 2013 our casualty insurance program was changed from a fixed premium program to a selfinsured program a selfinsured casualty insurance program requires us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost the estimated claims are developed with the assistance of an actuary based on historical experience and other factors these estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates if our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance for fiscal 2014 were to change by 5 the fiscal 2014 pretax cost would increase or decrease by approximately 3 million a large portion of these claims is funded with a nonrefundable payment during the policy year offsetting our estimated claims accrual we had a net accrual of 147 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of february 1 2014 

reserves for uncertain tax positions like many large corporations our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation assessment examination litigation and settlement the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain in accordance with gaap we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the positions we have taken will not be sustained however in the next twelve months and in future periods the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay as the result of the final resolutions of examinations judicial or administrative proceedings changes in facts law or legal interpretations expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of or changes in tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

reserves for former operations as discussed in note c to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the management’s discussion and analysis we have reserves for probable losses arising for future 

  

obligations of former operations primarily real estate leases we must make estimates and assumptions about the costs and expenses we will incur in connection with the future obligations of our former operations the leases relating to aj wright and other former operations are longterm obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including when and on what terms we will assign the leases or sublease the leased properties whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors including indemnification may exist to any liability we may have we develop these assumptions based on past experience and evaluation of various potential outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location actual results may differ from our current estimates and we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for future developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors although we do not expect any such differences to be material to our results of operations 

loss contingencies  certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our management with the assistance of our legal counsel assesses such contingent liabilities such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable 

recent accounting pronouncements 

tjx has reviewed recently issued accounting pronouncements and does not expect their adoption to have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flow

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend tjx is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business some potential market risks are discussed below 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the us dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between and among our domestic and international operations as more fully described in note f to our consolidated financial statements we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments primarily at our international operations and a portion of our intercompany transactions with and within our international operations we enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency as of february 1 2014 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pretax income for fiscal 2014 by approximately 68 million 

  

equity price and other market risk 

the assets of our funded qualified pension plan a large portion of which are equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets we invest the pension assets described further in note j to the consolidated financial statements in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties investments in general are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility risks a significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan which could result in increased required contributions to the plan or increase other planrelated liabilities our pension plan investment policy prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative purposes

in december 2012 we acquired sierra trading post an offprice online retailer of apparel and home fashions which we are maintaining as a separate banner 

flexible business model our flexible offprice business model including our opportunistic buying inventory management logistics and store layouts is designed to deliver our customers a compelling value proposition of fashionable quality brandname and designer merchandise at excellent values our buying and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than traditional retailers and the design and operation of our stores and distribution centers support this flexibility our merchants have more visibility into consumer fashion and market trends and pricing when we buy closer to need which can help us “buy smarter” and reduce our markdown exposure our selling floor space is flexible without walls between departments and largely free of permanent fixtures so we can easily expand and contract departments to accommodate the merchandise we purchase our logistics and distribution operations are designed to support our buying strategies and to facilitate quick efficient and differentiated delivery of merchandise to our stores with a goal of getting the right merchandise to the right stores at the right times 

opportunistic buying as an offprice retailer our buying practices which we refer to as opportunistic buying differentiate us from traditional retailers our overall opportunistic buying strategy is to acquire merchandise on an ongoing basis that will enable us to offer a desirable and rapidly changing mix of branded designer and other quality merchandise in our stores at prices below regular prices for comparable merchandise at department and specialty stores we seek out and select from the broad range of opportunities in the marketplace to achieve this end our buying organization which numbers over 800 individuals in 13 buying offices in ten countries executes this opportunistic buying strategy in a variety of ways depending on market conditions and other factors 

we take advantage of opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from the production and flow of inventory in the apparel and home fashions marketplace which include among others order cancellations manufacturer overruns closeouts and special production our buying strategies are intentionally flexible to allow us to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market and to adjust how and what we source as well as when we source it our goal is to operate with lean inventory levels compared to conventional retailers to give us the flexibility to seek out and to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise in contrast to traditional retailers which typically order goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor our merchants are in the marketplace frequently looking for opportunities to buy merchandise we buy much of our merchandise for the current or immediately upcoming selling season we also buy some merchandise which we refer to as “packaway” with the intention of storing it for sale in future selling seasons we generally make these packaway purchases in response to opportunities in the marketplace to buy merchandise that we believe has the right combination of brand fashion quality and price to supplement the product we expect to be available to purchase later for those future seasons we also develop some merchandise which we refer to as private label that is produced for us under inhouse and licensed brands we generally acquire this type of merchandise to supplement the depth of or fill gaps in our expected merchandise assortment 

our expansive vendor universe is in excess of 16000 consists primarily of manufacturers along with retailers and others and provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quality merchandise for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments and expect this will continue as we continue to grow we believe a number of factors make us an attractive outlet for the vendor community and provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise we are typically willing to purchase lessthanfull assortments of items styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large we are able to disperse merchandise across our 

  

geographically diverse network of stores and to target specific markets we pay promptly and we generally do not ask for typical retail concessions such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries or return privileges we provide vendors an outlet with financial strength and an excellent credit rating 

inventory management we offer our customers a rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a treasure hunt experience in our stores and spur customer visits to achieve this we seek to turn the inventory in our stores rapidly regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions at excellent values our specialized inventory planning purchasing monitoring and markdown systems coupled with distribution center storage processing handling and shipping systems enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local preferences and demographics achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of products and generally sell within the period we planned we make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations centrally using information provided by specialized computer systems designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner over the past several years we have been investing in our supply chain with the goal of continuing to operate with low inventory levels to ship more efficiently and quickly and to more precisely and effectively allocate merchandise to each store

 item 1a risk factors tableend the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks that follow individually or in the aggregate are those that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements 

failure to execute our opportunistic buying strategy and inventory management could adversely affect our business 

while our opportunistic buying strategy and our goals of operating with lean inventory levels and frequent inventory turns are key elements of our offprice business they subject us to risks related to the pricing quantity nature and timing of inventory flowing to our stores our merchants are in the marketplace frequently as much of our merchandise is purchased for the current or immediately upcoming season our opportunistic buying places considerable discretion in our merchants they react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market assess the desirability and value of merchandise and generally make determinations of how and what we source as well as when we source it if we do not obtain the right fresh desirable merchandise at the right times quantities and prices it could adversely affect traffic to our stores as well as our sales and margins 

we base our purchases of inventory in part on our sales forecasts if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory leading to decreased profit margins or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales either of which could adversely affect our financial performance 

if we are unable to generally purchase inventory at prices sufficiently below prices paid by conventional retailers to allow us to maintain our overall pricing differential to regular department and specialty stores our ability to attract customers and sustain our margins may be adversely affected we may not achieve this at various times or in some divisions or geographies which could adversely affect our results or those of one of our segments 

we must also properly execute our inventory management strategy of delivering the right product to the right stores at the right time we need to appropriately allocate merchandise among our stores timely and efficiently distribute inventory to stores maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory in each store appropriately change the allocation of floor space of stores among product categories to respond to customer demand and effectively manage pricing and markdowns there is no assurance we will be able to do so 

in addition to our own execution we may need to react to factors affecting inventory flow that are outside our control such as extreme weather and natural disasters or other changes in conditions affecting our vendors and others in our supply chain such as political instability labor issues including strikes or threats of strikes or increasing cost of regulations if we are not able to adjust appropriately to such factors our merchandise distribution may be affected failure to execute our opportunistic inventory buying and inventory management well could adversely affect our performance and our relationship with our customers 

failure to continue to expand our operations successfully or to manage our substantial size and scale effectively could adversely affect our financial results 

our revenue growth is dependent among other things on our ability to continue to expand through successfully opening new stores successful store growth requires us to lease appropriate real estate on 

  

attractive terms in each of the locations where we seek to open stores our ability to do so depends among other things on availability and selection of appropriate sites in appropriate geographies competition for sites factors affecting costs such as real estate construction and development costs as well as costs and availability of capital and variations in or changes to zoning or other land use regulations if we cannot lease appropriate sites on attractive terms it could limit our ability to successfully grow in various markets or adversely affect the economics of new stores in various markets further we may encounter difficulties in attracting customers when we enter new markets for a variety of reasons including customers’ lack of familiarity with our brands or our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences or cultural differences new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores and new and existing stores in a market may adversely affect each other’s sales and profitability 

further our substantial size imposes demands on maintaining appropriate internal resources and third party providers to support our business effectively and expansion places increased demands on management and the administrative merchandising store operations distribution compliance and other organizations in our businesses and we may not efficiently manage our business or successfully manage our growth in addition under our business model some aspects of the businesses and operations of our chains in the us canada and europe are conducted with relative autonomy the large size and scale of our operations our multiple chains in the us canada and europe and the autonomy afforded to the chains increase the risk that our systems and practices will not be implemented appropriately throughout our company and that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations which risks may increase as we continue to grow particularly in different countries if business information is not shared effectively or if we are otherwise unable to manage our growth effectively we may operate with decreased operational efficiency may need to reduce our rate of expansion of one or more operations or otherwise curtail growth in one or more markets which may adversely affect our success in executing our business goals and adversely impact our sales and results 

failure to identify customer trends and preferences to meet customer demand could negatively impact our performance 

because our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand we work to follow customer trends and preferences on an ongoing basis and to offer inventory that meets those trends and preferences however identifying consumer trends and preferences and successfully meeting customer demand across our diverse merchandise categories and in the many markets in the united states canada and europe in which we do business on a timely basis is challenging although our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer preferences and trends and to expand and contract merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes we may not successfully do so which could adversely affect our results 

our future performance is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand within our existing markets and to extend our offprice model in new product lines and geographic regions and businesses 

our growth strategy is to continue to successfully expand the number of stores in our existing markets to continue to successfully expand our existing chains to new markets and geographies and as appropriate to successfully develop or acquire new businesses including our planned expansion into ecommerce all of which entail significant risk there are significant risks associated with both our ability to continue to successfully extend our current business and to enter new businesses including managing the implementation of this growth effectively if any aspect of our expansion strategy does not achieve the success we expect in whole or in part we may be required to increase our investment slow our planned growth or close stores or operations and our growth and financial performance could be adversely affected 

if we fail to successfully implement our marketing advertising and promotional programs or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are our revenue may be adversely affected 

although we use marketing advertising and promotional programs to attract customers to our stores through various media including television social media database marketing print and direct marketing some of our competitors expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which 

  

may provide them with a competitive advantage our marketing advertising and promotional programs may not be effective or could require increased expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations we may need to adjust our marketing advertising and promotional programs effectively as internetbased and other digital or mobile communication channels rapidly evolve and there is no assurance that we will successfully do so 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive we compete with local regional national and international retailers that sell apparel home fashions and other merchandise we sell including in stores through catalogues or other media or over the internet some of our competitors are larger than we are or have more experience in selling certain product lines than we do new competitors frequently enter the market and existing competitors enter or increase their presence in the markets in which we operate expand their merchandise offerings or change their pricing methods all of which increase competition for customers we compete on the basis of fashion quality price value merchandise selection and freshness brandname recognition service reputation and store location our competitiveness is highly dependent on our effective execution of our offprice model of offering the customer a fresh rapidly changing and attractive mix of merchandise delivering value the demand for our merchandise is also influenced by our advertising marketing and promotional activities the name recognition and reputation of our chains and the location of and service offered in our stores if we fail to compete effectively our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 

failure to attract train and retain quality associates in appropriate numbers including management buying sales distribution center and other personnel and increased costs from our existing or expanding labor force could adversely affect our performance 

our performance depends on recruiting developing training and retaining quality sales systems distribution center and other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel 

many of our associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover availability and skill of associates may differ across markets in which we do business and in new markets we enter and our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs including costs of retirement health and other employee benefits is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates minimum wage legislation changing demographics economic conditions health care legislation health and other insurance costs and governmental labor and employment and employee benefits requirements the nature of the workforce in the retail industry also subjects us to the risk of immigration law violations which risk has increased in recent years certain associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions of various kinds as well as risks and potential expenses associated with multiemployer plans including from potential withdrawal liability and potential insolvency of other participating employers and other associates are members of works councils which may subject us to additional actions or expense in addition any failure of thirdparties that perform services on our behalf to comply with immigration employment or other laws could damage our reputation or disrupt our ability to obtain needed labor in the event of increasing wage rates in a market failure to increase our wages competitively could result in a decline in the quality of our workforce causing our customer service to suffer while increasing our wages could cause our earnings to decrease 

because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must provide significant internal training and development for key associates including within our buying organization similar to other retailers we face challenges in securing and retaining sufficient talent in management and other key areas for many reasons including competition in the retail industry generally and for talent in various geographic markets if we do not continue to attract qualified individuals train them in our business model support their development and retain them our performance could be adversely affected or our growth could be limited 

  

global economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

during the economic recession global financial markets experienced extreme volatility disruption and credit contraction which adversely affected global economic conditions renewed financial turmoil in the financial and credit markets or other changes in economic conditions could adversely affect sources of liquidity available to us or our costs of capital and could adversely affect plan asset values and investment performance increasing our pension liabilities expenses and funding requirements with respect to companysponsored and multiemployer pension plans economic conditions both on a global level and in particular markets including unemployment decreased disposable income and actual and perceived wealth energy and health care costs interest and tax rates and policies weakness in the housing market volatility in capital markets decreased credit availability inflation and deflation as well as political or other factors beyond our control such as threats or possibilities of war terrorism global or national unrest actual or threatened epidemics and political instability also have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending consumer spending in turn affects retail sales these conditions and factors could adversely affect discretionary consumer spending and although we believe our flexible offprice model helps us respond they may adversely affect our sales cash flows and results of operations and performance 

compromises of our data security could materially harm our reputation and business 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store certain personal information from individuals such as our customers and associates and we process customer payment card and check information 

we suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions such intrusion or intrusions collectively the “computer intrusion” into portions of our computer system that process and store information related to customer transactions discovered late in 2006 in which we believe customer data were stolen we have taken steps designed to further strengthen the security of our computer system and protocols and have instituted an ongoing program with respect to data security consistent with a consent order with the federal trade commission to assess the ongoing effectiveness of our information security program and to maintain and enhance our program as appropriate nevertheless there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a future data compromise that unauthorized parties will not gain access to personal information or that any such data compromise or access will be discovered in a timely way 

we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential information further the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk are determined and controlled by the payment card industry not by us this is also true for check information and approval computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer system and if successful misappropriate personal information payment card or check information or confidential business information of our company in addition our associates contractors or third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to misappropriate such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology new tools and other developments may increase the risk of such a breach 

compromise of our data security or of third parties with whom we do business failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business information and delays in detecting any such compromise or loss could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and customers’ willingness to shop in our stores violate applicable laws regulations orders and agreements and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material 

failure to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information systems data centers and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including to process and record transactions in our stores to enable effective communication systems to plan and track inventory flow to manage logistics and to generate performance and financial reports we are dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and 

  

related backup systems our computer systems and the third party systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches cyberattacks catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our associates or contractors although we seek to maintain our systems effectively and to successfully address the risk of compromises of the integrity security and consistent operations of our systems we may not be successful in doing so compromises interruptions or shutdowns of our systems including those managed by third parties could lead to delays in our business operations and if significant or extreme affect our results of operations 

we modify update and replace our systems and infrastructure from time to time including adding new data centers replacing or updating legacy programs converting to global systems integrating new service providers such as for cloud computing technologies adding additional functionality such as for the development of our ecommerce business and adding new systems when we acquire new businesses we also modify and change our procedures for and add and change vendors who assist us with designing implementing and maintaining our systems and infrastructure although we believe we are diligent in selecting systems vendors and procedures to enable us to maintain the integrity of our systems and infrastructure when we modify them there are inherent risks associated with managing and changing systems infrastructure and relationships and with acquisitions including accurately capturing and maintaining data realizing the expected benefit of the change and potentially disrupting the operation of the systems as the changes are implemented additionally potential issues associated with implementing technology initiatives and the time and resources required to optimize the benefits of new systems could reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term 

the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends upon these information systems including our ability to operate and maintain them effectively and to select and implement appropriate new technologies systems controls data centers and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems and the third party systems we rely on to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm our profitability 

as our business is subject to seasonal influences a decrease in sales or margins during the second half of the year could have a disproportionately adverse affect on our operating results 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we generally realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the year which includes the backtoschool and yearend holiday seasons any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations 

adverse or unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate or our distribution centers are located could adversely affect our operating results 

both adverse and unseasonable weather such as storms severe cold or heat or unseasonable temperatures affect customers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop certain categories or at all and accordingly can adversely affect the demand for the merchandise in our stores particularly in apparel and seasonal merchandise  weather can also affect our ability to transport merchandise to our stores from our distribution and shipping centers or elsewhere in our supply chain as a result adverse or unseasonable weather in our markets could adversely affect our sales increase markdowns and adversely affect our operating results 

our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic events 

unforeseen public health issues such as pandemics and epidemics as well as natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other extreme weather and climate conditions in any of our markets could disrupt our operations or the operations of one or more of our vendors or of our supply chain or could severely damage or destroy one or more of our stores or distribution facilities located in the affected areas daytoday operations particularly our ability to receive products from our vendors or transport products to our stores could be adversely affected or we could be required to close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by affected distribution centers for a short or extended period of time as a result our business could be adversely affected 

  

damage to our corporate reputation or those of our banners could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

we believe that building the brand reputation of our retail banners is an important part of our marketing efforts and we expend resources building relationships with our customers through social media and other advertising and promotional activities our reputation is based in part on perceptions of subjective qualities so incidents involving us or our merchandise that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business particularly if the incidents result in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry similarly information posted about us our banners and the merchandise we sell including our private label brands on social media platforms and similar venues including blogs websites and other forums for internetbased communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons may adversely affect our reputation and brand even if the information is inaccurate the reputation of our company and our retail banners may be damaged by adverse events at the corporate level or by adverse events at our other banners damage to the reputation of our company and our banners could result in declines in customer loyalty and sales affect our vendor relationships development opportunities and associate retention and otherwise adversely affect our business 

issues with merchandise quality or safety could damage our reputation sales and financial results 

various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we sell to consumers regulations and standards in this area including those related to the us consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 state regulations like california’s proposition 65 and similar legislation in other countries in which we operate impose restrictions and requirements on the merchandise we sell in our stores and through ecommerce and change from time to time also new federal state provincial or local regulations in the us and other countries that may affect our business are contemplated and enacted with some regularity if we are unable to comply with regulatory requirements on a timely basis or at all or to adequately monitor new regulations that may apply to existing or new merchandise categories or in new geographies significant fines or penalties could be incurred or we could have to curtail some aspects of our sales or operations which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results we rely on our vendors to provide quality merchandise that complies with applicable product safety laws and other applicable laws but they may not comply with their obligations to do so although our arrangements with our vendors frequently provide for indemnification for product liabilities the vendors may fail to honor those obligations to an extent we consider sufficient or at all issues with the quality and safety of merchandise particularly with food bath and body and children’s products or issues with the genuineness of merchandise regardless of our fault or customer concerns about such issues could cause damage to our reputation and could result in lost sales uninsured product liability claims or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs and regulatory civil or criminal fines or penalties any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

our expanding international operations may expose us to risks inherent in operating in new countries 

we have a significant retail presence in canada and europe and have established buying offices around the world and our goal is to continue to expand our operations into other international markets in the future it can be costly and complex to establish develop and maintain international operations and promote business in new international jurisdictions which may differ significantly from the us and other countries in which we currently operate in addition to facing risks similar to our us and current international operations such as with regulations such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act we face additional risks inherent in operating in new countries such as understanding the retail climate and trends local customs and competitive conditions and complying with new laws rules and regulations developing the appropriate infrastructure for local operations as well as financial risks including currency exchange fluctuations and adverse tax consequences or limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds outside of the country where earned which could have an adverse impact on our operations or profitability complying with applicable laws and our own internal policies may require us to spend additional time and resources to implement new procedures and financial controls conduct audits train associates and third parties on our compliance methods or take other actions which could adversely impact our operations 

  

we are subject to risks associated with importing merchandise from other countries 

many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a lesser extent by us in many countries outside of the country where the stores are located particularly southeastern asia where we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those imposed upon the manufacturer of such products we are subject to the various risks of importing merchandise from other countries and purchasing product made in other countries such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates labor conditions transport capacity and costs systems issues problems in third party distribution and warehousing and other interruptions of the supply chain compliance with laws and regulations and other factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise beyond our control could affect the availability and the price of our inventory furthermore although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to operating in nonus jurisdictions and importing merchandise there can be no assurance that contractors agents vendors or other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our operations or operating results 

our results may be adversely affected by reduced availability or increases in the price of oil or other fuels raw materials and other commodities 

energy and fuel costs have fluctuated dramatically and had significant cost increases in the past particularly the price of oil and gasoline an increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers although we have implemented a hedging strategy designed to manage a portion of our transportation costs that strategy may not be effective or sufficient and increases in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs which could have an adverse effect on our performance increased regulation related to environmental costs including cap and trade or other emissions management systems could also adversely affect our costs of doing business including utility costs transportation and logistics 

similarly other commodity prices can fluctuate dramatically such as the cost of cotton and synthetic fabrics which at times have risen significantly such increases can increase the cost of merchandise which could adversely affect our performance through potentially reduced consumer demand or reduced margins 

fluctuations in currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and changes in currency exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into us dollars for financial reporting purposes because of this movements in currency 

  

exchange rates have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our consolidated and segment results from time to time changes in currency exchange rates can also increase the cost of inventory purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the business buying the merchandise when these changes occur suddenly it can be difficult for us to adjust retail prices accordingly and gross margin can be adversely affected a significant amount of merchandise we offer for sale is made in china and accordingly a revaluation of the chinese currency or increased market flexibility in the exchange rate for that currency increasing its value relative to the us dollar or currencies in which our stores are located could be significant 

additionally we routinely enter into inventoryrelated hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rates on merchandise margins of merchandise purchases by our divisions denominated in currencies other than their local currencies in accordance with gaap we evaluate the fair value of these hedging instruments and make marktomarket adjustments at the end of each accounting period these adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our earnings 

although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates we expect that currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations from time to time in addition fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our earnings and operating results if a counterparty to one of our hedging arrangements fails to perform 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate and may fall short of prior periods our projections or the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past and they may continue to do so in the future if we fail to increase our results over prior periods to achieve our projected results or goals or to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline and the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance results may be affected by factors we can control such as the execution of our offprice buying including selection pricing and mix of merchandise inventory management including flow pricing markon and markdowns and management of our growth but also may be affected by some factors that are not within our control including actions of competitors weather conditions economic conditions consumer confidence seasonality and cost increases due for example to government regulation and increased healthcare and benefits costs most of our operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not vary directly with the amount of our sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term as a result if sales in a particular quarter are below our expectations for that quarter we generally are not able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter resulting in a disproportionate effect on our net income for the quarter we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to project sales and align expenses if we do not control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results or if actual results differ significantly from our forecast our financial performance could be adversely affected in addition if we do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplated pursuant to our stock repurchase programs our earnings per share may be adversely affected 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions or investments in new businesses or divest close or consolidate any of our current businesses our business will be subject to additional risks 

we may acquire new businesses as in our recent acquisition of sierra trading post invest in or enter into joint ventures with other businesses develop new businesses internally and divest close or consolidate businesses acquisition investment or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses and we may not effectively evaluate target companies or investments or assess the risks benefits and cost of buying investing in or closing businesses or of the integration of acquired businesses all of which can be difficult timeconsuming and dilutive acquisitions investments closings and divestitures may not meet our performance and other expectations or may expose us to unexpected or greaterthanexpected costs liabilities and risks divestitures closings and consolidations also involve risks such as 

  

significant costs and obligations of closure including exposure on leases owned real estate and other contractual employment pension and severance obligations and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer failure to execute on mergers acquisitions investments divestitures closings and consolidations in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 

failure to comply with existing laws regulations and orders or changes in existing laws and regulations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

we are subject to federal state provincial and local laws rules and regulations in the united states and other countries any of which may change from time to time as well as orders and assurances these legal regulatory and administrative requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business from cost of health care and retirement benefits workforce management logistics marketing importexport sourcing and manufacturing data protection and others if we fail to comply with these laws rules regulations and orders we may be subject to fines or other penalties which could materially adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition further applicable accounting principles and interpretations may change from time to time and the changes could have material effects on our reported financial results and condition 

we must also comply with new and changing laws and regulations new legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms in jurisdictions where we do business could increase our costs of compliance or of doing business and could adversely affect our operating results including those involving 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation legal proceedings and other legal matters 

we are involved or may in the future become involved in legal proceedings regulatory reviews and audits these may involve inquiries investigations law suits and other proceedings by local provincial state and federal governmental entities in the united states and other countries and private plaintiffs including with respect to tax escheat whistleblower claims employment and employee benefits including classification employment rights discrimination wage and hour and retaliation securities disclosure real estate tort consumer protection product safety advertising and intellectual property there continue to be a number of employmentrelated lawsuits including class actions in the united states and we are subject to these types of suits we cannot predict the results of legal and regulatory proceedings with certainty and actual results may differ from any reserves we establish estimating the probable outcome regardless of merit or outcome litigation can be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expense and diversion of management attention legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations could expose us to significant defense costs fines penalties and liability to private parties and governmental entities for monetary recoveries and other amounts and attorneys’ fees andor require us to change aspects of our operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including the results of tax audits and examinations income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory income tax rates changes in income tax rates changes in transfer pricing changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities 

  

changes in applicable tax legislation regulations and treaties exposure to additional tax liabilities including interest and penalties and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters any of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision and accruals for taxes and actual results may differ from our estimations 

we are subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state provincial and local tax authorities in the us and foreign countries and the examining authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various proceedings with such authorities and in court with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these proceedings to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of our provision for income taxes and increase and decrease our provision as a result of these assessments however the developments in and actual results of proceedings or the result of rulings by or settlements with tax authorities and courts or due to changes in facts law or legal interpretations expiration of applicable statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions could differ from the amounts we have accrued for such proceedings in either a positive or a negative manner which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations 

in addition we are subject to tax audits and examinations for payroll value added salesbased and other taxes relating to our businesses 

our real estate leases generally obligate us for long periods which subjects us to financial risks 

we lease virtually all of our store locations generally for an initial terms of ten years with options to renew the term and either own or lease for long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices accordingly we are subject to the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate which can adversely affect our results as for example was the case in the closure of various of our former operations while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions including by making specified payments we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so if we decide to close stores we are generally required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases which generally includes among other things paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or paying to exercise rights to terminate and the performance of any of these obligations may be expensive when we assign leases or sublease space to third parties we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform in addition when the lease term for the stores in our ongoing operations expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close stores or to relocate stores within a market on less favorable terms 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our operations growth stock repurchases and dividends and interest and debt repayment 

our business depends upon our operations to continue to generate strong cash flow to supply capital to support our general operating activities to fund our growth and our return to stockholders through our stock repurchase programs and dividends and to pay our interest and debt repayments our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities to repatriate cash from our international operations in a manner that is cost effective could adversely affect our growth plans and financial performance including our earnings per share we borrow on occasion to finance our activities and if financing were not available to us in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed it could also adversely affect our financial performance

overview 

the tjx companies inc is the largest offprice retailer of apparel and home fashions in the us and worldwide our over 3000 stores offer a rapidly changing assortment of quality fashionable brandname and designer apparel home fashions and other merchandise at prices generally 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices every day we operate our business in four divisions marmaxx which operates tj maxx and marshalls and homegoods both in the united states tjx canada which operates winners homesense and marshalls in canada and tjx europe which operates tk maxx and homesense in europe 

fiscal 2013 was another record year for us highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2013 include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

 the following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results followed by a discussion of our segment operating results 

net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal 2013 totaled 259 billion a 12 increase over 232 billion in fiscal 2012 the increase reflected a 7 increase from same store sales a 3 increase from new stores and a 2 increase from the impact of the 53 rd week in the fiscal 2013 calendar foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2013 net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012 totaled 232 billion a 6 increase over 219 billion in fiscal 2011 the increase reflected a 5 increase from new stores a 4 increase from same store sales and a 1 increase from foreign currency exchange rates offset in part by a 4 decrease due to the elimination of sales from stores operating under the aj wright banner the fiscal 2012 sales from the converted aj wright stores are included in new store sales 

same store sales increases in the us for fiscal 2013 were driven by an increase in customer traffic and to a lesser extent an increase in the value of the average transaction sales of both apparel and home fashions were equally strong geographically same store sales increases in the us were strong throughout most regions with florida and the southwest performing above the consolidated average and virtually all other regions close to the consolidated average our foreign segments both posted same store sales increases with tjx europe above the consolidated average and tjx canada below the consolidated average 

same store sales increases in the us for fiscal 2012 reflected an increase in both the value of the average transaction and an increase in customer traffic same store sales of our home dresses men’s shoes and accessories categories were particularly strong geographically same store sales increases in the us were strong throughout most regions with florida and the southwest performing above the consolidated average and the midwest trailing the consolidated average for the full fiscal year 2012 the same store sales increase for tjx europe was well below the consolidated average and same store sales at tjx canada decreased from the prior year but both europe and canada posted strong same store sales gains in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 

we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated on a 

  

constant currency basis meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance we define customer traffic to be the number of transactions in stores included in the same store sales calculation 

the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales on an as reported and as adjusted basis 

 

   

 impact of foreign currency exchange rates  our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies two ways in which foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results are as follows 

 

  

 cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 716 in fiscal 2013 727 in fiscal 2012 and 731 in fiscal 2011 the 11 percentage point improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2013 was primarily due to improved merchandise margins driven by lower markdowns as well as expense leverage on the strong same store sales increase in addition the 53 rd week in fiscal 2013 benefitted this expense ratio by approximately 02 percentage points 

  

the improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2012 was due to expense leverage on buying and occupancy costs particularly at marmaxx and homegoods partially offset by a decrease in merchandise margins at tjx europe and tjx canada 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 164 in fiscal 2013 168 in fiscal 2012 and 169 in fiscal 2011 on an adjusted basis this ratio was 165 in fiscal 2012 and 163 in fiscal 2011 the improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2013 was primarily due to expense leverage on strong same store sales partially offset by contributions to the tjx foundation and by expenses related to two third quarter items a noncash charge for the cumulative impact of a correction to our pension accrual for prior years and a nonoperating charge due to the adjustment in our reserve for former operations relating to closed stores 

the increase in the adjusted selling general and administrative expense ratio in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was driven by increased general corporate expenses primarily investment in new systems talent and ecommerce costs associated with a voluntary retirement program and fourth quarter charges and writeoffs at tjx canada and tjx europe see segment discussions below offset in part by expense leverage on strong same store sales particularly at homegoods 

interest expense net the components of interest expense net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

 

 gross interest expense has remained fairly constant over the last three fiscal years the reduction in our net interest expense position in both fiscal 2013 and in fiscal 2012 was due to capitalized interest on major capital projects that have not yet been placed in service 

income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was 380 in fiscal 2013 380 in fiscal 2012 and 381 in fiscal 2011 tjx’s effective rate remained constant for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 the fiscal 2013 effective tax rate benefitted from an increase in foreign earnings which are taxed at lower rates but this benefit was offset by the absence of the benefit in fiscal 2012 due to a net reduction in federal and state tax reserves the decrease in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is primarily attributable to a reduction in the fiscal 2012 tax reserves related to the favorable resolution of us federal tax audits partially offset by an increase in state and us federal tax reserves for a net decrease in the provision 

income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations income from continuing operations was 19 billion in fiscal 2013 a 27 increase over 15 billion in fiscal 2012 which in turn was a 12 increase over 13 billion in fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share were 255 in fiscal 2013 193 in fiscal 2012 and 165 in fiscal 2011 

fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share included an approximate 008 per share benefit due to the impact of the 53 rd week in the fiscal 2013 calendar adjusted diluted earnings per share were 199 for fiscal 2012 and 175 for fiscal 2011 see adjusted financial measures 

foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial impact on earnings per share in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 but benefitted fiscal 2012 earnings per share by 001 per share compared with a 001 per share negative impact in fiscal 2011 

in addition our weighted average diluted shares outstanding affect the comparability of earnings per share our stock repurchases benefit our earnings per share we repurchased 306 million shares of our stock at a cost of 13 billion in fiscal 2013 497 million shares of our stock at a cost of 14 billion in fiscal 2012 and 551 million shares at a cost of 12 billion in fiscal 2011 

  

discontinued operations and net income  in fiscal 2011 we had a net gain from discontinued operations reflecting an aftertax benefit of 36 million which did not impact diluted earnings per share as a result of a 6 million pretax reduction of the estimated cost of settling leaserelated obligations of former businesses net income which includes the impact of these discontinued operations was 19 billion or 255 per share for fiscal 2013 15 billion or 193 per share for fiscal 2012 and 13 billion or 165 per share for fiscal 2011 

adjusted financial measures in addition to presenting financial results in conformity with gaap we are also presenting certain measures on an “adjusted” basis we adjusted them to exclude 

 

  

 these adjusted financial results are nongaap financial measures we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial results provides additional information on comparisons between periods including underlying trends of our business by excluding these items that affect overall comparability we use these adjusted measures in making financial operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance and our board of directors uses them in assessing our business and making compensation decisions nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap 

reconciliations of each of the adjusted financial measures to the financial measures in accordance with gaap for fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 are provided below 

 

  

   

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the costs to convert aj wright stores to other banners and to hold grand reopenings affected our marmaxx and homegoods segments in fiscal 2012 a reconciliation of adjusted segment margin a nongaap financial measure to segment margin as reported in accordance with gaap for each of these segments is as follows 

 

   

  

 segment information we operate four main business segments marmaxx tj maxx and marshalls and homegoods both operate stores in the united states our tjx canada segment operates our stores in canada winners homesense and marshalls and our tjx europe segment operates our stores in europe tk maxx and homesense aj wright ceased to be a segment following its consolidation late in fiscal 2013 we acquired sierra trading post stp an offprice internet retailer the results of stp are not material and have been included with our marmaxx segment we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest expense “segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities the terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales these measures of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 

  

presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments 

us segments 

marmaxx 

 

  

 at february 2 2013 stp operated 4 stores with a selling square footage of 83000 

net sales at marmaxx increased 11 in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 same store sales for marmaxx were up 6 in fiscal 2013 on top of a 5 increase in the prior year same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2013 was driven by an increase in customer traffic with both apparel and home fashions posting solid same store sales gains geographically same store sales were strong throughout the country 

same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2012 was driven by a balanced increase in the value of the average transaction and an increase in customer traffic the categories that posted particularly strong same store sales increases in fiscal 2012 were dresses men’s shoes and accessories geographically same store sales increases were strong throughout the country with florida and the southwest the strongest and the midwest below the chain average 

segment margin was up 11 percentage points to 146 for fiscal 2013 compared to 135 for fiscal 2012 this increase was primarily due to a 06 percentage point improvement in merchandise margin largely due to lower markdowns the fiscal 2013 segment margin also benefitted from expense leverage particularly occupancy costs which improved by 04 percentage points on strong same store sales growth and the 53 rd week which lifted the fiscal 2013 segment margin by approximately 02 percentage points 

segment margin was up 02 percentage points to 135 for fiscal 2012 compared to 133 for fiscal 2011 primarily due to expense leverage particularly occupancy costs which improved by 03 percentage points on strong same store sales growth this improvement was offset in part by slightly lower merchandise margins and the store conversion and grand reopening costs of former aj wright stores converted to tj maxx or marshalls adjusted segment profit margin which excludes the aj wright conversion costs increased 03 percentage points to 136 for fiscal 2012 

we believe our ongoing store remodel program has benefited our sales in this segment as a result of the remodel program and our new store openings approximately 75 of tj maxx and marshall’s stores were in the new prototype at the end of fiscal 2013 

in fiscal 2014 we expect to open approximately 75 new marmaxx stores net of closings and increase selling square footage by approximately 3 

  

homegoods 

 

  homegoods’ net sales increased 18 in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 on top of a 15 increase in fiscal 2012 when compared to fiscal 2011 same store sales increased 7 in fiscal 2013 on top of a same store sales increase of 6 in fiscal 2012 same store sales growth was driven by an increase in customer traffic and to a lesser extent an increase in the value of the average transaction in both years segment profit margin for fiscal 2013 was 122 up from 104 for fiscal 2012 the increase was driven by expense leverage on the 7 same store sales increase particularly occupancy and administrative costs and an increase in merchandise margins segment profit margin for fiscal 2012 was 104 up from 95 for fiscal 2011 the increase was due to expense leverage on the same store sales increase and an increase in merchandise margins primarily due to lower markdowns partially offset by the conversion and grand reopening costs of former aj wright stores converted to homegoods adjusted segment profit margin for fiscal 2012 which excludes the aj wright conversion costs increased 11 percentage points to 106 

in fiscal 2014 we plan a net increase of approximately 30 homegoods stores and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 7 

aj wright 

we completed the consolidation of the aj wright division in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 closing the remaining stores not being converted to other banners these closing costs primarily leaserelated obligations and aj wright operating losses totaled 493 million and were reported as an aj wright segment loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 

in fiscal 2011 aj wright had a segment loss of 1300 million on net sales of 8884 million a majority of the costs related to the closing of aj wright were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 the fiscal 2011 segment loss includes a fourth quarter loss of 1406 million 

due to the anticipated migration of aj wright customers to our other us segments aj wright was not treated as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes 

  

international segments 

tjx canada 

 

 net sales for tjx canada increased 9 in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 currency translation negatively impacted sales growth by 1 percentage point in fiscal 2013 as compared to the same period last year same store sales increased 5 in fiscal 2013 compared to a decrease of 1 in fiscal 2012 

segment profit for fiscal 2013 increased to 4149 million and segment profit margin increased 12 percentage points to 142 the improvement in segment margin was driven by increased merchandise margin largely due to lower markdowns this increase in segment margin was partially offset by increased incentive compensation accruals in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 foreign currency translation and the marktomarket adjustment on inventory related hedges did not have a significant impact on fiscal 2013 segment profit and segment margin 

net sales for tjx canada increased 7 in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 currency translation benefitted fiscal 2012 sales growth by approximately 4 percentage points as compared to the same period in fiscal 2011 same store sales decreased 1 in fiscal 2012 compared to an increase of 4 in fiscal 2011 largely due to execution issues in women’s and to a lesser extent children’s categories 

segment profit for fiscal 2012 decreased to 3480 million due to weak sales volume in the first three quarters mitigated in part by strong inventory and expense management and to a lesser extent a fourth quarter charge of 6 million for the closure of our stylesense stores these decreases in segment profit more than offset a 10 million benefit from foreign currency translation and a 4 million benefit from marktomarket adjustment on inventoryrelated hedges the decrease in segment margin for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was due to expense deleverage and lower merchandise margins which more than offset the favorable change in the marktomarket adjustment of our inventoryrelated hedges 

  

we expect to add a net of approximately 20 stores in canada in fiscal 2014 and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 6 

tjx europe 

 

 net sales for tjx europe increased 14 in fiscal 2013 to 33 billion compared to 29 billion in fiscal 2012 currency translation negatively impacted fiscal 2013 sales growth by 2 percentage points fiscal 2013 same store sales increased 10 compared to an increase of 2 in fiscal 2012 

segment profit more than tripled to 2157 million for fiscal 2013 and segment profit margin increased to 66 the improvements we saw in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 in this segment’s performance as we slowed growth and refocused on offprice fundamentals continued throughout fiscal 2013 more than half of the improvement in segment margin came from improved merchandise margins which was virtually all due to lower markdowns segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2013 as compared to 2012 benefitted from the absence of the fiscal 2012 charges for closing an office facility and the writeoff of certain technology systems and other adjustments the impact of foreign currency translation and the marktomarket adjustment on inventoryrelated hedges was immaterial for fiscal 2013 

net sales for tjx europe increased 16 in fiscal 2012 to 29 billion compared to 25 billion in fiscal 2011 currency translation benefited fiscal 2012 sales growth by 4 percentage points same store sales were up 2 in fiscal 2012 compared to a decrease of 3 in fiscal 2011 tjx europe ended fiscal 2012 by posting a fourth quarter same store sales increase of 10 

segment profit decreased to 687 million for fiscal 2012 and segment profit margin decreased to 24 for fiscal 2012 the impact of foreign currency translation and the marktomarket adjustment on inventoryrelated hedges was immaterial our fiscal 2012 results reflect aggressive markdowns primarily taken in the first quarter to clear inventory and adjust our merchandise mix and the charges and writeoffs referenced above despite these fourth quarter charges segment profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 nearly doubled reflecting the effects of the changes we made to address the execution issues that adversely affected fiscal 2011 and earlier parts of fiscal 2012 

  

we expect to add approximately 25 net stores in europe in fiscal 2014 and plan to increase selling square footage by approximately 6 

general corporate expense 

 

 general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling general and administrative expenses the increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2013 includes contributions to the tjx foundation an adjustment to our reserve for former operations and the acquisition costs of sierra trading post these items account for 56 million of the increase in general corporate expense in addition general corporate expense for fiscal 2013 includes increased incentive compensation accruals under our performancebased plans additional investments in systems and technology and additional costs related to the expansion of our home office facilities 

the increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2012 was primarily due to our investments in systems and technology talent and associate training expenses costs related to our ecommerce initiative and costs related to a fourth quarter voluntary retirement program and an executive separation agreement collectively these items accounted for approximately 40 million of the increase in general corporate expenses for fiscal 2012 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was 3046 million in fiscal 2013 1916 million in fiscal 2012 and 1976 million in fiscal 2011 the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2013 increased 1130 million compared to fiscal 2012 net income plus the noncash impact of depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of 2427 million in fiscal 2013 compared to 1995 million in fiscal 2012 an increase of 432 million the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a source of cash of 239 million in fiscal 2013 compared to a use of cash of 224 million in fiscal 2012 this change was attributable to faster inventory turns and a reduction in consolidated inventories on a perstore basis including the distribution centers which was down 6 at the end of fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 excluding sierra trading post the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities favorably impacted cash by 269 million in fiscal 2013 versus 14 million in fiscal 2012 which was primarily driven by an increase in accrued incentive compensation and accrued pension additionally operating cash flows increased by 48 million yearoveryear due to the change in deferred income tax provision and income taxes payable which was largely offset by a reduction in operating cash flows of 47 million due to an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses the increase in prepaid expenses was primarily due to the timing of rental payments 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2012 decreased 60 million compared to fiscal 2011 net income plus the noncash impact of depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of 1995 million in fiscal 2012 compared to 1897 million in fiscal 2011 an increase of 98 million the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of 224 million in fiscal 2012 compared to 48 million in fiscal 2011 the increase in inventory was in our distribution centers primarily due to higher packaway inventory as we continued to take advantage of market opportunities the average inventory in our stores at the end of fiscal 2012 was below fiscal 2011 levels the additional cash outlay for the net change in inventory and accounts payable is due to the timing of payments the impact of the changes in all other assets and liabilities which reduced operating cash flows by 77 million yearoveryear was more than offset by the favorable impact on cash flows of 94 million due to a higher deferred income tax provision 

we have a reserve for the remaining future obligations of operations we have closed sold or otherwise disposed of including among others bob’s stores and aj wright the majority of these obligations relate to 

  

real estate leases associated with these operations the reserve balance was 452 million at february 2 2013 and 454 million at january 28 2012 the cash flows required to satisfy obligations of former operations are classified as a reduction in cash provided by operating activities see note c to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

investing activities our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below 

 

 we expect that we will spend approximately 925 million to 950 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 including approximately 444 million for our offices and distribution centers including buying and merchandising systems and information systems to support growth 316 million for store renovations and 190 million for new stores we plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds 

we also purchased shortterm investments that had initial maturities in excess of 90 days which per our policy are not classified as cash on the balance sheets presented in fiscal 2013 we purchased 356 million of such shortterm investments compared to 152 million in fiscal 2012 additionally 213 million of such shortterm investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2013 compared to 133 million last year 

investing activities for fiscal 2013 also included the net cash paid in december 2012 for the acquisition of stp an offprice internet retailer the purchase price net of cash acquired was 190 million which is subject to customary postclosing adjustments see note b to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

financing activities cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 1476 million in fiscal 2013 1336 million in fiscal 2012 and 1224 million in fiscal 2011 

under our stock repurchase programs we spent 1300 million to repurchase 306 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2013 1370 million to repurchase 497 million shares in fiscal 2012 and 1201 million to repurchase 551 million shares in fiscal 2011 see note d to the consolidated financial statements for more information in february 2013 our board of directors authorized an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional 15 billion of tjx stock we currently plan to repurchase approximately 13 billion to 14 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2014 we determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow liquidity economic and market conditions our assessment of prospects for our business legal requirements and other factors the timing and amount of these purchases may change 

we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 046 per share in fiscal 2013 038 per share in fiscal 2012 and 030 per share in fiscal 2011 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 324 million in fiscal 2013 275 million in fiscal 2012 and 229 million in fiscal 2011 we also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 134 million in fiscal 2013 219 million in fiscal 2012 and 176 million in fiscal 2011 

we traditionally have funded our working capital requirements including for seasonal merchandise primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented as needed by shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents internally generated funds and our credit facilities described in note j to the consolidated financial statements are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year 

  

contractual obligations as of february 2 2013 we had known contractual obligations including current installments under longterm debt arrangements operating leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations as follows in thousands 

 

  

  

  

 we also have longterm liabilities for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid which include 3953 million for employee compensation and benefits and 2572 million for uncertain tax positions 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to the areas described below 

inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory which results in a weighted average cost under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory this method is widely used in the retail industry and we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other inventory accounting methods it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced typically a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns however as a normal business practice we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end thus actual and estimated amounts of shrinkage may differ in quarterly results but the difference is typically not a significant factor in full year results we do not generally enter into arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances that could ultimately affect the value of inventory 

impairment of longlived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores as well as of our business units which involve a number of factors including historical trends recent performance and general economic assumptions if we determine that an impairment of longlived assets has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets 

retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates 

  

we are required to make assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the longterm rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period the discount rate which we determine annually based on market interest rates and our estimated longterm rate of return which can differ considerably from actual returns can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan when the discount rate market performance of our plan assets changes in tax or other benefits laws and regulations or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan our required contributions may increase we also consider these factors in determining the amount of voluntary contributions we may make to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements in fiscal 2013 we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of 75 million 

sharebased compensation in accordance with gaap we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan the fair value of the awards is amortized as “sharebased compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service we use the blackscholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results the use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost 

reserves for uncertain tax positions like many large corporations our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation assessment examination litigation and settlement the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain in accordance with gaap we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the positions we have taken will not be sustained however in the next twelve months and in future periods the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay as the result of the final resolutions of examinations judicial or administrative proceedings changes in facts law or legal interpretations expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of or changes in tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued and may result in reductions to or additions to accruals refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

reserves for former operations as discussed in note c to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the management’s discussion and analysis we have reserves for probable losses arising for future obligations of former operations primarily real estate leases we must make estimates and assumptions about the costs and expenses we will incur in connection with the future obligations of our former operations the leases relating to aj wright and other former operations are longterm obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including when and on what terms we will assign the leases or sublease the leased properties whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors including indemnification may exist to any liability we may have we develop these assumptions based on past experience and evaluation of various potential outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location actual results may differ from our current estimates and we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for future developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors although we do not expect any such differences to be material to our results of operations 

loss contingencies  certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our 

  

management with the assistance of our legal counsel assesses such contingent liabilities such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend tjx is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business some potential market risks are discussed below 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the us dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between our domestic and international operations as more fully described in note e to our consolidated financial statements we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments primarily at our international operations and intercompany transactions with our international operations we enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency as of february 2 2013 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pretax income for fiscal 2013 by approximately 65 million 

equity price risk 

the assets of our qualified pension plan a large portion of which are equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets we invest the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties investments in general are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility risks a significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan resulting in increased contributions to the plan 

we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes

business overview 

the tjx companies inc tjx is the leading offprice apparel and home fashions retailer in the united states and worldwide our over 2900 stores offer a rapidly changing assortment of quality fashionable brandname and designer merchandise at prices generally 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices every day

 aj wright consolidation in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 we completed the consolidation of aj wright converting 90 of the aj wright stores to tj maxx marshalls or homegoods banners and closing the remaining 72 stores two distribution centers and home office we continue to serve the customer demographic previously targeted by aj wright through our other banners 

flexible business model our offprice business model is flexible particularly for a company of our size allowing us to react to market trends our opportunistic buying and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than traditional retailers and the design and operation of our stores and distribution centers support this flexibility by maintaining a liquid inventory position our merchants can buy close to need enabling them to buy into current market trends and take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace buying close to need gives us visibility into consumer and fashion trends and current pricing at the time we make our purchases helping us “buy smarter” and reduce our markdown exposure our selling floor space is flexible without walls between departments and largely free of permanent fixtures so we can easily expand and contract departments in response to customer demand as well as market and fashion trends our distribution facilities are designed to accommodate our methods of receiving and shipping broadly ranging quantities of product to our large store base quickly and efficiently 

opportunistic buying we are differentiated from traditional retailers by our opportunistic buying of quality fashionable brand name merchandise which permits us to buy into current trends and pricing we purchase the majority of our apparel inventory and a significant portion of our home fashion inventory opportunistically virtually all of our opportunistic purchases are made at discounts from initial wholesale prices our buying organization numbers over 700 and we operate 12 buying offices in nine countries in contrast to traditional retailers which typically order goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor our merchants are in the marketplace virtually every week they buy primarily for the current selling season and to a limited extent for a future selling season buying later in the inventory cycle than traditional retailers and using the flexibility of our stores to shift in and out of categories we are able to take advantage of opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from the routine flow of inventory in the highly fragmented apparel and home fashions marketplace such as order cancellations manufacturer overruns and special production we operate with lean inventory levels compared to conventional retailers to give ourselves the flexibility to take advantage of these opportunities 

we buy most of our inventory directly from manufacturers with some coming from retailers and other sources a small percentage of the merchandise we sell is private label merchandise produced for us by third parties our expansive vendor universe which is in excess of 15000 provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise we have not historically experienced difficulty in obtaining adequate amounts of quality inventory for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments and believe that we will continue to have adequate inventory as we continue to grow 

we believe a number of factors make us an attractive outlet for the vendor community and provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise we are typically willing to purchase lessthanfull assortments of items styles and sizes and quantities ranging from small to very large we are able to disperse inventory across our geographically diverse network of stores or to specific markets we pay promptly and we generally do not ask for typical retail concessions such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries or return privileges importantly we provide vendors an outlet with financial strength and an excellent credit rating 

  

inventory management we offer our customers a rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a “treasure hunt” experience in our stores and spur customer visits to achieve this we seek to turn the inventory in our stores rapidly regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions at excellent values our specialized inventory planning purchasing monitoring and markdown systems coupled with distribution center storage processing handling and shipping systems enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local preferences and demographics achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of products and sell substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods we make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations centrally using information provided by specialized computer systems designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner we do not generally engage in promotional pricing activity such as sales or coupons over the past several years we have improved our supply chain allowing us to reduce inventory levels and ship more efficiently and quickly we plan to continue to invest in our supply chain with the goal of more precisely and effectively allocating the right merchandise to each store and delivering it even more quickly and efficiently 

pricing our mission is to offer retail prices in our stores generally 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular retail prices through our opportunistic purchasing we are generally able to react to price fluctuations in the wholesale market to maintain our pricing gap relative to prices offered by other retailers for example in a time of rising inventory prices if conventional retailers increase retail prices to preserve merchandise margin we typically are able to increase our retail prices correspondingly while maintaining our value relative to conventional retailers and preserve our own merchandise margin if conventional retailers do not raise prices to pass rising inventory costs on to consumers we seek to buy inventory at prices that permit us to maintain our values relative to conventional retailers and sustain our merchandise margins 

low cost operations we operate with a low cost structure compared to many traditional retailers we focus aggressively on expenses throughout our business our advertising is focused on our banners rather than individual products and partially as a result our advertising budget as a percentage of sales remains low compared to traditional retailers we design our stores generally located in community shopping centers to provide a pleasant convenient shopping environment but relative to other retailers do not spend heavily on store fixtures additionally our distribution network is designed to run cost effectively we continue to pursue cost savings in our operations 

customer serviceshopping experience while we offer a selfservice format we train our store associates to provide friendly and helpful customer service and seek to staff our stores to deliver a positive shopping experience we typically offer customerfriendly return policies we accept a variety of payment methods including cash credit cards and debit cards in the us we offer a cobranded tjx credit card and a private label credit card both through a bank but do not own the customer receivables related to either program we plan to continue our program of renovating and upgrading stores across our banners which we believe has enhanced our customers’ shopping experience and has helped to drive sales 

distribution we operate distribution centers encompassing approximately 11 million square feet in four countries these centers are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model we ship substantially all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers as well as warehouses and shipping centers operated by third parties we shipped approximately 18 billion units to our stores during fiscal 2012

 item 1a risk factors 

the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks that follow individually or in the aggregate are those that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements 

failure to execute our opportunistic buying and inventory management could adversely affect our business 

we purchase the majority of our apparel inventory and much of our home inventory opportunistically with our buyers purchasing close to need establishing the treasure hunt nature of the offprice buying experience to drive traffic to the stores and to increase same store sales requires us to offer rapidly changing assortments of merchandise in our stores while opportunistic buying provides our buyers the ability to buy at desirable times and prices in the quantities we need and into market trends it places considerable discretion in our buyers subjecting us to risks related to the pricing quantity nature and timing of inventory flowing to our stores if we are unable to provide frequent replenishment of fresh high quality attractively priced merchandise in our stores it could adversely affect traffic to the stores as well as our sales and margins we base our purchases of inventory in part on our sales forecasts if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory leading to decreased profit margins or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales either of which could adversely affect our financial performance we need to purchase inventory sufficiently below conventional retail to maintain our pricing differential to regular department and specialty store prices and to attract customers and sustain our margins which we may not achieve at various times or in some divisions or geographies and which could adversely affect our results or those of one of our segments 

we must also properly execute our inventory management strategies by appropriately allocating merchandise among our stores timely and efficiently distributing inventory to stores maintaining an appropriate mix and level of inventory in stores appropriately changing the allocation of floor space of stores among product categories to respond to customer demand and effectively managing pricing and markdowns and there is no assurance we will be able to do so in addition to our own execution inventory flow may be adversely affected by factors outside our control such as extreme weather or natural disasters or other changes in conditions affecting our vendors and others in our supply chain such as political instability labor issues or increasing cost or regulations if we are not able to adjust appropriately to such factors our merchandise distribution may be affected failure to execute our opportunistic inventory buying and inventory management well could adversely affect our performance and our relationship with our customers 

failure to continue to expand our operations successfully or to manage our substantial size and scale effectively could adversely affect our financial results 

our revenue growth is dependent among other things on our ability to continue to expand successfully through successfully opening new stores as well as increasing the sales of our existing stores successful store growth requires acquisition and development of appropriate store real estate including availability and selection of appropriate sites in appropriate geographies and negotiation of acceptable terms competition for desirable sites increases in real estate construction and development costs variations in or changes to zoning or other land use regulations as well as costs and availability of capital could limit our ability to open new stores successfully in various markets or adversely affect the economics of new stores in various markets we may encounter difficulties in attracting customers when we enter new markets for various reasons including customers’ lack of familiarity with our brands or our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences or cultural differences new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores and new and existing stores in a market may adversely affect each other’s sales and profitability 

further expansion places significant demands on management and the administrative merchandising store operations distribution compliance and other organizations in our businesses and we may not successfully 

  

manage our growth under our business model some aspects of the businesses and operations of our chains in the us canada and europe are conducted with relative autonomy the large size and scale of our operations our multiple businesses in the us canada and europe and the autonomy afforded to the chains increase the risk that our systems and practices will not be implemented appropriately throughout our company and that information may not be appropriately shared across our operations which risks may increase as we continue to grow particularly in different countries if business information is not shared effectively or we are otherwise unable to manage our growth effectively we may operate with decreased operational efficiency may need to reduce our rate of expansion of one or more operations or otherwise curtail growth in one or more markets which may adversely affect our success in executing our business goals and adversely impact our sales and results 

failure to identify customer trends and preferences to meet customer demand could negatively impact our performance 

because our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand we work to follow customer trends and preferences on an ongoing basis and to buy inventory in response to those trends and preferences however identifying consumer trends and preferences in the diverse product lines and many markets in which we do business and successfully meeting customer demand across those lines and for those markets on a timely basis is challenging although our flexible business model allows us to buy close to need and in response to consumer preferences and trends and to expand and contract merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes we may not successfully do so which could adversely affect our results 

our future performance is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand within our existing markets and to extend our offprice model in new product lines banners and geographic regions 

our strategy is to continue to expand within existing markets to expand to new markets and geographies and to attract new customers in existing and new markets across demographics in addition to the risks associated with finding appropriate locations and managing our existing business effectively this growth strategy includes developing new ways to sell more or different categories of merchandise within our existing stores continued expansion of our existing chains in our existing markets and countries expansion of these chains to new markets and countries and development or acquisition of new banners or businesses including our planned expansion into ecommerce all of which entail significant risk our growth is dependent upon our ability to successfully extend our business in these ways and on managing the timing and implementation of our growth effectively if any aspect of our expansion strategy does not achieve the success we expect in whole or in part we may be required to increase our investment or close stores or operations unsuccessful expansion of our model could adversely affect growth and financial performance 

if we fail to successfully implement our marketing advertising and promotional programs or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are our revenue may be adversely affected 

although we use marketing advertising and promotional programs to attract customers to our stores through various media including print television social media database marketing and direct marketing some of our competitors expend more for their programs than we do or use different approaches than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to execute our marketing advertising and promotional programs effectively and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations in addition internetbased communication channels are evolving rapidly and we may not adjust our programs effectively to reflect the changing forms of social media and other methods of communication 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

the retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive we compete with many other local regional national and international retailers that sell apparel home fashions and other merchandise we sell whether in stores through catalogues or other media or over the internet some of our competitors are larger than we are have more experience in selling certain products or have greater financial resources than we do new competitors frequently enter the market and existing competitors enter or increase their presence in the 

  

markets in which we operate expand their merchandise offerings or change their pricing methods we compete on the basis of fashion quality price value merchandise selection and freshness brandname recognition service reputation and store location other competitive factors that influence the demand for our merchandise include our advertising marketing and promotional activities and the name recognition and reputation of our chains if we fail to compete effectively our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 

failure to attract train and retain quality sales distribution center and other associates in appropriate numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel could adversely affect our performance 

our performance depends on recruiting developing training and retaining quality sales systems distribution center and other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel many of our associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover availability and skill of associates may differ across markets in which we do business and as we enter new markets and our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates minimum wage legislation changing demographics health care reform health and other insurance costs and governmental labor and employment requirements the nature of the workforce in the retail industry also subjects us to the risk of immigration law violations which risk has increased in recent years and certain associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions in addition any failure of thirdparties that perform services on our behalf to comply with immigration employment or other laws could damage our reputation or disrupt our ability to obtain needed labor in the event of increasing wage rates in a market failure to increase our wages competitively could result in a decline in the quality of our workforce causing our customer service to suffer while increasing our wages could cause our earnings to decrease 

in addition because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must do significant internal training and development for key associates the market for retail management is highly competitive and similar to other retailers we face challenges in securing sufficient management talent if we do not continue to attract train and retain management personnel and other quality associates our performance could be adversely affected 

global economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

during the recent economic recession global financial markets experienced extreme volatility disruption and credit contraction which adversely affected global economic conditions renewed financial turmoil in the financial and credit markets could adversely affect our costs of capital and the sources of liquidity available to us and could increase our pension funding requirements economic conditions both on a global level and in particular markets including continued unemployment decreased disposable income and actual and perceived wealth high energy and health care costs interest and tax rates and policies weakness in the housing market volatility in capital markets and tighter credit as well as political or other factors beyond our control such as threats or possibilities of war terrorism global or national unrest actual or threatened epidemics and political or financial instability also have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending consumer spending in turn affects retail sales these conditions and factors could adversely affect discretionary consumer spending and although we benefit from being an offprice retailer may adversely affect our sales cash flows and results of operations and performance 

compromises of our data security could materially harm our reputation and business 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store certain personal information from individuals such as our customers and associates and we process customer payment card and check information 

we suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions such intrusion or intrusions collectively the “computer intrusion” into portions of our computer system that process and store information related to customer transactions discovered late in fiscal 2007 in which we believe customer data were stolen we have taken steps designed to further strengthen the security of our computer system and protocols and have instituted an ongoing program with respect to data security consistent with a consent order with the federal trade commission to assess the ongoing effectiveness of our information security program and to maintain and enhance our program as appropriate nevertheless there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a future data compromise that unauthorized parties will not gain access to personal information or that any such data compromise or access will be discovered in a timely way 

  

we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential information further the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk are determined and controlled by the payment card industry not by us this is also true for check information and approval computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer system and if successful misappropriate personal information payment card or check information or confidential business information of our company in addition our associates contractors or third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to misappropriate such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology new tools and other developments may increase the risk of such a breach 

compromise of our data security failure to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business information and delays in detecting any such compromise or loss could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and customers’ willingness to shop in our stores violate applicable laws regulations orders and agreements and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material 

failure to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

we rely extensively on various information systems data centers and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including to process and record transactions in our stores to enable effective communication systems to plan and track inventory flow and to generate performance and financial reports we are dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches cyberattacks catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our associates or contractors we incur expenses to maintain our systems and to address the risk of interruptions in service interruptions or shutdowns of our systems could lead to delays in our business operations and if significant or extreme affect our results of operations 

we modify and update our systems and infrastructure such as with new data centers replace or update legacy systems and may acquire new systems with additional functionality such as for the development of an ecommerce business although we believe we are diligent in selecting vendors systems and procedures to enable us to maintain the integrity of our systems we recognize that there are inherent risks associated with these modifications and acquisitions including accurately capturing and maintaining data realizing the expected benefit of the change and the possibility of system disruptions as the changes are implemented 

the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends upon these information systems including our ability to operate and maintain them effectively and to select and implement appropriate new technologies systems controls data centers and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm our profitability 

as our business is subject to seasonal influences a decrease in sales or margins during the second half of the year could have a disproportionately adverse affect on our operating results 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we generally realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the year which includes the backtoschool and yearend holiday seasons any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations 

adverse or unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate or our distribution centers are located could adversely affect our operating results 

both adverse and unseasonable weather affect customers’ buying patterns and willingness to shop and accordingly the demand for the merchandise in our stores particularly in seasonal apparel  severe weather can also affect our ability to transport merchandise to our stores from our distribution and shipping centers or 

  

elsewhere in our supply chain as a result unusually extreme or unseasonable weather in our markets such as snow ice or rain storms severe cold or heat or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures could adversely affect our sales increase markdowns and adversely affect our operating results 

our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic events 

unforeseen public health issues such as pandemics and epidemics as well as natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other extreme weather and climate conditions in any of our markets could disrupt our operations or the operations of one or more of our vendors or could severely damage or destroy one or more of our stores or distribution facilities located in the affected areas daytoday operations particularly our ability to receive products from our vendors or transport products to our stores could be adversely affected or we could be required to close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by affected distribution centers as a result our business could be adversely affected 

damage to our corporate reputation or those of our banners could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

we believe that building the brand reputation of our retail banners is an important part of our marketing efforts and we expend resources building relationships with our customers through our print marketing websites social media and other means we also develop private label brands for certain merchandise sold in our stores reputational value is based in part on perceptions of subjective qualities so isolated incidents involving us or our merchandise that erode trust or confidence could adversely affect our reputation and our business particularly if the incidents result in significant adverse publicity or governmental inquiry similarly information posted about us our banners or our merchandise including our private label brands on social media platforms and similar venues including blogs social media websites and other forums for internetbased communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons may adversely affect our reputation and brand even if the information is inaccurate damage to the perception or reputation of our company and our banners could result in declines in customer loyalty and sales affect our vendor relationships development opportunities and associate retention and otherwise adversely affect our business 

issues with merchandise quality or safety could damage our reputation sales and financial results 

various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we sell in our stores regulations and standards in this area including those related to the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 in the united states and similar legislation in other countries in which we operate change from time to time also new state or local regulations that may affect our business are contemplated and enacted with some regularity our inability to comply with regulatory requirements on a timely basis or at all could result in significant fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results we rely on our vendors to provide quality merchandise that complies with applicable product safety laws and other applicable laws but they may not comply with their contractual obligations with us to do so although our arrangements with our vendors frequently provide for indemnification for product liabilities the vendors may fail to honor those obligations to an extent we consider sufficient or at all issues with the quality and safety of merchandise particularly with food bath and body and children’s products or issues with the genuineness of merchandise  regardless of our fault or customer concerns about such issues could cause damage to our reputation and could result in lost sales uninsured product liability claims or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs and regulatory civil or criminal fines or penalties any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

our expanding international operations increasingly expose us to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions 

we have a significant retail presence in canada and europe and have established buying offices around the world and our goal as a global retailer is to continue to expand our operations into other international markets in the future in addition to facing risks similar to our us operations our foreign operations encounter risks inherent in foreign operations such as understanding the retail climate and trends local customs and competitive 

  

conditions in foreign markets complying with foreign laws rules and regulations as well as risks from foreign currency fluctuations adverse tax consequences or limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds which could have an adverse impact on our operations or profitability complying with foreign and us laws and our own internal policies may require us to spend additional time and resources to implement new procedures and financial controls conduct audits train associates and third parties on our compliance methods or take other actions which could adversely impact our operations 

we are subject to risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries 

many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a lesser extent by us in many foreign countries particularly southeastern asia where we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those imposed upon the manufacturer of such products we are subject to the various risks of importing merchandise from abroad and purchasing product made in foreign countries such as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates labor conditions transport capacity and costs systems issues problems in third party distribution and warehousing and other interruptions of the supply chain compliance with us and foreign laws and regulations and other factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise beyond our control could affect the availability and the price of our inventory furthermore although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad there can be no assurance that contractors agents vendors or other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our operations or operating results 

our results may be adversely affected by reduced availability or increases in the price of oil or other fuels raw materials and other commodities 

energy and fuel costs have fluctuated dramatically in the past particularly the price of oil and gasoline which have recently risen significantly an increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers although we have implemented a hedging strategy designed to manage a portion of our transportation costs increases in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs which could have an adverse effect on our performance increased regulation related to environmental costs including cap and trade or other emissions management systems could also affect the costs of doing business including utility costs transportation and logistics 

  

similarly other commodity prices can fluctuate dramatically such as the cost of cotton and synthetic fabrics which at times have risen significantly such increases can increase the cost of merchandise which could adversely affect our performance through potentially reduced consumer demand or reduced margins 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

in addition to our us businesses we operate stores in canada and europe and plan to continue to expand our international operations sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and changes in foreign exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into us dollars for financial reporting purposes because of this movements in exchange rates have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our consolidated and segment results from time to time 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates can also increase the cost of inventory purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the business when these changes occur suddenly it can be difficult for us to adjust retail prices accordingly and gross margin can be adversely affected a significant amount of merchandise we offer for sale is made in china and accordingly a revaluation of the chinese currency or increased market flexibility in the exchange rate for that currency increasing its value relative to the us dollar or currencies in which our stores are located could be particularly significant 

additionally we routinely enter into inventoryrelated hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins of merchandise purchased by our segments that is denominated in currencies other than their local currencies in accordance with gaap we evaluate the fair value of these hedging instruments and make marktomarket adjustments at the end of an accounting period these adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our earnings 

although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates we expect that foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations in addition fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our earnings and operating results if a counterparty to one of our hedging arrangements fails to perform 

our quarterly operating results fluctuate and may fall short of prior periods our projections or the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could adversely affect our stock price 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past and they may continue to do so in the future the public trading of our stock is based in large part on market expectations that our business will continue to grow and that we will achieve certain levels of increased net income and earnings per share our results have at points in the past fallen short of results in prior periods our projections or the expectations of securities analysts or investors and they may do so in the future if we fail to increase our results over prior periods to achieve our projected results or to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline and the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance factors that could cause us not to do so include some factors that are within our control such as the execution of our offprice buying selection pricing and mix of merchandise inventory management including flow pricing markon and markdowns and management of our growth and some factors that are not within our control including actions of competitors weather conditions economic conditions consumer confidence seasonality and cost increases due among other things to government regulation and increased healthcare costs most of our operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not vary directly with the amount of our sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term as a result if sales in a particular quarter are below expectations for that quarter we may not be able to proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter resulting in a disproportionate effect on our net income for the quarter we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to project sales and align expenses if we do not correctly 

  

forecast sales and control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results our financial performance could be adversely affected in addition if we do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplate pursuant to our stock repurchase programs our earnings per share may be adversely affected 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions of new businesses or divest close or consolidate any of our current businesses our business will be subject to additional risks 

we have grown our business in part through mergers and acquisitions and may acquire new businesses or divest close or consolidate current businesses acquisition or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses  we may not effectively evaluate target companies or assess the risks benefits and cost of integration of acquisitions which can be difficult timeconsuming and dilutive acquisitions may not meet our performance and other expectations or may expose us to unexpected or greaterthanexpected liabilities and risks divestitures closings and consolidations also involve risks such as significant costs and obligations of closure including exposure on leases owned real estate and other contractual employment and severance obligations and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer failure to execute on mergers acquisitions divestitures closings and consolidations in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 

failure to comply with existing laws regulations and orders or changes in existing laws and regulations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

we are subject to federal state provincial and local laws rules and regulations in the united states and abroad any of which may change from time to time as well as orders and assurances these legal regulatory and administrative requirements collectively affect multiple aspects of our business from cost of health care workforce management logistics marketing importexport and others if we fail to comply with these laws rules regulations and orders we may be subject to fines or other penalties which could materially adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition further gaap may change from time to time and the changes could have material effects on our reported financial results and condition 

we must also comply with new and changing laws and regulations new legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms in the us and internationally could increase our costs of compliance or of doing business and could adversely affect our operating results including those involving 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation legal proceedings and other legal matters 

we are involved or may in the future become involved in various legal proceedings regulatory reviews and audits these may involve local state and federal government inquiries and investigations tax employment real estate tort consumer and intellectual property litigation or other disputes there have been a growing number of employmentrelated lawsuits including class actions in the united states and we are subject to these types of suits in addition we may be subject to investigations and other proceedings by regulatory agencies including consumer protection laws product safety laws advertising regulations escheat and employment and wage and hour regulations we cannot predict the results of legal and regulatory proceedings with certainty and actual results may differ from reserves we establish estimating the probable outcome regardless of merit litigation can be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expense and diversion of management attention legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations could expose us to 

  

significant defense costs fines penalties and liability to private parties and governmental entities for monetary recoveries and other amounts and attorneys’ fees andor require us to change aspects of our operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including the results of tax audits and examinations income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory income tax rates changes in income tax rates changes in transfer pricing changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in us tax legislation and regulation changes in foreign tax laws regulations and treaties exposure to additional tax liabilities changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods 

we are subject to the continuous examination of our tax returns and reports by federal state and local tax authorities in the us and foreign countries and the examining authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various proceedings with such authorities and in court with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these proceedings to determine the adequacy and appropriateness of our provision for income taxes and increase and decrease our provision as a result of these assessments however the actual results of proceedings as the result of rulings by or settlements with tax authorities and courts or due to changes in facts law or legal interpretations expiration of applicable statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions could differ from the amounts we have accrued for such proceedings in either a positive or a negative manner which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations 

in addition we are subject to tax audits and examinations for payroll value added sales based and other taxes relating to our businesses 

our real estate leases generally obligate us for long periods which subjects us to various financial risks 

we lease virtually all of our store locations generally for long terms and either own or lease for long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices accordingly we are subject to the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate which can have a material adverse effect on our results for example as has been reflected in our reserve for former operations while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions by making specified payments we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so if we decide to close stores we are generally required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases which generally includes among other things paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or paying to exercise rights to terminate and the performance of any of these obligations may be expensive when we assign or sublease leases we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform in addition when leases for the stores in our ongoing operations expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close stores 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our expansion operations interest and debt repayments stock repurchases and dividends 

our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash flow and to some extent upon the availability of financing sources to supply capital to fund our expansions general operating activities stock repurchases dividends interest and debt repayments our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities to access cash across our international operations or the lack of availability of financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed could adversely affect our financial performance including our earnings per share

the discussion that follows relates to our 52week fiscal years ended january 28 2012 fiscal 2012 january 29 2011 fiscal 2011 and january 30 2010 fiscal 2010 

overview 

the tjx companies inc is the largest offprice retailer of apparel and home fashions in the us and worldwide we sell a rapidly changing assortment of apparel home fashions and other merchandise through our four segments in the us marmaxx which operates tj maxx and marshalls and homegoods tjx canada which operates winners homesense and marshalls and tjx europe which operates tk maxx and homesense fiscal 2012 was another record year for us highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2012 include the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results followed by a discussion of our segment operating results 

net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal 2012 totaled 232 billion a 6 increase over 219 billion in fiscal 2011 the increase reflected a 5 increase from new stores a 4 increase from same store sales and a 1 increase from foreign currency exchange rates offset in part by a 4 decrease due to the elimination of sales from stores operating under the aj wright banner the fiscal 2012 sales from the converted aj wright stores are included in new stores consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011 totaled 219 billion an 8 increase over 203 billion in fiscal 2010 the increase reflected a 4 increase from same store sales a 3 increase from new stores and a 1 increase from foreign currency exchange rates 

our consolidated store count and selling square footage as of january 28 2012 each increased 2 as compared to the same period last year these levels of increase lower than our historical levels were primarily due to the 72 aj wright stores that were closed and not converted to other banners we expect to end fiscal 2013 with 3055 stores which would represent a 5 increase in both our consolidated store base and our selling square footage 

same store sales increases in the us for fiscal 2012 reflected an increase in both the value of the average transaction and the number of transactions which in turn reflected an increase in customer traffic same store sales of our home dresses men’s shoes and accessories categories were particularly strong geographically same store sales increases in the us were strong throughout most regions with florida and the southwest performing above the consolidated average and the midwest trailing the consolidated average although for the 

  

full fiscal year 2012 the same store sales increase for tjx europe was well below the consolidated average and same store sales at tjx canada decreased from the prior year both europe and canada posted strong same store sales gains in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 

the 4 same store sales increase in fiscal 2011 was driven entirely by growth in the number of transactions with the value of the average transaction down slightly for the year juniors jewelry and home performed particularly well in fiscal 2011 geographically in the us same store sales were strong throughout the country with the west coast and southwest above the consolidated average and the northeast below the consolidated average the same store sales increase in canada was in line with the consolidated average while same store sales decreased in europe 

we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial same store sales of our foreign segments are calculated on a constant currency basis meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of our foreign segments at the same exchange rates used in the prior year this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which we believe is a more accurate measure of segment operating performance 

the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales on an as reported and as adjusted basis 

 

   

  

 impact of foreign currency exchange rates our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies two ways in which foreign currency affects our reported results are as follows 

 

   

 cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 727 in fiscal 2012 731 in fiscal 2011 and 738 in fiscal 2010 the improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2012 was due to expense leverage on buying and occupancy costs particularly at marmaxx and homegoods partially offset by lower merchandise margins at tjx europe and tjx canada 

the improvement in this ratio for fiscal 2011 reflected improved consolidated merchandise margin which increased 05 percentage points over the prior year along with expense leverage on the 4 same store sales increase partially offset by a 02 percentage point negative impact from the aj wright segment loss in the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter arising from the aj wright consolidation merchandise margin improvement was driven by our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need leading to lower markdowns compared to the prior year 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 168 in fiscal 2012 169 in fiscal 2011 and 164 in fiscal 2010 the aj wright consolidation had a significant impact on this ratio in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 increasing the ratio by 03 percentage points in fiscal 2012 and 06 percentage points in fiscal 2011 excluding the impact of the aj wright consolidation selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 02 percentage points in fiscal 2012 and decreased 01 percentage points in fiscal 2011 the increase in the adjusted selling general and administrative expense ratio in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was due to increased general corporate expenses primarily investment in new systems talent and ecommerce costs associated with a voluntary retirement program and fourth quarter charges and writeoffs at tjx canada and tjx europe see segment discussions below offset in part by expense leverage on strong same store sales particularly at homegoods 

the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2011 as a percentage of net sales on an adjusted basis compared to fiscal 2010 reflected the benefit of cost reduction programs a reduction in incentive compensation versus the prior year and expense leverage on strong same store sales 

interest expense net interest expense net was an expense of 356 million for fiscal 2012 391 million for fiscal 2011 and 395 million for fiscal 2010 the components of interest expense net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

 

 gross interest expense for both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 was essentially flat to the respective prior periods 

income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was 380 in fiscal 2012 381 in fiscal 2011 and 378 in fiscal 2010 the decrease in the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is primarily attributable to a reduction in tax reserves related to the resolution of us federal tax audits partially offset by an increase in state and federal tax reserves for a net decrease in the provision 

  

the increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily attributable to the effects of repatriation of cash from europe and an increase in our state tax reserves partially offset by the finalization of an advance pricing agreement between canada and the united states related to our intercompany transfer pricing and a favorable canadian court ruling regarding withholding taxes 

we anticipate our effective annual income tax rate for fiscal 2013 will increase to 385 primarily due to the expiration of the us work opportunity tax credit legislation and the absence of the fiscal 2012 net benefit due to a reduction in our tax reserves 

income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations income from continuing operations was 15 billion in fiscal 2012 a 12 increase over 13 billion in fiscal 2011 which in turn was a 10 increase over 12 billion in fiscal 2010 

fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 193 our adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2012 were 199 which exclude the negative impact of 004 of costs related to closing the aj wright stores not closed in fiscal 2011 and 002 of costs to convert and reopen aj wright stores under other banners 

fiscal 2011 diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were 165 our adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 were 175 which exclude the negative effect of the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter segment loss for aj wright arising from closing aj wright which reduced earnings per share by 011 offset in part by a 001 per share benefit for a reduction in the provision for the computer intrusion related costs 

foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results when comparing fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2011 foreign currency exchange rates benefitted fiscal 2012 earnings per share by 001 per share compared with a 001 per share negative impact in fiscal 2011 when comparing fiscal 2011 to fiscal 2010 foreign currency exchange rates benefited fiscal 2011 earnings per share by 002 per share compared to an immaterial impact in fiscal 2010 

in addition our weighted average diluted shares outstanding affect the comparability of earnings per share our stock repurchases benefit our earnings per share we repurchased 497 million shares of our stock at a cost of 14 billion in fiscal 2012 551 million shares of our stock at a cost of 12 billion in fiscal 2011 and 540 million shares at a cost of 950 million in fiscal 2010 

discontinued operations and net income in fiscal 2011 we had a net gain from discontinued operations reflecting an aftertax benefit of 36 million which did not impact diluted earnings per share as a result of a 6 million pretax reduction of the estimated cost of settling leaserelated obligations of former businesses net income which includes the impact of these discontinued operations was 15 billion or 193 per share for fiscal 2012 13 billion or 165 per share for fiscal 2011 and 12 billion or 142 per share for fiscal 2010 

adjusted financial measures in addition to presenting financial results in conformity with gaap we are also presenting them on an “adjusted” basis we adjusted them to exclude 

 

  

 these adjusted financial results are nongaap financial measures we believe that the presentation of adjusted financial results provides additional information on comparisons between periods including underlying trends of our business by excluding these items that affect overall comparability we use these adjusted measures in making financial operating and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance and our board of directors use them in assessing our business and making compensation decisions nongaap financial measures should be considered in addition to and not as an alternative for our reported results prepared in accordance with gaap 

  

reconciliations of each of the adjusted financial measures to the financial measures in accordance with gaap are provided below 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the costs to convert aj wright stores to other banners and to hold grand reopenings affected our marmaxx and homegoods segments in fiscal 2012 a reconciliation of adjusted segment margin a nongaap financial measure to segment margin as reported in accordance with gaap for each of these segments is as follows 

 

      

segment information we operate four business segments in the united states our two segments are marmaxx tj maxx and marshalls stores and homegoods our tjx canada segment operates our stores in canada winners homesense and marshalls and our tjx europe segment operates our stores in europe tk maxx and homesense a j wright ceased to be a segment following its consolidation we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income or loss before general corporate expense and interest expense “segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities the terms “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” are used to describe segment profit or loss as a percentage of net sales 

presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments 

us segments 

marmaxx 

 

  net sales at marmaxx increased 9 in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 same store sales for marmaxx were up 5 on top of a 4 increase in the prior year 

same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2012 was driven by a balanced increase in the value of the average transaction and an increase in customer traffic customer transactions grew in fiscal 2012 on top of a significant increase in fiscal 2011 the categories that posted particularly strong same store sales increases in fiscal 2012 were dresses men’s shoes and accessories geographically there were strong same store sales increases throughout the country with florida and the southwest the strongest and the midwest below the chain average 

segment margin was up 02 percentage points to 135 for fiscal 2012 compared to 133 for fiscal 2011 primarily due to expense leverage particularly occupancy costs which improved by 03 percentage points on strong same store sales growth this improvement was offset in part by slightly lower merchandise margins and the store conversion and grand reopening costs of former aj wright stores converted to tj maxx or marshalls adjusted segment profit margin which excludes the aj wright conversion costs increased 03 percentage points to 136 for fiscal 2012 

segment margin increased to 133 in fiscal 2011 from 120 in fiscal 2010 this increase in segment margin for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margins of 08 percentage points largely as a result of lower markdowns in addition the 4 increase in same store sales for this period provided expense leverage as a percentage of net sales particularly occupancy costs which improved by 02 percentage points 

in fiscal 2013 we expect to open approximately 85 new marmaxx stores net of closings and increase selling square footage by 4 

  

homegoods 

 

  homegoods’ net sales increased 15 in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 same store sales increased 6 in fiscal 2012 on top of a strong same store sales increase of 6 in fiscal 2011 resulting from a strong increase in customer traffic along with an increase in the value of the average transaction segment profit margin for fiscal 2012 was 104 up from 95 for fiscal 2011 the increase was due to expense leverage on the 6 same store sales increase and an increase in merchandise margins primarily due to lower markdowns partially offset by the conversion and grand reopening costs of former aj wright stores converted to homegoods adjusted segment profit margin for fiscal 2012 excluding the aj wright conversion costs increased 11 percentage points to 106 

homegoods’ net sales increased 9 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 same store sales increased 6 in fiscal 2011 driven by continued strong growth in customer traffic compared to a same store sales increase of 9 in fiscal 2010 segment margin of 95 was up from 77 for fiscal 2010 due to increased merchandise margins driven by decreased markdowns levering of expenses on the 6 same store sales and operational efficiencies the merchandise margin improvements were driven by efforts to manage this business with much lower inventory levels than in previous years and by increasing our inventory turns 

in fiscal 2013 we plan a net increase of approximately 40 homegoods stores and plan to increase selling square footage by 11 

aj wright 

we completed the consolidation of the aj wright division in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 closing the remaining stores not being converted to other banners these closing costs primarily leaserelated obligations and aj wright operating losses incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 were reported as an aj wright segment loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 

due to the anticipated migration of customers to other chains aj wright was not treated as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes 

 

   

a majority of the costs related to the closing of the aj wright business were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 the operating results of the aj wright segment for the full year of fiscal 2011 include a fourth quarter loss of 1406 million which includes the following 

 

 international segments 

tjx canada 

 

 net sales for tjx canada increased 7 in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 currency translation benefitted fiscal 2012 sales growth by approximately 4 percentage points as compared to the same period last year same store sales decreased 1 in fiscal 2012 compared to an increase of 4 in fiscal 2011 largely due to execution issues in women’s and to a lesser extent children’s categories our efforts to address these issues showed improved results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 with same store sales growth of 3 

segment profit for fiscal 2012 decreased to 3480 million due to weak sales volume in the first three quarters mitigated in part by strong inventory and expense management and to a lesser extent a fourth quarter charge of 6 million for the closure of our stylesense stores these decreases in segment profit more than offset a 10 million benefit from foreign currency translation and a 4 million benefit from marktomarket adjustment on inventoryrelated hedges the decrease in segment margin for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was due to expense deleverage and lower merchandise margins which more than offset the favorable change in the marktomarket adjustment of our inventoryrelated hedges 

net sales for tjx canada increased 16 in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 currency translation benefitted fiscal 2011 sales growth by approximately 9 percentage points as compared to the same period in the prior year same store sales were up 4 in fiscal 2011 compared to an increase of 2 in fiscal 2010 same store sales of men’s apparel dresses and home fashions were above the segment average for fiscal 2011 

segment profit for fiscal 2011 increased to 352 million compared to 255 million in fiscal 2010 the impact of foreign currency translation increased segment profit by 25 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the marktomarket adjustment on inventoryrelated hedges reduced segment profit in fiscal 2011 by 7 million compared to an immaterial impact in fiscal 2010 segment margin increased 22 percentage points to 140 in 

  

fiscal 2011 compared to 118 in fiscal 2010 the segment margin improvement in fiscal 2011 was driven by a strong improvement in merchandise margins offset by the unfavorable change in the marktomarket adjustment of our inventory hedges which reduced fiscal 2011 segment margin by 03 percentage points 

we opened our first six marshalls stores in canada in fiscal 2012 we expect to add a net of 15 stores in canada in fiscal 2013 and plan to increase selling square footage by 5 

tjx europe 

 

 net sales for tjx europe increased 16 in fiscal 2012 to 29 billion compared to 25 billion in fiscal 2011 currency translation benefited fiscal 2012 sales growth by 4 percentage points same store sales were up 2 in fiscal 2012 compared to a decrease of 3 in fiscal 2011 tjx europe ended fiscal 2012 by posting a fourth quarter same store sales increase of 10 we believe the improvement at the end of fiscal 2012 reflected the benefits of our strategy of slowing growth in europe and refocusing on execution of our offprice fundamentals 

segment profit decreased to 687 million for fiscal 2012 and segment profit margin decreased to 24 for fiscal 2012 the impact of foreign currency translation and the marktomarket adjustment on inventoryrelated hedges was immaterial our fiscal 2012 results reflect aggressive markdowns primarily taken in the first quarter to clear inventory and adjust our merchandise mix in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 tjx europe incurred charges for the closing of an office facility and the writeoff of certain technology systems and other adjustments which contributed to the decrease in segment profit and segment margin despite these fourth quarter charges segment profit for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 nearly doubled reflecting the effects of the changes we made to address the execution issues that adversely affected fiscal 2011 and earlier parts of fiscal 2012 

net sales for tjx europe increased in fiscal 2011 to 25 billion compared to 23 billion in fiscal 2010 currency translation negatively impacted the fiscal 2011 results reducing net sales by 86 million same store sales were down 3 in fiscal 2011 compared to a 5 increase in fiscal 2010 segment profit decreased to 758 million for fiscal 2011 and segment profit margin decreased to 30 issues with the execution of our offprice fundamentals as well as growth which we believe was too aggressive led to tjx europe’s belowplan sales and segment profit in fiscal 2011 

in fiscal 2013 we plan to keep our growth rate modest with a net of 10 new tk maxx stores in europe expanding selling square footage by 2 longer term we continue to believe that tjx europe holds significant growth potential for our company 

  

general corporate expense 

 

 general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling general and administrative expenses the increase in general corporate expense for fiscal 2012 was primarily due to our investments in systems and technology talent and associate training expenses costs related to our ecommerce initiative and costs related to a fourth quarter voluntary retirement program and an executive separation agreement collectively these items accounted for approximately 40 million of the increase in general corporate expenses for fiscal 2012 fiscal 2011 general corporate expense was relatively flat to the prior year 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1916 million in fiscal 2012 1976 million in fiscal 2011 and 2272 million in fiscal 2010 the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2012 decreased 60 million compared to fiscal 2011 net income plus the noncash impact of depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of 1995 million in fiscal 2012 compared to 1897 in fiscal 2011 an increase of 98 million the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of 224 million in fiscal 2012 compared to 48 million in fiscal 2011 the increase in inventory was in our distribution centers primarily due to higher packaway inventory as we continued to take advantage of market opportunities the average inventory in our stores at the end of fiscal 2012 was below fiscal 2011 levels the additional cash outlay for the net change in inventory and accounts payable is due to the timing of payments the impact of the changes in all other assets and liabilities which reduced operating cash flows by 77 million yearoveryear was more than offset by the favorable impact on cash flows of 94 million due to a higher deferred income tax provision 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2011 decreased 295 million compared to fiscal 2010 net income plus the noncash impact of depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of 1897 million in fiscal 2011 compared to 1659 in fiscal 2010 an increase of 238 million the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of 48 million in fiscal 2011 compared to a source of cash of 345 million in fiscal 2010 although we continued to operate with leaner inventories throughout fiscal 2011 our strategy of being more aggressive with managing inventories had a much greater impact on cash flows in fiscal 2010 in addition the increase in inventory in fiscal 2011 reflected our business growth as well as a yearend increase in packaway merchandise to take advantage of market opportunities changes in current income taxes payablerecoverable unfavorably impacted fiscal 2011 cash flows as compared to fiscal 2010 by 203 million due to the timing of tax payments the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities provided cash of 78 million in fiscal 2011 compared to cash provided of 31 million in fiscal 2010 

we have a reserve for the remaining future obligations of operations we have closed sold or otherwise disposed of including among others bob’s stores and aj wright the majority of these obligations relate to real estate leases associated with these operations the reserve balance was 454 million at january 28 2012 and 547 million at january 29 2011 the cash flows required to satisfy obligations of former operations are classified as a reduction in cash provided by operating activities see note c to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

investing activities 

our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below 

 

   

we expect that we will spend approximately 875 million to 900 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 including approximately 415 million for our offices and distribution centers including information systems to support growth 305 million for store renovations and 180 million for new stores we plan to fund these expenditures through internally generated funds 

we also purchased shortterm investments that had initial maturities in excess of 90 days which per our policy are not classified as cash on the balance sheets presented in fiscal 2012 we purchased 152 million of such shortterm investments compared to 120 million in fiscal 2011 additionally 133 million of such shortterm investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2012 compared to 180 million last year 

financing activities 

cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 1336 million in fiscal 2012 1224 million in fiscal 2011 and 584 million in fiscal 2010 

under our stock repurchase programs we spent 1370 million to repurchase 497 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2012 1201 million to repurchase 551 million shares in fiscal 2011 and 950 million to repurchase 540 million shares in fiscal 2010 all of which were retired we record the purchase of our stock on a settlement basis and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our repurchases all share information disclosed is on a postsplit basis as of january 28 2012 225 million was available for purchase under the stock repurchase program approved in february 2011 on january 31 2012 our board of directors approved an additional repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional 2 billion of tjx stock we currently plan to repurchase approximately 12 billion to 13 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2013 we determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow liquidity economic and market conditions our assessment of prospects for our business legal requirements and other factors the timing and amount of these purchases may change 

cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2010 include the net proceeds of 774 million from two debt offerings in april 2009 we issued 375 million aggregate principal amount of 695 tenyear notes in connection with this issuance we called for the redemption of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes virtually all of which were converted into 302 million shares of common stock we used the proceeds of the 695 notes to repurchase additional shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program in july 2009 we issued 400 million aggregate principal amount of 420 sixyear notes we used a portion of the proceeds of this offering to refinance our c235 million term credit facility in august 2009 prior to its scheduled maturity and used the remainder together with funds from operations to pay our 745 notes on their scheduled maturity date in december 2009 

we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 038 per share in fiscal 2012 030 per share in fiscal 2011 and 024 per share in fiscal 2010 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 275 million in fiscal 2012 229 million in fiscal 2011 and 198 million in fiscal 2010 we announced our intention to increase the quarterly dividend on our common stock to 0115 per share effective with the dividend to be declared in april 2012 and payable in may 2012 subject to the approval and declaration of our board of directors we also received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 219 million in fiscal 2012 176 million in fiscal 2011 and 170 million in fiscal 2010 

we traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements primarily through cash generated from operations shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of shortterm commercial paper we also have 1 billion in revolving credit facilities which are described in note k to the consolidated financial statements we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents internally generated funds and our revolving credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs over the next fiscal year 

  

contractual obligations as of january 28 2012 we had payment obligations including current installments under longterm debt arrangements leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations requiring cash outflows as follows in thousands 

 

 the longterm debt obligations above include estimated interest costs the operating lease commitments above are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance real estate taxes other operating expenses and in some cases rentals based on a percentage of sales these items totaled approximately onethird of the total minimum rent for fiscal 2012 purchase obligations include obligations under purchase orders for merchandise capital items supplies and other operating items contracts for maintenance needs and other services and executive employment and other agreements our purchase obligations do not include agreements that can be cancelled without penalty 

we also have longterm liabilities which include 3022 million for employee compensation and benefits the majority of which will come due beyond five years 1636 million for accrued rent the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table and 2496 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid 

critical accounting policies 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to the areas described below 

inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory which results in a weighted average cost under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory this method is widely used in the retail industry and we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other inventory accounting methods it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced typically a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns however as a normal business practice we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end thus actual and estimated amounts of shrinkage may differ in quarterly results but the difference is typically not a significant factor in full year results overall we believe that the retail method coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and the full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated lastly many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions that ultimately affect the value of inventory we have generally not entered into such arrangements with our vendors in our continuing operations 

impairment of longlived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of 

  

individual stores as well as of our business units which involve a number of factors including historical trends recent performance and general economic assumptions if we determine that an impairment of longlived assets has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets we believe as of january 28 2012 that the carrying value of our longlived assets was appropriate 

retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates we are required to make assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the longterm rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period the discount rate which we determine annually based on market interest rates and our estimated longterm rate of return which can differ considerably from actual returns are two factors that can have a significant impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan when the market performance of our plan assets discount rates or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan we may make contributions to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements in fiscal 2012 we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of 75 million 

sharebased compensation in accordance with gaap we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan the fair value of the awards is amortized as “sharebased compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service we use the blackscholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates such as participant activity and market results the use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost 

reserves for uncertain tax positions like many large corporations our income and other tax returns and reports are regularly audited by federal state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and such authorities may challenge positions we take we are engaged in various administrative and judicial proceedings in multiple jurisdictions with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds and other tax matters which proceedings are in various stages of negotiation assessment examination litigation and settlement the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain in accordance with gaap we evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the positions we have taken will not be sustained however in the next twelve months and in future periods the amounts we accrue for uncertain tax positions from time to time or ultimately pay as the result of the final resolutions of examinations judicial or administrative proceedings changes in facts law or legal interpretations expirations of applicable statute of limitations or other resolutions of or changes in tax positions may differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued and may result in a reduction to or additional accruals refund claims or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made final resolutions of our tax positions or changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions could result in additional tax expense or benefit and could have a material impact on our results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

reserves for former operations as discussed in note c to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the management’s discussion and analysis we have reserves for probable losses arising for future obligations of former operations primarily real estate leases we must make estimates and assumptions about the costs and expenses we will incur in connection with the future obligations of our former operations the leases relating to aj wright and other former operations are longterm obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including when and on what terms we will assign the lease or sublease the leased properties whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors including indemnification may exist 

  

to any liability we may have we develop these assumptions based on past experience and evaluation of various potential outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location we believe that our reserves are reasonable estimates of the most likely outcomes of the future obligations arising out of the future obligations of our former operations and should be adequate to cover the ultimate costs we will incur however actual results may differ from our current estimates and we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for future developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors although we do not expect any such differences to be material to our results of operations 

loss contingencies  certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our management with the assistance of our legal counsel assesses such contingent liabilities such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

tjx is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business some potential market risks are discussed below 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on the translation of our foreign operations into the us dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold and on intercompany debt and interest payable between our domestic and international operations as more fully described in note f to our consolidated financial statements we use derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of certain merchandise purchase commitments primarily at our international operations and intercompany transactions with our international operations we enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging the underlying economic exposure we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses on the underlying exposures the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency as of january 28 2012 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pretax income for fiscal 2012 by approximately 42 million 

interest rate risk 

our cash equivalents shortterm investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by us in addition changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest expense we periodically use 

  

financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing however we believe that fixed interest rates on most of our debt minimizes our exposure to changes in market conditions we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates applied to our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of january 28 2012 there were no variable rate borrowings outstanding as of january 28 2012 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement as of that date would not have had a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

equity price risk 

the assets of our qualified pension plan a large portion of which are equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets we invest the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties investments in general are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility risks a significant decline in the financial markets could adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan resulting in increased contributions to the plan 

we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes

business overview 

 

the tjx companies inc tjx is the leading offprice apparel and home fashions retailer in the united states and worldwide our over 2700 stores offer a rapidly changing assortment of quality brandname and designer merchandise at prices generally 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices every day 

 

retail concepts we operate multiple offprice retail chains in the us canada and europe which are known for their treasure hunt shopping experience and excellent values on fashionable brandname merchandise our stores turn their inventories rapidly relative to traditional retailers to create a sense of urgency and excitement for our customers which encourages frequent customer visits with our flexible “no walls” business model we can quickly expand and contract merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes although our stores primarily target the middle to upper middle income customer we reach a broad range of customers across many demographic groups and income levels with the values we offer the operating platforms and strategies of all of our retail concepts are synergistic as a result we capitalize on our expertise and systems throughout our business leveraging information best practices initiatives and new ideas and developing talent across our concepts we also leverage the substantial buying power of our businesses in our global relationships with vendors

aj wright consolidation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 we announced our decision to consolidate aj wright an offprice retailer of family apparel and home fashions primarily targeting the lower middle income customer by converting 90 of its stores to tj maxx marshalls or homegoods banners and by closing the remaining 72 stores two distribution centers and home office we have increasingly improved our ability to reach the aj wright customer demographic through our tj maxx and marshalls stores and have seen these stores perform well in markets with these demographics consolidating the aj wright chain is expected to allow us to serve this customer demographic more efficiently focus our financial and managerial resources on fewer larger businesses with higher returns and enhance the growth prospects for the company overall for more detail on the aj wright consolidation see note c to the consolidated financial statements 

 

flexible business model our offprice business model is flexible particularly for a company of our size allowing us to react to market trends our opportunistic buying and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than traditional retailers and the design and operation of our stores and distribution centers support this flexibility by maintaining a liquid inventory position our merchants can buy close to need enabling them to buy into current market trends and take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace buying close to need gives us insight into consumer and fashion trends and current pricing at the time we make our purchases helping us “buy smarter” and reduce our markdown exposure our selling floor space is flexible without walls between departments and largely free of permanent fixtures so we can easily expand and contract departments in response to customer demand as well as market and fashion trends our distribution facilities are designed to accommodate our methods of receiving and shipping broadly ranging quantities of product to our large store base quickly and efficiently 

 

opportunistic buying we are differentiated from traditional retailers by our opportunistic buying of quality fashionable brand name merchandise which permits us to buy into current trends and pricing we purchase the majority of our apparel inventory and a significant portion of our home fashion inventory opportunistically virtually all of our opportunistic purchases are made at discounts from initial wholesale prices our merchant organization numbers over 700 and we operate 12 buying offices in nine countries in contrast to traditional retailers which typically order goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor our merchants are in the marketplace virtually every week they buy primarily for the current selling season and to a limited extent for a future selling season buying later in the inventory cycle than traditional retailers and using the flexibility of our stores to shift in and out of categories we are able to take advantage of opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from the routine flow of inventory in the highly fragmented apparel and home fashions marketplace such as order cancellations manufacturer overruns and special production we operate with lean inventory levels compared to conventional retailers to give ourselves the flexibility to take advantage of these opportunities 

 

we buy most of our inventory directly from manufacturers with some coming from retailers and other sources a small percentage of the merchandise we sell is private label merchandise produced for us by third parties our expansive vendor universe which is in excess of 14000 provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise we have not historically experienced difficulty in obtaining adequate amounts of quality inventory for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments and believe that we will continue to have adequate inventory as we continue to grow 

 

we believe a number of factors make us an attractive outlet for the vendor community and provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise we are typically willing to purchase lessthanfull assortments of items styles and sizes and quantities ranging from small to very large we are able to disperse inventory across our geographically diverse network of stores we pay promptly and we generally do not ask for typical retail concessions such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries or return privileges importantly we provide vendors an outlet with financial strength and an excellent credit rating 

 

inventory management we offer our customers a rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a “treasure hunt” experience in our stores and spur customer visits to achieve this we seek to turn the inventory in our stores rapidly regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions at excellent values our specialized inventory planning purchasing monitoring and markdown systems coupled with distribution center storage processing handling and shipping systems enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local preferences and demographics achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of products and sell substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods we make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations centrally using 

 

  information provided by specialized computer systems designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner we do not generally engage in promotional pricing activity such as sales or coupons over the past several years we have improved our supply chain allowing us to reduce inventory levels and ship more efficiently and quickly we plan to continue to invest in our supply chain with the goal of more precisely and effectively allocating the right merchandise to each store and delivering it quicker and more efficiently 

 

pricing our mission is to offer retail prices in our stores generally 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular retail prices through our opportunistic purchasing we are generally able to react to price fluctuations in the wholesale market to maintain this pricing for example in a time of rising inventory prices if conventional retailers increase retail prices to preserve merchandise margin we typically are able to increase our retail prices correspondingly while maintaining our value relative to conventional retailers and preserve our own merchandise margin if conventional retailers do not raise prices to pass rising inventory costs on to consumers we seek to buy inventory at prices that permit us to maintain our values relative to conventional retailers and sustain our merchandise margins 

 

low cost operations we operate with a low cost structure compared to many traditional retailers we focus aggressively on expenses throughout our business although we have enhanced our advertising over the past several years to attract new customers to our stores our advertising budget as a percentage of sales remains low compared to traditional retailers we design our stores generally located in community shopping centers to provide a pleasant convenient shopping environment but relative to other retailers do not spend heavily on store fixtures additionally our distribution network is designed to run cost effectively we continue to pursue cost savings in our operations 

 

customer service while we offer a selfservice format we train our store associates to provide friendly and helpful customer service and seek to staff our stores to deliver a positive shopping experience we typically offer customerfriendly return policies we accept a variety of payment methods including cash credit cards and debit cards in the us we offer a cobranded tjx credit card and a private label credit card both through a bank but do not own the customer receivables related to either program we are engaged in a store upgrade program across our banners designed to enhance the customer shopping experience and drive sales 

 

distribution we operate distribution centers encompassing approximately 10 million square feet in four countries which are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model we ship substantially all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers as well as warehouses and shipping centers operated by third parties we shipped approximately 18 billion units to our stores during fiscal 2011

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks that follow individually or in the aggregate are those that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements 

 

global economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

 

during the recent economic recession global financial markets experienced extreme volatility disruption and credit contraction the volatility and disruption to the capital markets significantly adversely affected global economic conditions resulting in additional significant recessionary pressures and declines in employment levels disposable income and actual and perceived wealth although there have been some recent improvements continuing or worsened adverse economic conditions including higher unemployment energy and health care costs interest rates and taxes and tighter credit could continue to affect consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending adversely and may adversely affect our sales cash flows and results of operations additionally renewed financial turmoil in the financial and credit markets could adversely affect our costs of capital and the sources of liquidity available to us and could increase our pension funding requirements 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

 

in addition to our us businesses we operate stores in canada and europe and plan to continue to expand our international operations sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and changes in foreign exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into us dollars for financial reporting purposes because of this movements in exchange rates have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our net sales and earnings 

 

additionally we routinely enter into inventoryrelated hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins of merchandise purchased by our international segments that is denominated in currencies other than their local currencies in accordance with us gaap we evaluate the fair value of these hedging instruments and make marktomarket adjustments at the end of an accounting period these adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our earnings 

 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates can also increase the cost of inventory purchases by our businesses that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the business when these changes occur suddenly it can be difficult for us to adjust retail prices accordingly and gross margin can be adversely affected a significant amount of merchandise we offer for sale is made in china and accordingly a revaluation of the chinese currency or increased market flexibility in the exchange rate for that currency increasing its value relative to the us dollar or currencies in which our stores are located could be particularly significant 

 

although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates we expect that foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations in addition fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may have a greater impact on our earnings and operating results if a counterparty to one of our hedging arrangements fails to perform 

 

failure to execute our opportunistic buying and inventory management could adversely affect our business 

 

we purchase the majority of our apparel inventory and much of our home inventory opportunistically with our buyers purchasing close to need to drive traffic to the stores and to increase same store sales the treasure hunt nature of the offprice buying experience is enhanced by rapid inventory turns and continued replenishment of fresh high quality attractively priced merchandise in our stores while opportunistic buying provides our buyers the ability to buy at desirable times and prices in the quantities we need and into market trends it places considerable discretion in our buyers subjecting us to risks on the appropriate pricing quantity nature and timing of inventory flowing to our stores in addition we base our purchases of inventory in part on sales forecasts if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand we may experience higher inventory levels and need to take markdowns on excess or slowmoving inventory leading to decreased profit margins or we 

 

  may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand leading to lost sales either of which could adversely affect our financial performance our pricing model requires that we purchase inventory sufficiently below conventional retail to maintain our pricing differential and margin which we may not achieve at times we must also properly execute our inventory management strategies through appropriately allocating merchandise among our stores timely and efficiently distributing inventory to stores maintaining an appropriate mix and level of inventory in stores appropriately changing the allocation of floor space of stores among product categories to respond to customer demand and effectively managing pricing and markdowns our vendors and others in our supply chain are also subject to risks of labor issues financial liquidity weather and other natural disasters economic political and regulatory conditions and other matters that could affect our ability to receive and provide to our stores acceptable merchandise in adequate quantities on a timely basis failure to execute our opportunistic inventory buying and inventory management well could adversely affect our performance and our relationship with our customers 

 

failure to continue to expand our operations successfully could adversely affect our financial results 

 

our revenue growth is dependent among other things upon our ability to continue to expand successfully through successful new store openings as well as our ability to increase same store sales successful store growth requires acquisition and development of appropriate real estate including selection of store locations in appropriate geographies availability of attractive stores or store sites in such locations and negotiation of acceptable terms competition for desirable sites increases in real estate construction and development costs and availability and costs of capital could limit our ability to open new stores in desirable locations in the future or adversely affect the economics of new stores we may encounter difficulties in attracting customers in new markets for various reasons including decisions to open new banners expansion into new geographies customers’ lack of familiarity with our brands or our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and cultural differences new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores and new and existing stores in a market area may adversely affect each other’s sales and profitability further expansion places significant demands on the administrative merchandising store operations distribution and other organizations in our businesses to manage rapid growth and we may not do so successfully as a result we may need to reduce our rate of expansion or we may operate with decreased operational efficiency and it may adversely affect our results 

 

failure to successfully identify customer trends and preferences to meet customer demand could negatively impact our performance 

 

because our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand we take various steps to keep up with customer trends and preferences including contacts with vendors monitoring product category and fashion trends and comparison shopping our flexible business model allows us to buy close to need and in response to consumer preferences and trends and to expand and contract merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes however identifying consumer trends and preferences in the various geographies in which we do business and successfully meeting customer demand is challenging and we may not successfully do so which could adversely affect our results 

 

our quarterly operating results can be subject to significant fluctuations and may fall short of either a prior quarter or investors’ expectations 

 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past and they may continue to do so in the future our earnings may not continue to grow at rates we plan and may fall short of either a prior quarter or investors’ expectations if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline factors that could cause us not to meet our securities analysts’ or investors’ earnings expectations include some factors that are within our control such as the execution of our offprice buying selection pricing and mix of merchandise and inventory management including flow markon and markdowns and some factors that are not within our control including actions of competitors weather conditions economic conditions consumer confidence seasonality and cost increases due among other things to government regulation and increased healthcare costs in addition if we do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplate pursuant to our stock repurchase program our earnings per share may be adversely affected most of our operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not vary directly with the amount of sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term as a result if sales in a particular quarter are below expectations for that quarter we may not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter and therefore such a sales shortfall would have a disproportionate effect on our net income for the quarter we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to project sales and align expenses if we do not correctly forecast sales and control costs or appropriately adjust costs to actual results our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 

 

  our future performance is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand within our existing markets and to extend our offprice model in new product lines chains and geographic regions 

 

our strategy is to continue to expand within existing markets to expand to new markets and geographies and to attract new customers in existing and new markets across demographics this growth strategy includes developing new ways to sell more or different categories of merchandise within our existing stores continued expansion of our existing chains in our existing markets and countries expansion of these chains to new markets and countries development and opening of new chains or potential expansion of ecommerce all of which entail significant risk our growth is dependent upon our ability to successfully extend our business in these ways if any of our expansion vehicles does not achieve the success we expect in whole or in part we may be required to increase our investment or close stores or operations unsuccessful extension of our model could adversely affect growth and financial performance 

 

if we fail to successfully implement our marketing advertising and promotional programs or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are our revenue may be adversely affected 

 

we use marketing advertising and promotional programs to attract customers to our stores we use various media for these programs including print television social media database marketing and direct marketing some of our competitors may have substantially larger expenditures for their programs which may provide them with a competitive advantage there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to execute our marketing advertising and promotional programs effectively and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations information posted about us and our merchandise on social media platforms and similar venues including blogs social media websites and other forums for internetbased communications that allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons may be inaccurate or may harm our brand which could have a material effect on our revenue and results of operations 

 

compromises of our data security could materially harm our reputation and business 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store certain personal information from individuals such as our customers and associates and we process customer payment card and check information we suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions such intrusion or intrusions collectively the “computer intrusion” into portions of our computer system that process and store information related to customer transactions discovered late in fiscal 2007 in which we believe customer data were stolen we have taken steps designed to further strengthen the security of our computer system and protocols and have instituted an ongoing program with respect to data security consistent with a consent order with the federal trade commission nevertheless there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a future data compromise we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential information further the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk are determined and controlled by the payment card industry not by us this is also true for check information and approval computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer system and if successful misappropriate personal information payment card or check information or confidential company business information in addition a company associate contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology new tools and other developments may increase the risk of such a breach any such compromise of our data security and loss of personal or business information could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and customers’ willingness to shop in our stores violate applicable laws regulations orders and agreements and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material 

 

our business is subject to seasonal influences a decrease in sales or margins during the second half of the year could disproportionately adversely affect our operating results 

 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we generally realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the year which includes the backtoschool and yearend holiday seasons any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we may experience risks associated with our substantial size and scale 

 

we operate multiple retail chains in the us canada and europe some aspects of the businesses and operations of the chains are conducted with relative autonomy the large size of our operations our multiple businesses and the autonomy 

 

  afforded to the chains increase the risk that systems and practices will not be implemented uniformly throughout our company and that information will not be appropriately shared across different chains and countries 

 

unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate or our distribution centers are located could adversely affect our operating results 

 

adverse and unseasonable weather affects customers’ willingness to shop and their demand for the merchandise in our stores severe weather could also affect our ability to transport merchandise to our stores from our distribution and shipping centers as a result frequent unusually heavy unseasonable or untimely weather in our markets such as snow ice or rain storms severe cold or heat or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures could adversely affect our sales and increase markdowns increased governmental regulations focused on climate change could increase compliance costs 

 

our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic events 

 

unforeseen public health issues such as pandemics and epidemics as well as natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other adverse weather and climate conditions whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt our operations or the operations of one or more of our vendors or could severely damage or destroy one or more of our stores or distribution facilities located in the affected areas day to day operations particularly our ability to receive products from our vendors or transport products to our stores could be adversely affected or we could be required to close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by the affected distribution center as a result our business could be adversely affected 

 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

 

the retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive we compete with many other local regional national and international retailers that sell apparel home fashions and other merchandise we sell whether in stores through catalogues or media or over the internet we compete on the basis of fashion quality price value merchandise selection and freshness brand name recognition service reputation and store location other competitive factors that influence the demand for our merchandise include our advertising marketing and promotional activities and the name recognition and reputation of our chains if we fail to compete effectively our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

failure to attract and retain quality sales distribution center and other associates in appropriate numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel could adversely affect our performance 

 

our performance depends on recruiting developing training and retaining quality sales distribution center and other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel many of our associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover the nature of the workforce in the retail industry subjects us to the risk of immigration law violations which risk has increased in recent years in addition any failure of thirdparties that perform services on our behalf to comply with immigration employment or other laws could damage our reputation or disrupt our ability to obtain needed labor our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates minimum wage legislation changing demographics health and other insurance costs and governmental labor and employment requirements recently enacted health care reform legislation could increase our costs in the event of increasing wage rates if we fail to increase our wages competitively the quality of our workforce could decline causing our customer service to suffer while increasing our wages could cause our earnings to decrease in addition certain associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must do significant internal training and development for a substantial number of our associates the market for retail management is highly competitive and in common with other retailers we face challenges in securing sufficient management talent if we do not continue to attract train and retain quality associates and management personnel our performance could be adversely affected 

 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions of new businesses or divest close or consolidate any of our current businesses our business will be subject to additional risks 

 

we have grown our business in part through mergers and acquisitions and may acquire new businesses or divest close or consolidate current businesses acquisition or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses we may do a lessthanoptimal job of evaluating target companies and their risks and benefits and integration of acquisitions can be difficult and timeconsuming acquisitions may not meet our performance and other expectations or may expose us to unexpected or greaterthanexpected liabilities and risks divestitures closings and 

 

  consolidations also involve risks such as the risks of exposure on lease and other contractual employment and severance obligations obligations undertaken in the process and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of the acquirer failure to execute on mergers or divestitures closings and consolidations in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 

 

failure to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

 

we rely extensively on various information systems data centers and software applications to manage many aspects of our business including to process and record transactions in our stores to enable effective communication systems to plan and track inventory flow and to generate performance and financial reports we are dependent on the integrity security and consistent operations of these systems and related backup systems our computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by our associates or contractors the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends upon these information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement appropriate new technologies systems controls data centers and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm our profitability 

 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our expansion operations interest and debt repayments stock repurchases and dividends 

 

our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash flow and to some extent upon the availability of financing sources to supply capital to fund our expansions general operating activities stock repurchases dividends interest and debt repayments our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of availability of financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed could adversely affect our financial performance including our earnings per share 

 

general economic and other factors may adversely affect consumer spending which could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

 

interest rates recession inflation deflation consumer credit availability consumer debt levels energy costs tax rates and policy unemployment trends threats or possibilities of war terrorism or other global or national unrest actual or threatened epidemics political or financial instability and general economic political and other factors beyond our control have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending consumer spending in turn affects sales at retailers which may include tjx although we benefit from being an offprice retailer these factors could adversely affect our sales and performance if we are not able to implement strategies to mitigate them promptly and successfully 

 

issues with merchandise quality or safety could damage our reputation sales and financial results 

 

various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we sell in our stores regulations and standards in this area including those related to the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 in the united states and similar legislation in other countries in which we operate change from time to time our inability to comply on a timely basis with regulatory requirements could result in significant fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results we rely on our vendors to provide quality merchandise that complies with applicable product safety laws and other applicable laws but they may not comply with their contractual obligations to do so issues with the quality and safety of merchandise particularly with food bath and body and children’s products or issues with the genuineness of merchandise regardless of our fault or customer concerns about such issues could cause damage to our reputation and could result in lost sales uninsured product liability claims or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs and regulatory civil or criminal fines or penalties any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

we are subject to import risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries 

 

many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a lesser extent by us in many foreign countries particularly southeastern asia where we are the importer of record we may be subject to regulatory or other requirements similar to those imposed upon the manufacturer of such products we are subject to the various risks of 

 

  doing business in foreign markets importing merchandise from abroad and purchasing product made in foreign countries such as 

 

  

political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates labor conditions transport capacity and costs systems issues problems in third party distribution and warehousing and other interruptions of the supply chain compliance with us and foreign laws and regulations and other factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise beyond our control could affect the availability and the price of our inventory furthermore although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad there can be no assurance that our associates contractors agents vendors or other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies which could subject us to liability and could adversely affect our operations or operating results 

 

our expanding international operations increasingly expose us to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions 

 

we have a significant retail presence in canada and europe as well as buying offices around the world and our goal as a global retailer is to continue to expand into other international markets in the future our foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by our us operations as well as risks inherent in foreign operations such as understanding the retail climate and trends local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets complying with foreign laws rules and regulations and foreign currency fluctuations which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

 

our results may be adversely affected by increases in the price of oil and other commodities 

 

prices of oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past and have recently risen significantly increase in the price of oil increases our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers although we have implemented a hedging strategy to manage a portion of our transportation costs increases in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs which could have an adverse effect on our performance similarly other commodity prices have also fluctuated dramatically in the past cost of cotton and synthetic fabrics have recently risen significantly such increases are expected to increase the cost of merchandise which could adversely affect our performance through potentially reduced consumer demand or reduced margins 

 

failure to comply with existing laws regulations and orders or changes in existing laws and regulations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

 

we are subject to federal state provincial and local laws rules and regulations in the united states and abroad any of which may change from time to time as well as orders and assurances if we fail to comply with these laws rules regulations and orders we may be subject to fines or other penalties which could materially adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition we must also comply with new and changing laws further generally 

 

  accepted accounting principles gaap in the us may change from time to time and the changes could have material effects on our reported financial results and condition in addition there have been a large number of new legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms introduced in the us and the initiatives and reforms that have been and may be enacted may increase our costs 

 

our results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation and other legal proceedings 

 

we are periodically involved in various legal proceedings which may involve local state and federal government inquiries and investigations tax employment real estate tort consumer litigation and intellectual property litigation or other disputes there have been a growing number of employmentrelated lawsuits including class actions and we have been subject to these types of suits in addition we may be subject to investigations and other proceedings by regulatory agencies including but not limited to consumer protection laws advertising regulations escheat and employment and wage and hour regulations results of legal and regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and may differ from reserves we establish estimating the probable outcome regardless of merit litigation may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations could expose us to significant defense costs fines penalties and liability to private parties and governmental entities for monetary recoveries and other amounts and attorneys’ fees andor require us to change aspects of our operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

our real estate leases generally obligate us for long periods which subjects us to various financial risks 

 

we lease virtually all of our store locations generally for long terms and either own or lease for long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices accordingly we are subject to the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate which can have a material adverse effect on our results as reflected in our reserve for former operations while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions by making specified payments we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so if we decide to close stores we are generally required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases which generally includes among other things paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or paying to exercise rights to terminate and the performance of any of these obligations may be expensive when we assign or sublease leases we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform in addition when leases for the stores in our ongoing operations expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close stores 

 

our stock price may fluctuate based on market expectations 

 

the public trading of our stock is based in large part on market expectations that our business will continue to grow and that we will achieve certain levels of net income if the securities analysts that regularly follow our stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance the market price of our stock is likely to drop in addition if our quarterly financial performance does not meet the expectations of securities analysts our stock price would likely decline the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance 

 

tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and future tax liability could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory income tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory income tax rates changes in income tax rates changes in transfer pricing changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in us tax legislation and regulation foreign tax laws regulations and treaties exposure to additional tax liabilities changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by federal state and local tax authorities in the us and foreign countries such authorities may challenge positions we take and we are engaged in various proceedings with such authorities with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds and the results of these examinations judicial proceedings or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations in specific jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes however it is possible that the actual results of proceedings with tax authorities and in courts 

 

  changes in facts expiration of statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions will differ from the amounts we have accrued in either a positive or a negative manner which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the discussion that follows relates to our 52week fiscal years ended january 29 2011 fiscal 2011 and january 30 2010 fiscal 2010 and the 53week fiscal year ended january 31 2009 fiscal 2009 like most retailers we have a 53week fiscal year every five to six years this extra week of sales volume which also provides a lift to pretax margins due to the flow of certain monthly and annual expenses impacts comparisons to 52week fiscal years 

 

 

results of operations 

 

highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2011 include the following 

 

  

the following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results followed by a discussion of our segment operating results 

 

 

  net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal 2011 totaled 219 billion an 8 increase over net sales of 203 billion in fiscal 2010 the increase reflected a 4 increase from same store sales a 3 increase from new stores and a 1 increase from foreign currency exchange rates consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010 totaled 203 billion a 7 increase over net sales of 190 billion in fiscal 2009 the increase reflected a 6 increase from same store sales and a 4 increase from new stores offset by a 2 decline from the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a 1 decrease from the 53 rd week in fiscal 2009 

 

new stores have been a significant source of sales growth both our consolidated store count and our selling square footage increased by 4 in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and by 3 in fiscal 2010 over the prior fiscal year we expect to end fiscal 2012 with 2913 stores which would represent a 2 increase in both our consolidated store base and in our selling square footage the anticipated growth rate for fiscal 2012 will be negatively impacted by the closing of the 72 aj wright stores that will not be converted to other banners 

 

the 4 same store sales increase in fiscal 2011 was driven entirely by continued growth in transactions with the value of the average transaction down slightly for the year junior apparel jewelry and home fashions performed particularly well in fiscal 2011 geographically same store sales increases in canada were in line with the consolidated average while same store sales decreased in europe in the us sales were strong throughout the country with the west coast and southwest above the consolidated average and the northeast below the consolidated average 

 

the 6 same store sales increase in fiscal 2010 was driven by significant increases in customer transactions at all of our businesses partially offset by a decline in the value of the average transaction the increase in customer transactions accelerated during the course of fiscal 2010 junior apparel dresses children’s apparel footwear accessories and home fashions performed particularly well in fiscal 2010 geographically same store sales increases in europe and canada trailed the consolidated average in the us sales were strong throughout the country with the midwest southeast and west coast above the average and new england and florida below the average 

 

we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are in at least their third fiscal year of operation we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial same store sales of our foreign divisions are calculated on a constant currency basis meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of our foreign divisions at the same exchange rates used in the prior year this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which we believe is a more accurate measure of divisional operating performance 

 

the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales 

 

 

  

impact of foreign currency exchange rates our operating results are affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies two ways in which foreign currency affects our reported results are as follows 

 

translation of foreign operating results into us dollars in our financial statements we translate the operations of our segments in canada and europe from local currencies into us dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in 

 

  time significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales net income and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of our canadian and european segments currency translation generally does not affect operating margins as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at essentially the same rates within a given period 

 

inventory hedges we routinely enter into inventoryrelated hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins when our divisions principally in europe and canada purchase goods in currencies other than their local currencies as we have not elected “hedge accounting” as defined by us gaap we record a marktomarket gain or loss on the hedging instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period in subsequent periods the income statement impact of the marktomarket adjustment is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is sold while these effects occur every reporting period they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time the marktomarket adjustment on these hedges does not affect net sales but it does affect the cost of sales operating margins and earnings we report 

 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 731 in fiscal 2011 738 in fiscal 2010 and 759 in fiscal 2009 in fiscal 2011 the 02 percentage point negative impact of the fourth quarter aj wright segment loss was more than offset by improved consolidated merchandise margin which increased 05 percentage points along with expense leverage on the 4 same store sales increase merchandise margin improvement was driven by our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need leading to lower markdowns compared to the prior year 

 

the improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to improved consolidated merchandise margin which increased 21 percentage points along with expense leverage on the 6 same store sales increase particularly in occupancy costs which improved by 03 percentage points merchandise margin improvement was driven by our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need which resulted in an increase in markon along with a reduction in markdowns compared to the prior year these improvements were partially offset by a benefit to this expense ratio in fiscal 2009 due to the 53 rd week approximately 02 percentage points additionally for fiscal 2010 buying and occupancy expense leverage was offset by higher accruals for performancebased incentive compensation as a result of operating performance that was well ahead of our objectives 

 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 169 in fiscal 2011 164 in fiscal 2010 and 165 in fiscal 2009 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 was due to the 06 percentage point negative effect of the fourth quarter aj wright segment loss fiscal 2011 selling general and administrative expenses include impairment charges severance and termination benefits lease related obligations and other store closing costs in connection with the aj wright consolidation which was almost entirely offset by the benefit of cost reduction programs a reduction in our fiscal 2011 incentive compensation versus the prior year and expense leverage on strong same store sales in fiscal 2011 

 

the improvement in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due to levering of expenses and savings from our expense reduction initiatives these improvements were partially offset by the increase in performancebased incentive compensation which increased selling general and administrative expense ratio by 05 percentage points in fiscal 2010 

 

provision for computer intrusion related costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 we established a reserve to reflect our estimate of our probable losses in accordance with us gaap with respect to the computer intrusion 

 

we reduced the provision for computer intrusion related costs by 116 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of insurance proceeds and adjustments to our remaining reserve the reserve balance was 173 million at january 29 2011 as an estimate the reserve is subject to uncertainty actual costs may vary from the current estimate however such variations are not expected to be material to our results 

 

  interest expense net interest expense net amounted to 391 million for fiscal 2011 395 million for fiscal 2010 and 143 million for fiscal 2009 the components of interest expense net for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

 

 

 

gross interest expense and gross interest income for fiscal 2011 were flat to the prior period 

 

gross interest expense for fiscal 2010 increased over fiscal 2009 as a result of the incremental interest cost of the 375 million aggregate principal amount of 695 notes issued in april 2009 and the 400 million aggregate principal amount of 420 notes issued in july 2009 the 695 notes were issued in conjunction with the call for redemption of our zero coupon convertible securities and we refinanced our c235 million credit facility prior to its scheduled maturity with a portion of the proceeds of the 420 notes in addition interest income for fiscal 2010 was less than fiscal 2009 due to considerably lower rates of return on investments more than offsetting higher cash balances available for investment during fiscal 2010 

 

income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was 381 in fiscal 2011 378 in fiscal 2010 and 369 in fiscal 2009 the increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 is primarily attributable to the effects of repatriation of cash from europe and increasing state tax reserves partially offset by the finalization of an advance pricing agreement between canada and the united states related to our intercompany transfer pricing and a favorable canadian court ruling regarding withholding taxes 

 

the increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily attributed to the favorable impact in fiscal 2009 of a 19 million reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions arising from the settlement of several state tax audits the absence of this fiscal 2009 benefit increased the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2010 by 13 percentage points partially offset by a reduction in the effective income tax rate related to foreign income 

 

we anticipate an effective annual income tax rate for fiscal 2012 comparable to that for fiscal 2011 

 

income from continuing operations and income per share from continuing operations income from continuing operations was 13 billion in fiscal 2011 a 10 increase over the 12 billion in fiscal 2010 which in turn was a 33 increase over the 9149 million in fiscal 2009 comparisons between fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 are negatively impacted by 86 million for the after tax impact of the aj wright fourth quarter segment loss income from continuing operations per share was 330 in fiscal 2011 284 in fiscal 2010 and 208 in fiscal 2009 several items discussed below affected earnings per share comparisons for fiscal 2011 fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 

 

fiscal 2011 earnings per share were adversely affected by the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter segment loss for aj wright which reduced earnings per share by 021 per share offset in part by a 002 per share benefit for the fiscal 2011 reduction in the provision for the computer intrusion related costs 

 

fiscal 2009 earnings per share reflected an estimated 009 per share benefit from the 53 rd week in fiscal 2009 as well as a 004 per share benefit from the fiscal 2009 reduction in the provision for computer intrusion related costs 

 

foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results foreign currency exchange rates benefitted fiscal 2011 earnings per share by 002 per share compared to an immaterial impact in fiscal 2010 when comparing fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2009 foreign currency rates reduced earnings per share by 001 per share in fiscal 2010 compared to a 001 per share benefit in fiscal 2009 

 

in addition our weighted average diluted shares outstanding affect the comparability of earnings per share which are benefited by our share repurchase programs we repurchased 276 million shares of our stock at a cost of 12 billion in fiscal 2011 270 million shares at a cost of 950 million in fiscal 2010 and 240 million shares at a cost of 741 million in fiscal 2009 

 

  discontinued operations and net income the fiscal 2011 net gain from discontinued operations reflects an aftertax benefit of 36 million which did not impact earnings per share as a result of a 6 million pretax reduction for the estimated cost of settling leaserelated obligations of former businesses fiscal 2009 net loss from discontinued operations reflects an aftertax loss of 34 million or 008 per share on the sale of bob’s stores including the impact of discontinued operations net income was 13 billion or 330 per share for fiscal 2011 12 billion or 284 per share for fiscal 2010 and 8806 million or 200 per share for fiscal 2009 

 

segment information the following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments as of january 29 2011 we operated five business segments three in the united states and one in each of canada and europe in the united states our tj maxx and marshalls stores are aggregated as the marmaxx segment and homegoods and aj wright are each reported as a separate segment aj wright will cease to be a business segment during fiscal 2012 as a result of its consolidation tjx’s stores operated in canada winners homesense and stylesense are reported as the tjx canada segment and tjx’s stores operated in europe tk maxx and homesense are reported as the tjx europe segment we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income before general corporate expenses provision credit for computer intrusion related costs and interest expense “segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities in addition this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 

 

presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments 

 

 

us segments 

 

marmaxx 

 

 

 

net sales at marmaxx increased 6 in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 same store sales for marmaxx were up 4 which was on top of a strong 7 increase in the prior year 

 

same store sales growth at marmaxx for fiscal 2011 was driven by continued growth in customer transactions partially offset by a slight decrease in the value of the average transaction the growth in customer transactions in fiscal 2011 was on top of a significant increase in fiscal 2010 same store sales for women’s apparel were above the chain average with junior apparel particularly strong same store sales for men’s apparel were slightly below the chain average home categories improved significantly at marmaxx with same store sales increases above the chain average for fiscal 2011 geographically there were strong trends throughout the country same store sales were strongest in the west coast and southwest while the northeast trailed the chain average for fiscal 2011 we also saw a lift in the net sales of stores renovated during the year 

 

segment profit as a percentage of net sales “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” increased to 133 in fiscal 2011 from 120 in fiscal 2010 this increase in segment margin for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margin of 08 percentage points driven primarily by lower markdowns in addition the 4 increase in same 

 

  store sales provided expense leverage as a percentage of net sales particularly occupancy costs which improved by 02 percentage points 

 

segment margin increased to 120 in fiscal 2010 from 93 in fiscal 2009 this increase in segment margin for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margin of 24 percentage points driven by lower markdowns and higher markon in addition the 7 increase in same store sales provided expense leverage as a percentage of net sales particularly occupancy costs which improved by 03 percentage points these increases were partially offset by an increase in administrative costs as a percentage of sales primarily due to higher accruals for performancebased incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives 

 

we expect to open approximately 116 new stores net of closings and including the conversion of 65 aj wright stores in fiscal 2012 increasing the marmaxx store base and selling square footage each by 7 

 

homegoods 

 

 

 

homegoods’ net sales increased 9 in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 same store sales increased 6 in fiscal 2011 driven by continued strong growth in customer traffic compared to a same store sales increase of 9 in fiscal 2010 segment margin of 95 was up from 77 for fiscal 2010 due to increased merchandise margins driven by decreased markdowns levering of expenses on the 6 same store sales and operational efficiencies the merchandise margin improvements were driven by our continuing to manage this business with much lower inventory levels and increasing inventory turns 

 

homegoods’ net sales increased 14 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 same store sales increased 9 in fiscal 2010 driven by significantly increased customer traffic compared to a decrease of 3 in fiscal 2009 segment margin of 77 was up significantly from 27 for fiscal 2009 due to increased merchandise margins driven by increased markon and decreased markdowns levering of expenses on the 9 same store sales and operational efficiencies the merchandise margin improvements were driven by managing this business with much lower inventory levels which drove better offprice buying and increased inventory turns these improvements were partially offset by higher accruals for performancebased incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives 

 

in fiscal 2012 we plan to add a net of 38 homegoods stores including the conversion of 16 aj wright stores and increase selling square footage by 11 

 

aj wright 

 

in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 tjx announced that it would consolidate its aj wright division by converting 90 of the aj wright stores into tj maxx marshalls or homegoods stores and by closing the remaining 72 stores its two distribution centers and home office tjx commenced the liquidation process in the fiscal 2011 fourth quarter and 20 stores had been closed as of january 29 2011 all of the remaining stores ceased operation by february 13 2011 see note c to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

 

 

 

  a majority of the costs related to the closing of the aj wright business were recorded in the fourth quarter the operating results of the aj wright segment for the full year of fiscal 2011 include a fourth quarter loss of 1406 million which includes the following 

 

 

 

in the first half of fiscal 2012 tjx will incur additional store closing costs and operating losses due to the completion of the aj wright store closings as well as the costs to convert the aj wright stores to other tjx banners and grand reopening costs for those stores tjx estimates that during fiscal 2012 it will incur additional aj wright segment losses of approximately 66 million primarily relating to the completion of store operations and lease related obligations and conversion costs and grand reopening costs of approximately 28 million which will be reflected in the segments of the new banners into which the stores are converted the majority of these charges are expected to be incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 

 

aj wright’s net sales increased 15 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and same store sales increased 9 segment profit increased to 126 million in fiscal 2010 compared to segment profit of 29 million in fiscal 2009 the increase in segment margin in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to improved merchandise margin like our other divisions cost reduction initiatives and the benefit of expense leverage on the same store sales increase was partially offset by higher accruals for performancebased incentive compensation 

 

 

international segments 

 

tjx canada 

 

 

 

net sales for tjx canada which includes winners and homesense increased 16 in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 currency translation benefitted fiscal 2011 sales growth by approximately 9 percentage points as compared to the same period last year same store sales were up 4 in fiscal 2011 compared to an increase of 2 in fiscal 2010 same store sales of men’s apparel dresses and home fashions were above the segment average for fiscal 2011 

 

segment profit for fiscal 2011 increased to 352 million compared to 255 million in fiscal 2010 the impact of foreign currency translation increased segment profit by 25 million in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 the marktomarket adjustment on inventoryrelated hedges reduced segment profit in fiscal 2011 by 7 million compared to an immaterial impact in fiscal 2010 the unfavorable change in the marktomarket adjustment of our inventory hedges reduced fiscal 2011 segment margin by 03 percentage points tjx canada segment margin increased 22 percentage 

 

  points to 140 in fiscal 2011 compared to 118 in fiscal 2010 the segment margin improvement in fiscal 2011 was driven by a strong improvement in merchandise margins 

 

net sales increased 1 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 currency exchange translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by approximately 62 million or 3 as compared to fiscal 2009 same store sales were up 2 in fiscal 2010 compared to an increase of 3 in fiscal 2009 same store sales of junior apparel dresses men’s apparel and footwear as well as homesense on a standalone basis were above the segment average for fiscal 2010 

 

segment profit for fiscal 2010 increased to 255 million compared to 236 million in fiscal 2009 the impact of foreign currency translation decreased segment profit by 4 million or 2 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the marktomarket adjustment on inventory related hedges did not have a material impact on segment profit in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 segment margin increased 08 percentage points to 118 in fiscal 2010 compared to 110 in fiscal 2009 which was primarily due to an improvement in merchandise margins improvements in store payroll and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 due to operating efficiencies were offset by higher accruals for performancebased incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives 

 

as of the end of fiscal 2011 we operated three stylesense stores which are included in the winners totals in the above table we are bringing the marshalls chain to canada with six stores scheduled to open in fiscal 2012 we believe that canada can ultimately support 90 to 100 marshalls stores we expect to add a net of 15 stores in canada in fiscal 2012 including the marshalls stores and plan to increase selling square footage by 5 

 

tjx europe 

 

 

 

net sales for tjx europe increased in fiscal 2011 to 25 billion compared to 23 billion in fiscal 2010 currency translation negatively impacted the fiscal 2011 results reducing net sales by 86 million same store sales were down 3 in fiscal 2011 compared to a 5 increase in fiscal 2010 

 

segment profit decreased to 758 million for fiscal 2011 and segment profit margin decreased to 30 we believe that execution issues at tjx europe were the primary reasons for belowplan sales and segment profit we believe that our expansion in europe took management’s focus off of the proper execution of the fundamentals of our offprice strategy and that as a result consumers did not find the values they had come to expect at our stores this led to same store sales declines reduced merchandise margins as a result of increased markdowns and the delevering of expenses we intend to slow store growth for tjx europe in fiscal 2012 and focus on correcting the execution issues despite this setback we remain confident that europe holds significant growth potential for tjx 

 

net sales for tjx europe increased in fiscal 2010 to 23 billion compared to 22 billion in fiscal 2009 currency exchange rate translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by approximately 252 million or 11 as compared to fiscal 2009 same store sales increased 5 for fiscal 2010 compared to a 4 increase in fiscal 2009 segment profit for fiscal 2010 increased 19 to 164 million and segment profit margin increased 11 percentage points to 72 the increase in segment margin for fiscal 2010 reflects improved merchandise margins and leverage of expenses on the 5 same store sales increase partially offset by costs of operations in germany and poland along with higher accruals for performance based incentive compensation in fiscal 2010 we also invested in strengthening our shared services infrastructure 

 

  foreign currency had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2010 segment profit while segment profit for fiscal 2009 included a favorable marktomarket adjustment of 10 million primarily relating to the conversion of euros to pound sterling 

 

as stated above we intend to slow our growth in fiscal 2012 we plan to open a net of 27 new tk maxx stores in europe and to expand total tjx europe selling square footage by 8 this compares to a net increase of 54 stores and an 18 increase in selling square footage in fiscal 2011 

 

general corporate expense 

 

 

 

general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling general and administrative expenses except for the marktomarket adjustment on diesel fuel hedges which is included in cost of sales fiscal 2011 general corporate expense was relatively flat to the prior year the slight increase in fiscal 2011 was due to increased investment in corporate systems management training programs and normal expense growth offsetting the effect of higher charitable donations and incentive compensation incurred in fiscal 2010 the increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was primarily due to an 18 million contribution to the tjx foundation in fiscal 2010 and higher performancebased incentive and benefit plan accruals partially offset by benefits related to hedging activity 

 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1976 million in fiscal 2011 2272 million in fiscal 2010 and 1155 million in fiscal 2009 the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings 

 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2011 decreased 295 million compared to fiscal 2010 net income plus the noncash impact of depreciation and impairment charges provided cash of 1897 million in fiscal 2011 compared to 1659 in fiscal 2010 an increase of 238 million the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of 48 million in fiscal 2011 compared to a source of cash of 345 million in fiscal 2010 although we continued to operate with leaner inventories throughout fiscal 2011 our strategy of being more aggressive with managing inventories had a much greater impact on cash flows in fiscal 2010 in addition the increase in inventory in fiscal 2011 reflected our business growth as well as a yearend increase in packaway merchandise to take advantage of market opportunities changes in current income taxes payablerecoverable unfavorably impacted fiscal 2011 cash flows as compared to fiscal 2010 by 203 million due to the timing of tax payments the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities provided cash of 78 million in fiscal 2011 compared to cash provided of 31 million in fiscal 2010 

 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2010 increased 1117 million compared to fiscal 2009 net income provided cash of 1214 million in fiscal 2010 an increase of 333 million over net income of 881 million in fiscal 2009 the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable provided a source of cash of 345 million in fiscal 2010 compared to a 210 million use of cash in fiscal 2009 the reduction in inventory in fiscal 2010 was the result of the ongoing implementation of our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need which in turn increased inventory turnover changes in current income taxes payablerecoverable increased cash in fiscal 2010 by 191 million compared to a decrease in cash of 49 million in fiscal 2009 the change in prepaid expenses and other current assets had a favorable impact on fiscal 2010 cash flows of 64 million primarily due to the timing of february rental payments the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities provided cash of 31 million in fiscal 2010 compared to a 35 million use of cash in fiscal 2009 reflecting higher accruals in fiscal 2010 for performancebased incentive compensation partially offset by increased funding of the pension plan partially offsetting these favorable changes to fiscal 2010 operating cash flows was the change in the deferred income tax provision which reduced cash flows by 79 million compared to fiscal 2009 and the unfavorable impact of 61 million of all other items which primarily reflects unrealized gains on assets of the executive savings plan in fiscal 2010 versus unrealized losses in fiscal 2009 

 

reserve for obligations of former operations we have a reserve for the remaining future obligations of businesses we have closed sold or otherwise disposed of including among others bob’s stores and aj wright the 

 

  majority of these obligations relate to real estate leases associated with these businesses the reserve balance was 547 million at january 29 2011 and 359 million at january 30 2010 see note c to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

 

we may also be contingently liable on up to 13 leases of bj’s wholesale club a former tjx business and up to seven leases of bob’s stores in addition to those included in the reserve the reserve for former operations does not reflect these leases because we do not believe that the likelihood of future liability to us is probable 

 

offbalance sheet liabilities we have contingent obligations on leases for which we were a lessee or guarantor which were assigned to third parties without tjx being released by the landlords over many years we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties with the exception of leases of our former businesses for which we have reserved we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases and accordingly we do not expect that such leases will have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them that could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants do not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases 

 

we also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate we estimate the undiscounted obligations of i leases of former operations not included in our reserve for former operations and ii properties of our discontinued operations that we would expect to sublet if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations is approximately 75 million as of january 29 2011 we believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to us and to the extent they do will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors 

 

we are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold specified environmental matters or certain income taxes these obligations are typically limited in time and amount there are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations 

 

investing activities 

 

our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below 

 

 

 

we expect that capital expenditures will approximate 800 million to 825 million for fiscal 2012 which we expect to fund through internally generated funds fiscal 2012 capital expenditures are expected to include 239 million for new stores 55 million of which is associated with converting the 90 aj wright stores to other banners additionally 269 million is for our offices and distribution centers to support growth and 317 million is for store renovations 

 

we also purchased shortterm investments that had initial maturities in excess of 90 days which per our policy are not classified as cash on the balance sheets presented in fiscal 2011 we purchased 120 million of such shortterm investments compared to 279 million in fiscal 2010 additionally 180 million of such shortterm investments were sold or matured during fiscal 2011 compared to 153 million last year no such shortterm investments were held during fiscal 2009 investing activities for fiscal 2009 also include cash flows associated with net investment hedges during fiscal 2009 we suspended our policy of hedging the net investment in our foreign subsidiaries and settled such hedges during the fourth quarter of that year the net cash received on net investment hedges during fiscal 2009 amounted to 144 million 

 

 

  financing activities 

 

cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 1224 million in fiscal 2011 584 million in fiscal 2010 and 769 million in fiscal 2009 

 

we spent 1200 million to repurchase and retire 276 million shares of our stock in fiscal 2011 950 million to repurchase and retire 270 million shares in fiscal 2010 and 741 million to repurchase and retire 240 million shares in fiscal 2009 under our stock repurchase programs we record the purchase of our stock on a cash basis and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our repurchases during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we completed the 1 billion stock repurchase program approved in september 2009 and initiated another 1 billion stock repurchase program approved in february 2010 as of january 29 2011 594 million remained available for purchase under that program and in february 2011 our board of directors authorized an additional 1 billion stock repurchase program we currently plan to repurchase approximately 12 billion of stock under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal 2012 we determine the timing and amount of repurchases made directly and under rule 10b51 plans from time to time based on our assessment of various factors including anticipated excess cash flow liquidity market conditions the economic environment and prospects for the business and other factors the timing and amount of these purchases may change from our plans 

 

cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2010 include the net proceeds of 774 million from two debt offerings on april 7 2009 we issued 375 million aggregate principal amount of 695 tenyear notes related to this transaction tjx called for the redemption of its zero coupon convertible subordinated notes virtually all of which were converted into 151 million shares of common stock we used the proceeds of the 695 notes to repurchase additional shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program on july 23 2009 we issued 400 million aggregate principal amount of 420 sixyear notes we used a portion of the proceeds of this offering to refinance our c235 million term credit facility on august 10 2009 prior to its scheduled maturity and used the remainder together with funds from operations to pay our 745 notes on their scheduled maturity of december 15 2009 

 

we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 060 per share in fiscal 2011 048 per share in fiscal 2010 and 044 per share in fiscal 2009 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 229 million in fiscal 2011 198 million in fiscal 2010 and 177 million in fiscal 2009 we announced our intention to increase the quarterly dividend on our common stock to 019 per share effective with the dividend payable in june 2011 subject to the approval of our board of directors financing activities also included proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of 176 million in fiscal 2011 170 million in fiscal 2010 and 142 million in fiscal 2009 

 

we traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of shortterm commercial paper as of january 29 2011 we had a 500 million revolving credit facility maturing in may 2013 and a 500 million revolving credit facility maturing in may 2011 the threeyear agreement maturing in may 2013 was entered into in may 2010 to replace a similar agreement that matured at that time the threeyear agreement requires the payment of 175 basis points annually on the unused committed amount the agreement maturing in may 2011 requires the payment of six basis points annually on the committed amount whether used or unused both of these agreements have no compensating balance requirements contain various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings and serve as back up to tjx’s commercial paper program the availability under our revolving credit facilities was 1 billion at january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 and we had no borrowings outstanding at those dates under these agreements we believe existing cash balances internallygenerated funds and our revolving credit facilities will meet our future operating needs the maximum amount of our us shortterm borrowings outstanding was 165 million during fiscal 2010 there were no us shortterm borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2011 

 

as of january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 tjx’s foreign subsidiaries had uncommitted credit facilities tjx canada had two credit lines a c10 million facility for operating expenses and a c10 million letter of credit facility as of january 29 2011 and january 30 2010 there were no amounts outstanding on the canadian credit line for operating expenses as of january 29 2011 tjx europe had a credit line of £20 million there were no outstanding borrowings on this european credit line as of january 29 2011 or january 30 2010 

 

we believe that internallygenerated funds and our current credit facilities will adequately meet our operating debt and capital needs for at least the next twelve months see note k to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our longterm debt and other financing sources 

 

  contractual obligations as of january 29 2011 we had payment obligations including current installments under longterm debt arrangements leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows in thousands 

 

 

 

the longterm debt obligations above include estimated interest costs the lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance real estate taxes other operating expenses and in some cases rentals based on a percentage of sales these items totaled approximately onethird of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended january 29 2011 

 

our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise purchase orders for capital expenditures supplies and other operating needs commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services and commitments under executive employment and other agreements we exclude from purchase obligations longterm agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty 

 

we also have longterm liabilities which include 2090 million for employee compensation and benefits the majority of which will come due beyond five years 1653 million for accrued rent the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table and 1798 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid 

 

 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results these judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and other factors which we continually review and believe are reasonable we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to the areas described below 

 

inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory which results in a weighted average cost under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory this method is widely used in the retail industry and we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other inventory accounting methods it involves management estimates with regard to markdowns and inventory shrinkage under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced typically a significant area of judgment in the retail method is the amount and timing of permanent markdowns however as a normal business practice we have a specific policy as to when and how markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing management’s discretion and the need for management estimates as to markdowns inventory shrinkage requires estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but we take a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end to determine shrinkage at year end thus actual and estimated amounts of shrinkage may differ in quarterly results but the difference is typically not a significant factor in full year results overall we believe that the retail method coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and the full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated lastly many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions that ultimately affect the value of inventory we have generally not entered into such arrangements with our vendors in our continuing operations 

 

impairment of longlived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those 

 

  assets are not recoverable significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores as well as our business units which involve a number of factors including historical trends recent performance and general economic assumptions if we determine that an impairment of longlived assets has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets we believe as of january 29 2011 that the carrying value of our longlived assets was appropriate 

 

retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates we are required to make assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the longterm rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period the discount rate which we determine annually based on market interest rates and our estimated longterm rate of return which can differ considerably from actual returns are two factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan when the market performance of our plan assets discount rates or other factors have a negative impact on the funded status of our plan we may make contributions to the plan in excess of mandatory funding requirements in fiscal 2011 we funded our qualified pension plan with a voluntary contribution of 100 million 

 

sharebased compensation in accordance with us gaap we estimate the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under our stock incentive plan the fair value of the awards is amortized as “sharebased compensation” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service we use the blackscholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates the use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related compensation cost 

 

casualty insurance in fiscal 2008 we initiated a fixed premium program for our casualty insurance previously our casualty insurance program required us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost the estimated claims are developed with the assistance of an actuary based on historical experience and other factors these estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates a large portion of these claims is funded with a nonrefundable payment during the policy year offsetting our estimated claims accrual we had a net accrual of 142 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of january 29 2011 

 

income taxes like many large corporations our income tax returns are regularly audited by federal state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign countries where we operate such authorities may challenge positions we take and we are engaged in various proceedings with such authorities with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds in accordance with us gaap we evaluate uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the positions will not be sustained upon examination however it is possible that amounts accrued or paid as the result of the final resolutions of examinations judicial or administrative proceedings changes in facts or law expirations of statute of limitations in specific jurisdictions or other resolutions of or changes in tax positions will differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued and may result in accruals or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made it is possible that such final resolutions or changes in accruals could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the period in which an examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

 

reserves for computer intrusion related costs and for former operations as discussed in notes b and c to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the management’s discussion and analysis we have reserves for probable losses arising out of the computer intrusion and for future obligations of former operations primarily real estate leases we must make estimates and assumptions about the costs and expenses we will incur in connection with the computer intrusion and in connection with the future obligations of our former operations the leases relating to aj wright and other former businesses are longterm obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including when and on what terms we will assign the lease or sublease the leased properties whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors including indemnification may exist to any liability we may have we develop these assumptions based on past experience and evaluation of various potential outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location we 

 

  believe that our reserves are reasonable estimates of the most likely outcomes of the future obligations arising out of the computer intrusion and the future obligations of our former operations and should be adequate to cover the ultimate costs we will incur however actual results may differ from our current estimates and we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for future developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors although we do not expect any such differences to be material to our results of operations 

 

loss contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our management with the assistance of our legal counsel assesses such contingent liabilities such assessments inherently involve the exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be reasonably estimated we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 

we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our canadian and european operations on the translation of these foreign operations into the us dollar and on purchases of goods in currencies that are not the local currencies of stores where the goods are sold as more fully described in note f to our consolidated financial statements we hedge a portion of our intercompany transactions with foreign operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations with derivative financial instruments we enter into derivative contracts only for the purpose of hedging an underlying economic exposure we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency as of january 29 2011 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pretax income for fiscal 2011 by approximately 43 million 

 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our cash equivalents shortterm investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by us in addition changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest expense we periodically enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing however we believe that fixed interest rates on most of our debt minimizes our exposure to changes in market conditions we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates applied to our maximum variable rate debt outstanding and to our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of january 29 2011 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement as of that date would not have had a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

   

equity price risk 

 

the assets of our qualified pension plan a large portion of which are equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets we invest the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties investments in general are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility risks a significant decline in the financial markets can adversely affect the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our pension plan resulting in increased contributions to the plan

flexible business model our offprice business model is flexible particularly for a company of our size allowing us to react to market trends our opportunistic buying and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to adjust our assortments more frequently than traditional retailers and our stores and distribution centers are built and designed to support this flexibility by maintaining a liquid inventory position our merchants can buy close to need enabling them to buy into current market trends and to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace buying close to need gives us the ability to turn our inventory more rapidly and adjust our pricing to the current market more frequently than conventional retailers our selling floor space is flexible without walls between departments and largely free of permanent fixtures so we can easily expand and contract departments in response to customer demand available merchandise and fashion trends our distribution facilities are designed to accommodate our methods of receiving and shipping both small and large quantities of product to our large store base quickly and efficiently 

 

opportunistic buying we are differentiated from traditional retailers by our opportunistic buying of quality brand name merchandise we purchase the majority of our apparel inventory and a significant portion of our home fashion inventory opportunistically and purchase virtually all of our inventory at discounts from initial wholesale prices our merchant organization numbers over 700 and we operate 12 buying offices in the us and abroad we continue to open many new vendors each year sourcing from a vendor universe of over 12000 in fiscal 2010 in contrast to traditional retailers which typically order goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor our merchants are in the marketplace virtually every week buying primarily for the current selling season and to a limited extent for a future selling season 

 

we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining adequate amounts of quality inventory for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments and believe that we will continue to have adequate inventory as we continue to grow buying later in the inventory cycle than traditional retailers and maintaining flexibility in adapting to changing conditions we are able to take advantage of opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts such as order cancellations and manufacturer overruns which regularly arise from the routine flow of inventory in the highly fragmented apparel and home fashions marketplace as a result we are able to buy the vast majority of our inventory opportunistically and directly from manufacturers with some coming from retailers and other sources a small percentage of the merchandise we sell is private label merchandise produced specifically for us by third party manufacturers 

 

we believe a number of factors make us an attractive outlet for the vendor community and provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise we are willing to purchase lessthanfull assortments of items styles and sizes pay promptly and do not ask for typical retail concessions such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries or return privileges we are able to purchase quantities of inventory that range from small to very large and we have the ability to sell product through a geographically diverse network of stores importantly in tjx we offer vendors an outlet with financial strength and an excellent credit rating 

 

inventory management we offer our customers a rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a “treasure hunt” experience in our stores to achieve this we seek to rapidly turn the inventory in our stores regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions at excellent values our specialized inventory planning purchasing monitoring and markdown systems coupled with distribution center storage processing handling and shipping systems enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local preferences achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of products and sell substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods we make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations centrally using information provided by specialized computer 

 

systems designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner we do not generally engage in promotional pricing activity 

 

low cost operations we operate with a low cost structure compared to many other traditional retailers we focus aggressively on expenses throughout our business our advertising budget as a percentage of sales is low compared to traditional retailers we design our stores generally located in community shopping centers to provide a pleasant convenient shopping environment but do not spend heavily on store fixtures additionally our distribution network is designed to run cost effectively we continue to pursue cost saving strategies in areas such as nonmerchandise procurement operating efficiencies in our distribution centers and stores as well as efficiencies in our supply chain 

 

customer service while we offer a selfservice format we train our store associates to provide friendly and helpful customer service we also have customerfriendly return policies we accept a variety of payment methods including cash credit cards and debit cards in the us we offer a cobranded tjx credit card and a private label credit card both through a major bank but do not maintain customer credit receivables related to either program 

 

distribution we operate 13 distribution centers in the us 2 in canada and 4 in the uk our distribution centers encompass approximately 11 million square feet we ship substantially all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers which are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model as well as warehouses operated by third parties we shipped approximately 16 billion units to our stores during fiscal 2010

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks that follow individually or in the aggregate are those that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements 

 

global economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance 

 

in 2009 economies worldwide were in crisis and global financial markets experienced extreme volatility disruption and credit contraction the volatility and disruption to the capital markets significantly adversely affected global economic conditions resulting in additional significant recessionary pressures and declines in employment levels disposable income and actual and perceived wealth although there has been some recent improvement continuing or worsened adverse economic conditions including higher unemployment energy and health care costs interest rates and taxes and tighter credit could continue to affect consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending adversely and may adversely affect our sales cash flows and results of operations additionally renewed financial turmoil in the financial and credit markets could adversely affect our costs of capital and the sources of liquidity available to us and could increase our pension funding requirements 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

 

in addition to our us businesses we operate stores in canada and europe and plan to continue to expand our international operations sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and changes in foreign exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into us dollars for financial reporting purposes because of this movements in exchange rates have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our net sales and earnings 

 

additionally we routinely enter into inventoryrelated hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange on merchandise margins of merchandise purchased by our international segments that is denominated in currencies other than their local currencies in accordance with us gaap we evaluate the fair value of these hedging instruments and make marktomarket adjustments at the end of an accounting period these adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our earnings 

 

in addition changes in foreign exchange rates can increase the cost of inventory purchases by our businesses that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the business when these changes occur suddenly it can be difficult for us to adjust retail prices accordingly and gross margin can be adversely affected 

 

although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates we expect that foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations 

 

 

failure to execute our opportunistic buying and inventory management could adversely affect our business 

 

we purchase the majority of our apparel inventory and much of our home inventory opportunistically with our buyers purchasing close to need to drive traffic to the stores and to increase same store sales the treasure hunt nature of the offprice buying experience requires continued replenishment of fresh high quality attractively priced merchandise in our stores while opportunistic buying provides our buyers the ability to buy at desirable times and prices in the quantities we need and into market trends it places considerable discretion in our buyers subjecting us to risks on the timing pricing quantity and nature of inventory flowing to the stores in addition we base our purchases of inventory in part on sales forecasts if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand we may experience higher inventory levels and decreased profit margins if we have excess or slowmoving inventory or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand either of which could adversely affect our financial performance in addition to acquiring inventory we must properly execute our inventory management strategies through effectively allocating merchandise among our stores timely and efficiently distributing inventory to stores maintaining an appropriate mix and level of inventory in stores appropriately changing the allocation of floor space of stores among product categories to respond to customer demand and effectively managing pricing and markdowns failure to execute our opportunistic inventory buying and inventory management well could adversely affect our performance and our relationship with our customers 

 

failure to continue to expand our operations successfully could adversely affect our financial results 

 

we have steadily expanded the number of concepts and stores we operate our revenue growth is dependent among other things upon our ability to continue to expand successfully through new store openings as well as our ability to increase same store sales successful store growth requires acquisition and development of appropriate real estate including selection of store locations in appropriate geographies availability of attractive stores or store sites in such locations and negotiation of acceptable terms competition for desirable sites increases in real estate construction and development costs and availability and costs of capital could limit our ability to open new stores in desirable locations in the future or adversely affect the economics of new stores we may encounter difficulties in attracting customers in new markets for various reasons including customers’ lack of familiarity with our brands or our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and cultural differences new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores and new and existing stores in a market area may adversely affect each other’s sales and profitability further expansion places significant demands on the administrative merchandising store operations distribution and other organizations in our businesses to manage rapid growth and we may not do so successfully 

 

failure to successfully identify customer trends and preferences to meet customer demand could negatively impact our performance 

 

because our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand we take various steps to keep up with customer trends and preferences including contacts with vendors monitoring product category and fashion trends and comparison shopping our flexible business model allows us to buy close to need and in response to consumer preferences and trends and to expand and contract merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing tastes however identifying consumer trends and preferences and successfully meeting customer demand is challenging and we may not successfully do so which could adversely affect our results 

 

our quarterly operating results can be subject to significant fluctuations and may fall short of either a prior quarter or investors’ expectations 

 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past and they may continue to do so in the future our earnings may not continue to grow at rates we plan and may fall short of either a prior quarter or investors’ expectations if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline factors that could cause us not to meet our securities analysts’ or investors’ earnings expectations include some factors that are within our control such as the execution of our offprice buying selection pricing and mix of merchandise and inventory management including flow markon and markdowns and some factors that are not within our control including actions of competitors weather conditions economic conditions consumer confidence and seasonality in addition if we do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplate pursuant to our stock repurchase program our earnings per share may be adversely affected most of our operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not vary directly with the amount of sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term as a result if sales in a particular 

 

quarter are below expectations for that quarter we may not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter and therefore such a sales shortfall would have a disproportionate effect on our net income for the quarter we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to project sales and align expenses if we do not correctly forecast sales or appropriately adjust to actual results our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 

our future performance is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand within our existing markets and to extend our offprice model in new product lines chains and geographic regions 

 

our strategy is to continue to expand within existing markets and to expand to new markets and geographies this growth strategy includes developing new ways to sell more or different merchandise within our existing stores continued expansion of our existing chains in our existing markets and countries expansion of these chains to new markets and countries and development and opening of new chains all of which entail significant risk our growth is dependent upon our ability to successfully extend our offprice retail apparel and home fashions concepts in these ways unsuccessful extension of our model could adversely affect future growth or financial performance 

 

failure to implement our marketing advertising and promotional programs successfully or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are may adversely affect our revenue 

 

we use marketing advertising and promotional programs to attract customers to our stores we use various media for these programs including print television database marketing and direct marketing some of our competitors may have substantially larger expenditures for their programs which may provide them with a competitive advantage there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to execute our marketing advertising and promotional programs effectively and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 

 

compromises of our data security could materially harm our reputation and business 

 

in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store certain personal information from individuals such as our customers and associates and we process customer payment card and check information we suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions such intrusion or intrusions collectively the “computer intrusion” into portions of our computer system that process and store information related to customer transactions discovered late in fiscal 2007 in which we believe customer data were stolen we have taken steps designed to further strengthen the security of our computer system and protocols and have instituted an ongoing program with respect to data security consistent with a consent order with the federal trade commission nevertheless there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a future data compromise we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential information further the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk are determined and controlled by the payment card industry not by us this is also true for check information and approval computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer system and if successful misappropriate personal information payment card or check information or confidential company business information in addition a company associate contractor or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information may or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology new tools and other developments may increase the risk of such a breach any such compromise of our data security and loss of personal or business information could disrupt our operations damage our reputation and customers’ willingness to shop in our stores violate applicable laws regulations orders and agreements and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material 

 

our business is subject to seasonal influences a decrease in sales or margins during the second half of the year could disproportionately adversely affect our operating results 

 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we generally realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the year which includes the backtoschool and yearend holiday seasons any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

 

we may experience risks associated with our substantial size and scale 

 

we operate eight retail chains in the us canada and europe some aspects of the businesses and operations of the chains are conducted with relative autonomy the large size of our operations our multiple businesses and the autonomy afforded to the chains increase the risk that systems and practices will not be implemented uniformly throughout our company and that information will not be appropriately shared across different chains and countries 

 

unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate or our distribution centers are located could adversely affect our operating results 

 

adverse and unseasonable weather affects customers’ willingness to shop and their demand for the merchandise in our stores severe weather could also affect our ability to transport merchandise to our stores from our distribution centers as a result frequent unusually heavy unseasonable or untimely weather in our markets such as snow ice or rain storms severe cold or heat or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures could adversely affect our sales and increase markdowns 

 

our results may be adversely affected by serious disruptions or catastrophic events 

 

unforeseen public health issues such as pandemics and epidemics as well as natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods earthquakes and other adverse weather and climate conditions whether occurring in the united states or abroad could disrupt the operations of one or more of our vendors or could severely damage or destroy one or more of our stores or distribution facilities located in the affected areas our ability to receive products from our vendors or transport products to our stores could be adversely affected or we could be required to close stores or distribution centers in the affected areas or in areas served by the affected distribution center as a result our business could be adversely affected 

 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

 

the retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive we compete with many other local regional national and international retailers that sell apparel home fashions and other merchandise that we sell whether in stores through catalogues or media or over the internet we compete on the basis of fashion quality price value merchandise selection and freshness brand name recognition service reputation and store location other competitive factors that influence the demand for our merchandise include our advertising marketing and promotional activities and the name recognition and reputation of our chains if we fail to compete effectively our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

failure to attract and retain quality sales distribution center and other associates in appropriate numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel could adversely affect our performance 

 

our performance depends on recruiting developing training and retaining quality sales distribution center and other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel many of our associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover the nature of the workforce in the retail industry subjects us to the risk of immigration law violations which risk has increased in recent years our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates minimum wage legislation changing demographics health and other insurance costs and governmental labor and employment requirements in the event of increasing wage rates if we fail to increase our wages competitively the quality of our workforce could decline causing our customer service to suffer while increasing our wages could cause our earnings to decrease in addition certain associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must do significant internal training and development for a substantial number of our associates the market for retail management is highly competitive and in common with other retailers we face challenges in securing sufficient management talent if we do not continue to attract and retain quality associates and management personnel our performance could be adversely affected 

 

 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions of new businesses or divest any of our current businesses our business will be subject to additional risks 

 

we have grown our business in part through mergers and acquisitions and may acquire new businesses or divest current businesses acquisition or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses we may do a lessthanoptimal job of evaluating target companies and their risks and benefits and integration of acquisitions can be difficult and timeconsuming acquisitions may not meet our performance and other expectations or may expose us to unexpected or greaterthanexpected liabilities and risks divestiture also involves risks such as the risks of exposure on lease obligations obligations undertaken in the disposition and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of the acquirer failure to execute on mergers or divestitures in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 

 

failure to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

 

the efficient operation and successful growth of our business depends on our information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to select and implement new technologies systems controls and adequate disaster recovery systems successfully the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm our profitability 

 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to supply capital to fund our expansion operations interest and debt repayment stock repurchases and dividends 

 

our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash flow and to some extent upon the availability of financing sources to supply capital to fund our expansions general operating activities stock repurchases dividends interest and debt repayment our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of availability of financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms when needed could adversely affect our financial performance including our earnings per share 

 

general economic and other factors may adversely affect consumer spending which could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

 

interest rates recession inflation deflation consumer credit availability consumer debt levels energy costs tax rates and policy unemployment trends threats or possibilities of war terrorism or other global or national unrest actual or threatened epidemics political or financial instability and general economic political and other factors beyond our control have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending consumer spending in turn affects sales at retailers which may include tjx although we benefit from being an offprice retailer these factors could adversely affect our sales and performance if we are not able to implement strategies to mitigate them promptly and successfully 

 

issues with merchandise quality or safety could damage our reputation sales and financial results 

 

various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where we do business regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we sell in our stores regulations and standards in this area including those related to the consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 in the united states may change from time to time our inability to comply on a timely basis with regulatory requirements could result in significant fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results issues with the quality and safety and genuineness of merchandise regardless of our fault or customer concerns about such issues could cause damage to our reputation and could result in lost sales uninsured product liability claims or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs and regulatory civil or criminal fines or penalties any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

 

we are subject to import risks associated with importing merchandise from abroad 

 

many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a limited extent by us in many foreign countries as a result we are subject to the various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad such as 

 

  

political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates labor conditions transport capacity and costs compliance with us and foreign laws and regulations and other factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise beyond our control could affect the availability and the price of our inventory furthermore although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad there can be no assurance that our associates contractors agents vendors or other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies which could adversely affect our operations or operating results 

 

our expanding international operations increasingly expose us to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions 

 

we have a significant retail presence in canada and europe as well as buying offices around the world and our goal as a global retailer is to continue to expand into other international markets in the future our foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by our us operations as well as risks inherent in foreign operations such as understanding the retail climate and trends local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets complying with foreign laws rules and regulations and foreign currency fluctuations which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

 

our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price of oil 

 

prices of oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers continued volatility in oil prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have an adverse effect on our performance 

 

failure to comply with existing laws regulations and orders or changes in existing laws and regulations could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

 

we are subject to federal state provincial and local laws rules and regulations in the united states and abroad any of which may change from time to time as well as orders and assurances if we fail to comply with these laws rules regulations and orders we may be subject to fines or other penalties which could materially adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition we must also comply with new and changing laws further us gaap may change from time to time and these changes could have material effects on our reported financial results and condition in addition there have been a large number of new legislative and regulatory initiatives and reforms introduced in the us and the initiatives and reforms that have been and may be enacted may increase our costs 

 

 

our results may be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of litigation and other legal proceedings 

 

we are periodically involved in various legal proceedings which may involve local state and federal government inquiries and investigations tax employment real estate tort consumer litigation and intellectual property litigation or other disputes in addition we may be subject to investigations and other proceedings by regulatory agencies including but not limited to consumer protection laws advertising regulations escheat and employment and wage and hour regulations results of legal and regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and may differ from reserves we make estimating the probable outcome regardless of merit litigation may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant expense and diversion of management attention legal and regulatory proceedings and investigations could expose us to significant defense costs fines penalties and liability to private parties and governmental entities for monetary recoveries and other amounts and attorneys’ fees andor require us to change aspects of our operations any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

our real estate leases generally obligate us for long periods which subjects us to various financial risks 

 

we lease virtually all of our store locations generally for long terms and either own or lease for long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices accordingly we are subject to the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions by making specified payments we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so if we decide to close stores we may be required to continue to perform obligations under the applicable leases which may include among other things paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or paying to exercise rights to terminate and the performance of any of these obligations may be expensive when we assign or sublease leases we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform in addition when leases expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close stores 

 

our stock price may fluctuate based on market expectations 

 

the public trading of our stock is based in large part on market expectations that our business will continue to grow and that we will achieve certain levels of net income if the securities analysts that regularly follow our stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance the market price of our stock is likely to drop in addition if our quarterly financial performance does not meet the expectations of securities analysts our stock price would likely decline the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance 

 

 

tax matters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

 

we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including but not limited to income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in us tax legislation and regulation foreign tax laws regulations and treaties exposure to additional tax liabilities changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by federal state and local tax authorities in the us and foreign countries such authorities may challenge positions we take and we are engaged in various proceedings with such authorities with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds and the results of these examinations judicial proceedings or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations in specific jurisdictions we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes however it is possible that the actual results of proceedings with tax authorities and in courts changes in facts expiration of statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions will differ from the amounts we have accrued in either a positive or a negative manner which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the discussion that follows relates to our 52week fiscal year ended january 30 2010 fiscal 2010 the 53week fiscal year ended january 31 2009 fiscal 2009 and the 52week fiscal year ended january 26 2008 fiscal 2008 like most retailers we have a 53week fiscal period every five to six years this extra week of sales volume which also provides a lift to pretax margins due to the flow of certain monthly and annual expenses impacts comparisons to other fiscal periods 

 

 

results of operations 

 

we entered fiscal 2010 faced with the challenges of a worldwide recession and established a threepronged strategy for managing through the challenging economic times conservatively plan same store sales allowing better flowthrough to the bottom line if we exceed plans run with very lean inventories and buy closer to need than in the past increasing inventory turns and protecting gross margins and focus on costcutting measures and controlling expenses implementing this strategy has proven successful and we posted results significantly above our expectations and ahead of last year on a consolidated basis and for each of our businesses customer traffic increased as the year progressed driving sales additionally we took advantage of opportunities the environment presented opening more new stores than planned and adding many new vendors we are confident in our ability to continue to grow both sales and earnings in fiscal 2011 driving market share with our value proposition and continuing the marketing inventory management and cost reduction strategies that were successful in fiscal 2010 

 

highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2010 include the following 

 

  

 

  

the following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results followed by a discussion of our segment operating results 

 

net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010 totaled 203 billion a 7 increase over net sales of 190 billion in fiscal 2009 the increase reflected a 6 increase from same store sales and a 4 increase from new stores offset by a 2 decline from the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and a 1 decrease from the 53 rd week in fiscal 2009 consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009 increased 4 over net sales of 183 billion for fiscal 2008 the increase reflected a 4 increase from new stores a 1 increase from the 53 rd week in fiscal 2009 and a 1 increase in same store sales offset by a 2 decline from the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

 

new stores have been a significant source of sales growth both our consolidated store count and our selling square footage increased by 3 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 both our consolidated store count and our selling square footage increased by 5 in fiscal 2009 over the prior fiscal year we expect to add 130 stores net of store closings in fiscal 2011 a 5 increase in both our consolidated store base and our selling square footage 

 

the 6 same store sales increase in fiscal 2010 was driven by significant increases in customer traffic at all of our businesses partially offset by a decline in the value of the average transaction the increase in customer traffic accelerated during the course of the year juniors dresses children’s apparel footwear accessories and home fashions performed particularly well in fiscal 2010 geographically same store sales increases in europe and canada trailed the consolidated average in the us sales were strong throughout the country with the midwest southeast and west coast above the average and new england and florida below the average 

 

the 1 same store sales increase in fiscal 2009 reflected a strong first half performance especially at our international segments partially offset by same store sales decreases in the second half of the year largely due to the economic recession customer traffic increased at virtually all of our businesses in fiscal 2009 even in the third and fourth quarters but was partially offset by a reduction in the value of the average transaction as for merchandise categories footwear accessories and dresses were the strongest performers while home fashions were adversely affected by the weak housing market and economic conditions geographically same store sales in canada and europe were above the consolidated average for fiscal 2009 while in the us same store sales in the west coast and florida trailed the consolidated average 

 

we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that have increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial same store sales of our foreign divisions are calculated on a constant currency basis meaning we translate the current year’s same store sales of our foreign divisions at the same exchange rates used in the prior year this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates which we believe is a more accurate measure of divisional operating performance 

 

 

the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales 

 

 

  

impact of foreign currency exchange rates our operating results can benefit or be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of significant changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies two of the more significant ways in which foreign currency impacts us are as follows 

 

translation of foreign operating results into us dollars in our financial statements we translate the operations of our stores in canada and europe from local currencies into us dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time significant changes in foreign exchange rates between comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales income from continuing operations and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of our canadian and european segments currency translation generally does not affect operating margins as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at essentially the same rates each period 

 

inventory hedges we routinely enter into inventoryrelated hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins when our international divisions purchase goods in currencies other than their local currencies primarily us dollar purchases as we have not elected “hedge accounting” as defined by us gaap we record a marktomarket gain or loss on the hedging instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period in subsequent periods the income statement impact of these adjustments is effectively offset when the inventory being hedged is sold while these effects occur every reporting period they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates during a short period of time the marktomarket adjustment on these hedges does not affect net sales but it does affect cost of sales operating margins and reported earnings 

 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 738 in fiscal 2010 759 in fiscal 2009 and 757 in fiscal 2008 the improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to improved consolidated merchandise margin which increased 21 percentage points along with expense leverage on the 6 same store sales increase particularly in occupancy costs which improved by 03 percentage points merchandise margin improvement was driven by our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need which resulted in an increase in markon along with a reduction in markdowns compared to the prior year these improvements were partially offset by a benefit to this expense ratio in fiscal 2009 due to the 53 rd week approximately 02 percentage points additionally for fiscal 2010 buying and occupancy expense leverage was offset by higher accruals for performancebased incentive compensation that covers many associates across our organization the higher accruals are the result of operating performance that was well ahead of our objectives 

 

this ratio for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 increased 02 percentage points primarily due to deleverage of buying and occupancy costs on the 1 same store sales increase this deleverage more than offset a benefit to this expense ratio due to the 53 rd week in fiscal 2009 approximately 02 percentage points as well as an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin of 02 percentage points throughout fiscal 2009 we effectively executed our offprice fundamentals buying close to need operating with leaner inventories and taking advantage of opportunities in the market place 

 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 164 in fiscal 2010 165 in fiscal 2009 and 163 in fiscal 2008 the improvement in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 was due to levering of expenses and savings from our expense reduction initiatives these 

 

improvements were partially offset by the increase in performancebased incentive compensation mentioned above which had an even greater impact on selling general and administrative expense ratio increasing it by 05 percentage points 

 

the fiscal 2009 expense ratio increased slightly compared to fiscal 2008 due to deleverage from the low same store sales increase primarily in store payroll and field costs partially offset by savings from cost containment initiatives advertising costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 were essentially flat compared to fiscal 2008 

 

provision for computer intrusion related costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 we established a reserve to reflect our estimate of our probable losses in accordance with us gaap with respect to the computer intrusion 

 

from the time of the discovery of the computer intrusion late in fiscal 2007 through the end of fiscal 2010 we cumulatively expensed 1715 million pretax with respect to the computer intrusion including a net charge of 1592 million in fiscal 2008 to reserve for probable losses costs of 428 million incurred prior to the establishment of the reserve 5 million of which was recorded in fiscal 2007 and a 305 million reduction in the reserve in fiscal 2009 as a result of negotiations settlements insurance proceeds and adjustments in our estimated losses costs relating to the computer intrusion incurred and paid after establishment of the reserve were charged against the reserve which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our balance sheet 

 

as of january 30 2010 our reserve balance was 235 million which reflects our current estimate of remaining probable losses with respect to the computer intrusion including litigation proceedings and other claims as well as legal monitoring reporting and other costs as an estimate our reserve is subject to uncertainty our actual costs may vary from our current estimate and such variations may be material we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserve as a result of developments in litigation and claims related expenses receipt of insurance proceeds and for other changes 

 

interest expense income net interest expense income net amounted to expense of 395 million for fiscal 2010 expense of 143 million for fiscal 2009 and income of 16 million for fiscal 2008 the components of net interest expense income for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

 

 

 

gross interest expense for fiscal 2010 increased over fiscal 2009 as a result of the incremental interest cost of the 375 million aggregate principal amount of 695 notes issued in april 2009 and the 400 million aggregate principal amount of 420 notes issued in july 2009 the 695 notes were issued in conjunction with the call for redemption of our zero coupon convertible securities and we refinanced our c235 million credit facility prior to its scheduled maturity with a portion of the proceeds of the 420 notes the impact on earnings per share of the incremental interest cost of these two debt issuances was partially offset by a benefit in our earnings per share as the majority of the 151 million shares issued upon conversion of the convertible notes were repurchased with the net proceeds of the 695 notes on a full year basis we expect the benefit of the share repurchase to more than offset the impact on fully diluted earnings per share from the interest on the 695 notes for more information on these note offerings see the discussion under liquidity and capital resources in addition interest income for fiscal 2010 was less than fiscal 2009 due to considerably lower rates of return on investments more than offsetting higher cash balances available for investment during fiscal 2010 

 

the change in net interest expense in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was driven by the change in interest income in fiscal 2008 we generated more interest income due to higher cash balances available for investment as well as higher interest rates earned on our investments 

 

 

income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was 378 in fiscal 2010 369 in fiscal 2009 and 379 in fiscal 2008 

 

the increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily attributed to the favorable impact in fiscal 2009 of a 19 million reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions arising from the settlement of several state tax audits the absence of this fiscal 2009 benefit increased the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2010 by 13 percentage points partially offset by a reduction in the effective income tax rate related to foreign income 

 

the decrease in the tax rate for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 reflected a 13 percentage point favorable impact of a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax position this benefit in the annual income tax rate in fiscal 2009 was offset by the absence of a fiscal 2008 favorable tax benefit of 04 percentage points relating to the tax treatment of our puerto rico subsidiary see note k to the consolidated financial statements 

 

tjx anticipates an effective annual income tax rate of 380 to 385 for fiscal 2011 

 

income from continuing operations and income per share from continuing operations income from continuing operations was 12 billion in fiscal 2010 a 33 increase over the 9149 million in fiscal 2009 which in turn was a 17 increase over the 7824 million in fiscal 2008 income from continuing operations per share was 284 in fiscal 2010 208 in fiscal 2009 and 168 in fiscal 2008 several items discussed below affected earnings per share comparisons for fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 

 

we estimate that the 53 rd week in fiscal 2009 favorably affected earnings per share in that year by 009 per share 

 

the reduction in the provision for computer intrusion related costs in fiscal 2009 benefited income from continuing operations in fiscal 2009 by approximately 004 per share the charge relating to the computer intrusion related costs in fiscal 2008 adversely affected income from continuing operations in that year by 025 per share 

 

foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results foreign currency rates reduced earnings per share by 001 per share in fiscal 2010 compared to a 001 per share benefit in fiscal 2009 when comparing fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2008 foreign currency exchange rates reduced earnings per share by 005 per share in fiscal 2009 compared to a 001 per share benefit in fiscal 2008 

 

in addition our weighted average diluted shares outstanding affect the comparability of earnings per share which are benefited by our share repurchase programs we repurchased 270 million shares of our stock at a cost of 950 million in fiscal 2010 240 million shares at a cost of 741 million in fiscal 2009 and 333 million shares at a cost of 950 million in fiscal 2008 we significantly reduced our weighted average diluted shares outstanding from 4423 million to 4276 million in fiscal 2010 with the incremental purchase over those planned under our stock repurchase program by using the proceeds of our april 2009 debt offering to repurchase the majority of the 151 million shares issued on conversion of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes following their call 

 

discontinued operations and net income fiscal 2009 and prior periods include the loss on the sale of the bob’s stores division in discontinued operations in addition the operating results for bob’s stores for all periods prior to the sale are included in discontinued operations including the impact of discontinued operations net income was 12 billion or 284 per share for fiscal 2010 8806 million or 200 per share for fiscal 2009 and 7718 million or 166 per share for fiscal 2008 

 

segment information the following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments in the united states our tj maxx and marshalls stores are aggregated as the marmaxx segment and each of homegoods and aj wright is reported as a separate segment tjx’s stores operated in canada winners and homesense are reported as the tjx canada segment and tjx’s stores operated in europe tk maxx and homesense are reported as the tjx europe segment we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income before general corporate expense provision for computer intrusion related costs and interest “segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities in addition this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from 

 

operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments 

 

us segments 

 

marmaxx 

 

 

 

net sales at marmaxx increased 7 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 same store sales for marmaxx were up 7 compared to being flat in fiscal 2009 

 

sales at marmaxx for fiscal 2010 reflected significantly increased customer traffic partially offset by a decrease in the value of the average transaction categories that posted particularly strong same store sales increases included juniors dresses children’s apparel and footwear home categories improved significantly at marmaxx during the year with same store sales increases above the chain average for fiscal 2010 geographically there were strong trends throughout the country same store sales were strongest in the midwest west coast and southeast while new england and florida trailed the chain average for fiscal 2010 we also saw a lift in the net sales of stores renovated during the year and we anticipate increasing our store renovation program in fiscal 2011 

 

segment profit as a percentage of net sales “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” increased to 120 in fiscal 2010 from 93 in fiscal 2009 this increase in segment margin for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to an increase in merchandise margin of 24 percentage points driven by lower markdowns and higher markon in addition the 7 increase in same store sales provided expense leverage on numerous costs as a percentage of net sales particularly occupancy costs which improved by 03 percentage points these increases were partially offset by an increase in administrative costs as a percentage of sales primarily due to higher accruals for performancebased incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives 

 

segment margin decreased to 93 in fiscal 2009 from 97 in fiscal 2008 segment margin was negatively impacted by an increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales 05 percentage points due to deleverage on the flat same store sales this decrease was partially offset by an increase in merchandise margin 01 percentage point due to increased markon 

 

as of january 30 2010 marmaxx’s average per store inventories including inventory on hand at its distribution centers were down 10 as compared to these inventory levels at the same time last year average per store inventories at january 31 2009 were down 4 compared to those of the prior year period as of january 30 2010 inventory commitments inventory on hand and merchandise on order were essentially flat on a per store basis compared to the end of fiscal 2009 

 

we expect to open approximately 53 new stores net of closings in fiscal 2011 increasing the marmaxx store base by 3 and increasing its selling square footage by 3 

 

 

homegoods 

 

 

 

homegoods’ net sales increased 14 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 same store sales increased 9 in fiscal 2010 driven by significantly increased customer traffic compared to a decrease of 3 in fiscal 2009 segment margin of 77 was up significantly from 27 for fiscal 2009 due to increased merchandise margins driven by increased markon and decreased markdowns levering of expenses on the 9 same store sales and operational efficiencies the merchandise margin improvements were driven by managing this business with much lower inventory levels which drove better offprice buying and increased inventory turns these improvements were partially offset by higher accruals for performancebased incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives 

 

homegoods’ net sales for fiscal 2009 increased 7 compared to fiscal 2008 and same store sales decreased 3 segment margin of 27 for fiscal 2009 was down from 51 for fiscal 2008 merchandise margins declined in fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased markdowns and operating costs delevered as a result of the decline in same store sales 

 

in fiscal 2011 we plan to add a net of 9 homegoods stores and increase selling square footage by 3 

 

aj wright 

 

 

 

aj wright’s net sales increased 15 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 and same store sales increased 9 aj wright’s improvement in sales was driven by an increasingly better understanding of its customers’ tastes and shopping habits which has led to improved merchandising and marketing segment profit increased significantly to 126 million in fiscal 2010 compared to segment profit of 29 million in fiscal 2009 the increase in segment margin in fiscal 2010 was primarily due to improved merchandise margin like our other divisions cost reduction initiatives and the benefit of expense leverage on the same store sales increase was partially offset by higher accruals for performancebased incentive compensation 

 

aj wright’s net sales increased 7 for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and segment profit increased to 29 million compared to a loss of 18 million in fiscal 2008 same store sales increased 4 for fiscal 2009 and aj wright recorded its first segment profit in fiscal 2009 compared to losses in the prior years 

 

in fiscal 2011 we plan to add a net of 8 aj wright stores and increase selling square footage by 6 

 

 

international segments 

 

tjx canada 

 

 

 

net sales for tjx canada which includes winners and homesense increased 1 in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 currency exchange translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by approximately 62 million or 3 as compared to fiscal 2009 same store sales were up 2 in fiscal 2010 compared to an increase of 3 in fiscal 2009 same store sales of juniors dresses mens and footwear as well as homesense on a standalone basis were above the segment average for fiscal 2010 

 

segment profit for fiscal 2010 increased to 255 million compared to 236 million in fiscal 2009 the impact of foreign currency translation decreased segment profit by 4 million or 2 in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 the marktomarket adjustment on inventory related hedges did not have a material impact on segment profit in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 segment margin increased 08 percentage points to 118 in fiscal 2010 compared to 110 in fiscal 2009 which was primarily due to an improvement in merchandise margins improvements in store payroll and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2010 due to operating efficiencies were offset by higher accruals for performancebased incentive compensation as a result of operating performance well ahead of objectives 

 

net sales for fiscal 2009 increased by 5 over fiscal 2008 currency exchange translation reduced fiscal 2009 sales by approximately 68 million same store sales increased 3 in fiscal 2009 compared to an increase of 5 in fiscal 2008 

 

segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased slightly to 236 million compared to 235 million in fiscal 2008 while segment margin decreased 05 percentage points to 110 currency exchange translation reduced segment profit by 11 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 however because currency translation impacts both sales and expenses it has little or no impact on segment margin in addition the marktomarket adjustment of inventory related hedges reduced segment profit in fiscal 2009 by 1 million in contrast to a 5 million benefit in fiscal 2008 which adversely impacted segment margin comparisons by 03 percentage points segment margin for fiscal 2009 reflected increases in distribution center costs and store payroll costs as a percentage of net sales partially offset by an increase in merchandise margins 

 

we expect to add a net of 6 stores in canada in fiscal 2011 and plan to increase selling square footage by 2 

 

 

tjx europe 

 

 

 

net sales for tjx europe increased in fiscal 2010 to 23 billion compared to 22 billion in fiscal 2009 currency exchange rate translation reduced fiscal 2010 sales by approximately 252 million or 11 as compared to fiscal 2009 same store sales increased 5 for fiscal 2010 compared to a 4 increase in fiscal 2009 segment profit for fiscal 2010 increased 19 to 164 million and segment profit margin increased 11 percentage points to 72 the increase in segment margin for fiscal 2010 reflects improved merchandise margins and leverage of expenses on the 5 same store sales increase partially offset by costs of operations in germany and poland along with higher accruals for performancebased incentive compensation we are encouraged by the performance of our stores in germany and poland and our homesense stores in the uk but as newer operations they reduce the segment margin generated by the more established tk maxx stores in the uk and ireland we also invested in strengthening the shared services infrastructure for our planned european expansion foreign currency had an immaterial impact on fiscal 2010 segment profit while segment profit for fiscal 2009 included a favorable marktomarket adjustment of 10 million primarily relating to the conversion of euros to pound sterling 

 

net sales for tjx europe for fiscal 2009 were up 1 compared to fiscal 2008 currency exchange rate translation negatively affected fiscal 2009 net sales by approximately 282 million segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased 8 to 1376 million and segment margin increased 04 percentage points to 61 compared to fiscal 2008 currency exchange rate translation negatively affected segment profit by approximately 26 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 the increase in segment margin in fiscal 2009 reflected improved merchandise margins partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of sales and the cost of operations in germany during fiscal 2009 tk maxx added 4 more stores in germany following the opening of its first 5 stores in germany in fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2009 tk maxx also introduced the homesense concept into the uk with 7 new stores 

 

as a result of the performance of tjx europe and the opportunity for offprice retail in europe we intend to increase the rate of expansion in europe in fiscal 2011 we plan to open a net of 48 new tk maxx stores in europe and a net of 6 homesense stores in the uk for a net total of 54 new stores in europe we also plan to expand total tjx europe selling square footage by 16 

 

general corporate expense 

 

 

 

general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes represents those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling general and administrative expenses the increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 is primarily due to an 18 million contribution to the 

 

tjx foundation in fiscal 2010 compared to no contribution in fiscal 2009 additionally fiscal 2010 had higher performancebased incentive and benefit plan accruals as compared to fiscal 2009 which were partially offset by benefits related to hedging activity 

 

general corporate expense in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 was virtually flat 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 2272 million in fiscal 2010 1155 million in fiscal 2009 and 1375 million in fiscal 2008 the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings the decrease in fiscal 2009 reflected the effects of the economic recession 

 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2010 increased 1117 million compared to fiscal 2009 net income provided cash of 1214 million in fiscal 2010 an increase of 333 million over net income of 881 million in fiscal 2009 the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable provided a source of cash of 345 million in fiscal 2010 compared to a 210 million use of cash in fiscal 2009 the reduction in inventory in fiscal 2010 was the result of the ongoing implementation of our strategy of operating with leaner inventories and buying closer to need which in turn increased inventory turnover changes in current income taxes payablerecoverable increased cash in fiscal 2010 by 191 million compared to a decrease in cash of 49 million in fiscal 2009 the change in prepaid expenses and other current assets had a favorable impact on fiscal 2010 cash flows of 64 million primarily due to the timing of february rental payments the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities provided cash of 31 million in fiscal 2010 compared to a 35 million use of cash in fiscal 2009 reflecting higher accruals in fiscal 2010 for performancebased incentive compensation partially offset by increased funding of the pension plan partially offsetting these favorable changes to fiscal 2010 operating cash flows was the change in the deferred income tax provision which reduced cash flows by 79 million compared to fiscal 2009 and the unfavorable impact of 61 million of all other items which primarily reflects unrealized gains on assets of the executive savings plan in fiscal 2010 versus unrealized losses in fiscal 2009 

 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2009 decreased by 220 million as compared to fiscal 2008 net income and the noncash impact of depreciation and the sale of bob’s stores assets of 31 million in fiscal 2009 including the benefit of the 53 rd week provided cash of 1314 million an increase of 173 million from the adjusted 1141 million in fiscal 2008 the change in deferred income taxes favorably impacted cash flows in fiscal 2009 by 132 million while last year’s deferred income taxes reduced cash flows by 102 million deferred taxes in fiscal 2008 reflected the noncash tax benefit of 47 million relating to the establishment of the computer intrusion reserve the favorable impact on deferred income taxes in fiscal 2009 reflected the tax treatment of payments against the computer intrusion reserve and favorable impact of tax depreciation the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable offset the favorable changes in cash flows in fiscal 2009 as it resulted in a use of cash of 210 million in fiscal 2009 compared to a source of cash of 5 million in fiscal 2008 the change in merchandise inventories and accounts payable in fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by a timing difference in the payment of our accounts payable due to a change in our buying pattern the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities resulted in a use of cash of 35 million in fiscal 2009 versus a source of cash of 203 million in fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2008 the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities reflected 117 million for the pretax reserve established for the computer intrusion which favorably impacted cash flows while fiscal 2009’s cash flows were reduced by 75 million for payments against and adjustments to this reserve changes in current income taxes payablerecoverable reduced cash in fiscal 2009 by 49 million compared to an increase of 56 million in fiscal 2008 and the change in prepaid expenses reduced fiscal 2009 operating cash flows by an additional 65 million primarily due to the timing of february rental payments 

 

 

discontinued operations reserve we have a reserve for future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases associated with the closure of 34 aj wright stores in fiscal 2007 as well as certain leases of former tjx businesses the balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below 

 

 

 

the charges against the reserve in fiscal 2010 fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 related primarily to the closed aj wright stores in fiscal 2009 we reserved an additional 3 million for exposure to properties related to the sale of bob’s stores which was offset by a comparable amount due to favorable settlements on several aj wright locations the majority of the reserve relates to lease obligations with respect to the closure of the aj wright stores and the sale of bob’s stores the remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost of claims updated quarterly that have been or we believe are likely to be made against us for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses after mitigation of the number and cost of these lease obligations the actual net cost of the various lease obligations included in the reserve may differ from our initial estimate although our actual costs with respect to the lease obligations may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve and we may incur costs for other leases from former discontinued operations we do not expect to incur any material costs related to these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts estimated we estimate that the majority of the discontinued operations reserve will be paid in the next three to five years the actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how the remaining lease obligations are actually settled 

 

we may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of bj’s wholesale club and 7 additional bob’s stores leases both former tjx businesses our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases because we currently believe that the likelihood of any future liability to us is not probable 

 

offbalance sheet liabilities we have contingent obligations on leases for which we were a lessee or guarantor which were assigned to third parties without tjx being released by the landlords over many years we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties with the exception of leases of our former businesses for which we have reserved we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases and accordingly we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them which could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants do not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases 

 

we also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate we estimate the undiscounted obligations not reflected in our reserves of leases of closed stores of continuing operations bj’s wholesale club and bob’s stores leases discussed above and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations to be approximately 94 million as of january 30 2010 we believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to us and to the extent they do will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors 

 

we are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold specified environmental matters or certain income taxes these obligations are typically limited in time and amount there are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations 

 

investing activities 

 

our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years as set forth in the table below 

 

 

 

we expect that capital expenditures will approximate 750 million for fiscal 2011 which we expect to fund through internally generated funds this includes 216 million for new stores 289 million for store renovations expansions and improvements and 245 million for our office and distribution centers the planned increase in capital expenditures is attributable to investment in systems distribution and other infrastructure to support growth as well as an increase in planned store openings and increased spending on renovations and improvements to existing stores 

 

investing activities for fiscal 2010 include the purchase and sale of some shortterm investments by tjx canada as excess cash was invested in funds with initial maturities greater than three months to enhance investment returns investing activities for fiscal 2009 and 2008 also include cash flows associated with our net investment hedges during fiscal 2009 we suspended our policy of hedging the net investment in our foreign subsidiaries and settled such hedges during the fourth quarter the net cash received on net investment hedges during fiscal 2009 amounted to 144 million versus net cash payments of 137 million in fiscal 2008 

 

financing activities 

 

cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 584 million in fiscal 2010 769 million in fiscal 2009 and 953 million in fiscal 2008 the majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase programs 

 

cash flows from financing activities for fiscal 2010 include the net proceeds of 774 million from two debt offerings on april 7 2009 we issued 375 million aggregate principal amount of 695 tenyear notes related to this transaction tjx called for the redemption of its zero coupon convertible subordinated notes virtually all of which were converted into 151 million shares of common stock we used the proceeds of the 695 notes to repurchase additional shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program on july 23 2009 we issued 400 million aggregate principal amount of 420 sixyear notes we used a portion of the proceeds of this offering to refinance our c235 million term credit facility on august 10 2009 prior to its scheduled maturity and used the remainder together with funds from operations to pay our 745 notes on their scheduled maturity of december 15 2009 

 

we spent 950 million in fiscal 2010 741 million in fiscal 2009 and 950 million in fiscal 2008 under our stock repurchase programs we repurchased 270 million shares in fiscal 2010 240 million shares in fiscal 2009 and 333 million shares in fiscal 2008 all shares repurchased were retired we record the repurchase of our stock on a cash basis and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our repurchases during fiscal 2010 we completed the 1 billion stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors in fiscal 2009 and initiated another multiyear repurchase program that had been approved by the board in september 2009 as of january 30 2010 795 million remained available for purchase under the program authorized in september 2009 in february 2010 the board authorized an additional 1 billion stock repurchase program we currently plan to repurchase up to approximately 900 million to 1 billion of our stock in fiscal 2011 we determine the timing and amount of repurchases and execution of rule 10b51 plans from time to time based on our assessment of various factors including excess cash flow liquidity market conditions the economic environment and prospects for the business and other factors and the timing and amount of these purchases may change 

 

we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 048 per share in fiscal 2010 044 per share in fiscal 2009 and 036 per share in fiscal 2008 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 

 

198 million in fiscal 2010 177 million in fiscal 2009 and 151 million in fiscal 2008 we announced our intention to increase the quarterly dividend on our common stock to 015 per share effective with the dividend payable in june 2010 subject to the approval of our board of directors financing activities also included proceeds of 170 million in fiscal 2010 142 million in fiscal 2009 and 134 million in fiscal 2008 from the exercise of employee stock options 

 

we traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of shortterm commercial paper we have a 500 million revolving credit facility maturing in may 2010 and a 500 million revolving credit facility maturing in may 2011 tjx pays six basis points annually on the committed amounts under each of these credit facilities these agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings these agreements serve as backup to our commercial paper program as of january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 there were no outstanding shortterm borrowings the maximum amount of our us shortterm borrowings outstanding was 165 million during fiscal 2010 and 222 million during fiscal 2009 the weighted average interest rate on our us shortterm borrowings was 101 in fiscal 2010 

 

as of january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 our foreign subsidiaries had uncommitted credit facilities tjx canada had two credit lines a c10 million credit facility for operating expenses and a c10 million letter of credit facility there were no borrowings under the canadian credit line for operating expenses in fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 there were no amounts outstanding on the canadian credit line for operating expenses at the end of fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 as of january 30 2010 and january 31 2009 tjx europe had a credit line of £20 million for our european operations the maximum amount outstanding under this uk credit line was £19 million in fiscal 2010 and £61 million in fiscal 2009 there were no outstanding borrowings on this uk credit line at the end of fiscal 2010 or fiscal 2009 

 

we believe that internally generated funds and our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating debt and capital needs for at least the next twelve months see note d to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our longterm debt and other financing sources 

 

contractual obligations as of january 30 2010 we had payment obligations including current installments under longterm debt arrangements leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows in thousands 

 

 

 

the longterm debt obligations above include estimated interest costs the lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance real estate taxes other operating expenses and in some cases rentals based on a percentage of sales these items totaled approximately onethird of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended january 30 2010 

 

our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise purchase orders for capital expenditures supplies and other operating needs commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services and commitments under executive employment and other agreements we exclude from purchase obligations longterm agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty 

 

we also have longterm liabilities which include 2545 million for employee compensation and benefits the majority of which will come due beyond five years 1510 million for accrued rent the cash flow requirements of which 

 

are included in the lease commitments in the above table and 1817 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible for us to predict when they may be paid 

 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap which require us to make certain estimates and judgments that impact our reported results these judgments and estimates are continually reviewed and based on historical experience and other factors which we believe are reasonable we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to the areas described below 

 

inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory on a firstin firstout basis under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory this method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage a significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in inventory valuation when the price of an item is reduced we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other inventory accounting methods in addition as a normal business practice we have a specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing the need for management estimates inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but is based on a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end thus the difference between actual and estimated amounts of shrinkage may cause fluctuations in quarterly results but is not a significant factor in full year results overall we believe that the retail method coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and the full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated lastly many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions which ultimately affect the value of inventory we have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors in our continuing operations 

 

impairment of longlived assets we review the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that the carrying amounts of those assets are not recoverable significant judgment is involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores as well as our business units which involve a number of factors including historical trends recent performance and general economic assumptions if we determine that an impairment of longlived assets has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of those assets over the estimated fair value of the assets we believe as of january 30 2010 that the carrying value of our longlived assets is appropriate 

 

retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates we are required to make assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the longterm rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period the discount rate which we determine annually based on market interest rates and our estimated longterm rate of return which can differ considerably from actual returns are two factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan the market performance on plan assets during fiscal 2009 was considerably worse than our expected return and as a result the unfunded status of our qualified plan increased significantly at the end of fiscal 2009 despite this we were not required to fund our plan during fiscal 2009 primarily due to voluntary funding in prior years in fiscal 2010 we funded our qualified pension plan with 1327 million and may make additional voluntary contributions during fiscal 2011 

 

sharebased compensation in accordance with us gaap tjx estimates the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under its stock incentive plan the fair value of the awards is amortized as “sharebased compensation expense” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service we use the blackscholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of stock options granted which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates the use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related expense 

 

 

casualty insurance in fiscal 2008 we initiated a fixed premium program for our casualty insurance previously our casualty insurance program required us to estimate the total claims we would incur as a component of our annual insurance cost the estimated claims are developed with the assistance of an actuary based on historical experience and other factors these estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates a large portion of these claims are funded with a nonrefundable payment during the policy year offsetting our estimated claims accrual we had a net accrual of 171 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of january 30 2010 

 

income taxes like many large corporations our income tax returns are regularly audited by federal state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign countries where we operate such authorities may challenge positions we take and we are engaged in various proceedings with such authorities with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds in accordance with us gaap we evaluate uncertain tax positions based on our understanding of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposure when we believe that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the positions will not be sustained upon examination however it is possible that amounts accrued or paid as the result of the final resolutions of examinations judicial or administrative proceedings changes in facts or law expirations of statute of limitations in specific jurisdictions or other resolutions of or changes in tax positions will differ either positively or negatively from the amounts we have accrued and may result in accruals or payments for periods not currently under examination or for which no claims have been made it is possible that such final resolutions or changes in accruals could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the period in which a examination or proceeding is resolved or in the period in which a changed outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 

 

reserves for computer intrusion related costs and for discontinued operations as discussed in note b and note n to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the management’s discussion and analysis we have reserves for probable losses arising out of the computer intrusion and for leases relating to operations discontinued by us where we were the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned or sublet to third parties the computer intrusion reserve requires us to make estimates and assumptions about the outcome and costs of claims litigation and investigations and costs and expenses we will incur we make these estimates based on our best judgments of the outcome of such claims litigation and investigations and of the amount of such costs and expenses the leases relating to discontinued operations are longterm obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to particular leases the extent to which assignees or subtenants will fulfill our financial and other obligations under the leases how particular obligations may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors including indemnification may exist to any liability we may have we develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location we believe that our reserves are a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcomes arising out of the computer intrusion and the leases relating to discontinued operations and that the reserves should be adequate to cover the ultimate cash costs we will incur however actual results may differ from our current estimates and such differences could be material we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for developments relating to the underlying assumptions and other factors 

 

loss contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our management where relevant with the assistance of our legal counsel assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessments inherently involve exercises of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated then we will accrue for the estimated liability in the financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is 

 

probable but cannot be reasonably estimated then we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 

we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our canadian and european operations on the translation of these foreign operations into the us dollar and on purchases by our operations of goods in currencies that are not their local currencies as more fully described in note e to our consolidated financial statements we hedge a portion of our intercompany transactions with foreign operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations with derivative financial instruments during fiscal 2009 we ceased hedging our net investment position in our foreign operations we enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency as of january 30 2010 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pretax income from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 by approximately 42 million 

 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our cash equivalents shortterm investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by us in addition changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest expense we periodically enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing however we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variablerate debt outstanding cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments as of january 30 2010 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

 

equity price risk 

 

the assets of our qualified pension plan a large portion of which are invested in equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the financial markets we allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to market uncertainties investments in general are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility risks the significant decline in the financial markets over the last several years has impacted the value of our pension plan assets and the funded status of our plan resulting in increased contributions to the plan

business overview 

 

the tjx companies inc tjx is the leading offprice apparel and home fashions retailer in the united states and worldwide our over 2600 stores offer a rapidly changing assortment of quality brandname and designer merchandise at prices generally 20 to 60 below department and specialty store regular prices every day

in europe 

 

  

  

flexible business model our offprice business model is flexible particularly for a company of our size allowing us to react to market trends our opportunistic buying and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to adjust the merchandise in our stores more frequently than traditional retailers and our stores and distribution centers are built to support this flexibility by maintaining a liquid inventory position our merchants can buy close to need enabling them to buy into current market trends and take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace buying close to need gives us the ability to turn our inventory more rapidly and adjust our pricing to the current market more frequently than conventional retailers our selling floor space is flexible without walls between departments and largely free of permanent fixtures so we can easily expand and contract departments in response to customer demand available merchandise and fashion trends our distribution facilities are designed to accommodate our methods of receiving and shipping both small and large quantities of product to our large store base quickly and efficiently 

 

opportunistic buying we are distinguished from traditional retailers by our opportunistic buying of brand name fashionable merchandise we purchase the majority of the inventory for our apparel chains and a significant portion of the inventory for our home fashion chains opportunistically our merchant organization numbers over 600 in contrast to traditional retailers which typically order goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor our merchants are in the marketplace virtually every week buying primarily for the current selling season and to a limited extent for a future selling season 

 

due to the unpredictable nature of supply and consumer demand in the highly fragmented apparel and home fashions marketplace we are able to buy the vast majority of our opportunistic inventory directly from manufacturers with some coming from other retailers and sources we source from a vendor universe of over 10000 vendors a year and purchase virtually all of our inventory at discounts from initial wholesale prices a small percentage of the merchandise we sell is private label merchandise produced specifically for us by third party manufacturers 

 

we believe a number of factors make us an attractive outlet for the vendor community and provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise we are willing to purchase lessthanfull assortments of items styles and sizes pay promptly and do not ask for typical retail concessions such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries or return privileges we are able to purchase quantities of inventory that range from small to very large and we have the ability to sell product through a geographically diverse network of stores importantly in tjx we offer vendors an outlet with financial strength and an excellent credit rating 

 

inventory management we offer our customers a rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a “treasure hunt” experience in our stores to achieve this we seek to rapidly turn the inventory in our stores regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions at excellent values our specialized inventory planning purchasing monitoring and markdown systems coupled with distribution center storage processing handling and shipping systems enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local preferences achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of products and sell substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment are determined centrally using information provided by specialized computer systems and are designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner we do not generally engage in promotional pricing activity 

 

low cost operations we operate with a low cost structure compared to many other traditional retailers we focus aggressively on expenses throughout our business including merchandise and nonmerchandise procurement our advertising budget as a percentage of sales is low compared to traditional retailers we design our stores generally located in community shopping centers to provide a pleasant convenient shopping environment but do not spend heavily on store fixtures additionally our distribution network is designed to run cost effectively 

 

customer service while we offer a selfservice format we train our store associates to provide friendly and helpful customer service we also have customerfriendly return policies we accept a variety of payment methods including cash credit cards and debit cards in the us we offer a cobranded tjx credit card and a private label credit card both through a major bank but do not maintain customer credit receivables related to either program 

 

distribution we operate 13 distribution centers in the us 2 in canada and 4 in the uk our distribution centers encompass approximately 11 million square feet we ship substantially all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers which are large highly automated and built to suit our specific offprice business model as well as warehouses operated by third parties we shipped approximately 15 billion units to our stores during fiscal 2009

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k the risks that follow individually or in the aggregate are those that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements 

 

the adverse changes in global economic conditions and in financial and credit markets have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial performance 

 

as widely reported economies worldwide are in crisis and global financial markets have been experiencing extreme volatility disruption and credit contraction the current volatility and disruption to the capital markets have reached unprecedented levels and have significantly adversely impacted global economic conditions and may continue to do so resulting in additional significant recessionary pressures and declines in employment levels disposable income and actual and perceived wealth adverse economic conditions continue to affect consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending and have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our sales cash flows and results of operations additionally adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets could adversely affect our costs of capital and the sources of liquidity available to us and have increased and could in the future increase our pension funding requirements finally the effects and consequences of the current global economic crisis may not yet be known which could potentially have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources or otherwise negatively affect our business and financial results 

 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may lead to lower revenues and earnings 

 

in addition to our us businesses we operate stores in canada the uk ireland and germany sales made by our stores outside the united states are denominated in the currency of the country in which the store is located and changes in foreign exchange rates affect the translation of the sales and earnings of these businesses into us dollars for financial reporting purposes because of this movements in exchange rates have had and are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our net sales and earnings 

 

additionally we routinely enter into inventoryrelated hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange on merchandise margins of merchandise purchased by our international segments that is denominated in currencies other than their local currencies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we evaluate the fair value of these hedging instruments and make marktomarket adjustments at the end of an accounting period these adjustments are of a much greater magnitude when there is significant volatility in currency exchange rates and may have a significant impact on our earnings 

 

in addition changes in foreign exchange rates can increase the cost of inventory purchases by one of our businesses that are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of that business when these changes occur suddenly it can be difficult for us to adjust retail prices accordingly and gross margin can be adversely affected we expect that such changes may materially affect the gross margins of our canada segment 

 

although we implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates we expect that foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our net sales and results of operations 

 

failure to execute our opportunistic buying and inventory management could adversely affect our business 

 

we purchase the majority of our inventory opportunistically with our buyers purchasing close to need to drive traffic to the stores and to increase same store sales the treasure hunt nature of the offprice buying experience requires continued replenishment of fresh high quality attractively priced merchandise in our stores while opportunistic buying enables our buyers to buy at opportune times and prices in the quantities we need and into market trends it places considerable discretion in our buyers subjecting us to risks on the timing pricing quantity and nature of inventory flowing to the stores in addition we base our purchases of inventory in part on sales forecasts if our sales forecasts do not match customer demand we may experience higher inventory levels and decreased profit margins if we have excess or slowmoving inventory or we may have insufficient inventory to meet customer demand either of which could adversely affect our financial performance in addition to acquiring inventory we must properly execute our inventory management strategies through effectively allocating merchandise among our stores timely and efficiently distributing inventory to stores maintaining an appropriate mix and level of inventory in stores appropriately changing the allocation of floor space of stores among product categories to respond to customer demand and effectively managing pricing and markdowns failure to execute our opportunistic inventory buying and inventory management well could adversely affect our performance and our relationship with our customers 

 

failure to continue to expand our operations successfully could adversely affect our financial results 

 

we have steadily expanded the number of concepts and stores we operate our revenue growth is dependent among other things upon our ability to continue to expand successfully through new store openings as well as our ability to increase same store sales successful store growth requires acquisition and development of appropriate real estate including selection of store locations in appropriate geographies availability of attractive stores or store sites in such locations and negotiation of acceptable terms competition for desirable sites increases in real estate construction and development costs and availability and costs of capital could limit our ability to open new stores in desirable locations in the future or adversely affect the economics of new stores when we open stores in new markets we may encounter difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of customer familiarity with our brand our lack of familiarity with local customer preferences and seasonal differences in the market new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores and may be adversely affected by the sales and profitability of existing stores in their market areas further expansion places significant demands on the administrative merchandising store operations distribution and other organizations in our businesses to manage rapid growth and we may not do so successfully 

 

failure to successfully identify customer trends and preferences to meet customer demand could negatively impact our performance 

 

because our success depends on our ability to meet customer demand we take various steps to keep up with consumer trends and preferences including contacts with vendors monitoring product category and fashion trends and comparison shopping and actively monitoring fashion trends our opportunistic buying model allows us to buy close to need and in response to consumer preferences and trends however identifying consumer trends and preferences and successfully meeting customer demand is challenging and these steps and our offprice buying may be insufficient to do so which could adversely affect our results 

 

our quarterly operating results can be subject to significant fluctuations and may fall short of either a prior quarter or investors’ expectations 

 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter at points in the past and they may continue to do so in the future our earnings may not continue to grow at rates similar to the growth rates achieved in recent years and may fall short of either a prior quarter or investors’ expectations if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline factors that could cause us not to meet analysts’ earnings expectations include some factors that are within our control such as the execution of our offprice buying selection pricing and mix of merchandise and inventory management including flow markon and markdowns and some factors that are not within our control including actions of competitors weather conditions economic conditions and consumer confidence and seasonality in addition if we do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplate pursuant to our stock repurchase program our earnings per share may be adversely affected most of our operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not vary directly with the amount of sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term as a result if sales in a particular quarter are below expectations for that quarter we may not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter and therefore such a sales shortfall would have a disproportionate effect on our net income for the quarter we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to project sales and align expenses if we do not correctly forecast sales or appropriately adjust to actual results our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 

our future performance is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand within our existing markets and to extend our offprice model in new product lines chains and geographic regions 

 

our strategy is to continue to expand within existing markets and to expand to new markets and geographies this growth strategy includes developing new ways to sell more or different merchandise within our existing stores continued expansion of our existing chains in our existing markets and countries expansion of these chains to new markets and countries and development and opening of new chains all of which entail significant risk our growth is dependent upon our ability to successfully extend our offprice retail apparel and home fashions concepts in these ways unsuccessful extension of our model could adversely affect future growth or financial performance 

 

failure to implement our marketing advertising and promotional programs successfully or if our competitors are more effective with their programs than we are may adversely affect our revenue 

 

we use marketing advertising and promotional programs to attract customers to our stores we use various media for these programs including print television database marketing and direct marketing some of our competitors may have substantially larger expenditures for their programs which may provide them with a competitive advantage there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to effectively execute our marketing advertising and promotional programs and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 

 

our actual losses arising from the computer intrusion could exceed our reserve for our estimated probable losses and our reputation and business could be materially harmed as a result of any future data breach 

 

we suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions such intrusion or intrusions collectively the “computer intrusion” into portions of our computer system that process and store information related to customer transactions which was discovered late in fiscal 2007 and in which we believe that customer data were stolen as a result we faced and continue to face litigation claims and investigations we have recorded a reserve that reflects our estimation of probable losses arising from the computer intrusion in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles while this reserve represents our best estimation of total potential cash liabilities from litigation proceedings investigations and other claims as well as legal and other costs and expenses arising from the computer intrusion there is no assurance that our actual losses will not be greater 

 

since discovering the computer intrusion we have taken steps designed to further strengthen the security of our computer system and protocols and have instituted an ongoing program with respect to data security nevertheless there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a future data compromise we rely on commercially available systems 

 

software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential customer information such as payment card and personal information further the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk are determined and controlled by the payment card industry not by us improper activities by third parties advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a further compromise or breach of our computer system any such further compromises or breaches could cause interruptions in our operations damage to our reputation and customers’ willingness to shop in our stores violation of applicable laws regulations orders and agreements and subject us to additional costs and liabilities which could be material 

 

our business is subject to seasonal influences and a decrease in sales or margins during the second half of the year could adversely affect our operating results 

 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we generally realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the year which includes the backtoschool and yearend holiday seasons any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we experience risks associated with our substantial size and scale 

 

we operate seven retail concepts in several countries some aspects of the businesses and operations of the concepts are conducted with relative autonomy the large size of our operations our multiple businesses and the autonomy afforded to the concepts increase the risk that systems and practices will not be implemented uniformly throughout our company and that information will not be appropriately shared across different concepts and countries 

 

unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate or our distribution centers are located could adversely affect our operating results 

 

adverse and unseasonable weather affects customers’ willingness to shop and their demand for the merchandise in our stores frequent or unusually heavy snow ice or rain storms severe cold or heat or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets could adversely affect our sales and increase markdowns in addition natural disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes floods and earthquakes could severely damage or destroy one or more of our stores or distribution facilities located in the affected areas or result in the suspension of business in the affected areas or in areas served by the affected distribution center thereby disrupting our business operations 

 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete with many other local regional national and international retailers that sell apparel home fashions and other merchandise that we sell whether in stores through catalogs or media or over the internet we compete on the basis of quality price value merchandise selection and freshness brand name recognition service reputation and store location other competitive factors that influence the demand for the merchandise we sell include our advertising marketing and promotional activities and the name recognition and reputation of our chains if we fail to compete effectively our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

failure to attract and retain quality sales distribution center and other associates in appropriate numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel could adversely affect our performance 

 

our performance depends on recruiting developing training and retaining quality sales distribution center and other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel many of our associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover the nature of the workforce in the retail industry subjects us to the risk of immigration law violations which risk has increased in recent years our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates minimum wage legislation changing demographics health and other insurance costs and governmental labor and employment requirements in the event of increasing wage rates if we fail to increase our wages competitively the quality of our workforce could decline causing our customer service to suffer while increasing our wages could cause our earnings to decrease in addition certain associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model 

 

we must do significant internal training and development for a substantial number of our associates the market for retail management is highly competitive and in common with other retailers we face challenges in securing sufficient management talent changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates and management personnel could adversely affect our performance 

 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions of new businesses or divest any of our current businesses our business will be subject to additional risks 

 

we have grown our business in part through mergers and acquisitions we may consider opportunities to acquire new businesses or to divest current businesses acquisition or divestiture activities may divert attention of management from operating the existing businesses we may do a lessthanoptimal job of evaluating target companies and their risks and benefits and integration of acquisitions can be difficult and timeconsuming acquisitions may not meet our expectations or may expose us to unexpected or greaterthanexpected liabilities divestiture also involves risks such as the risks of exposure on lease obligations obligations undertaken in the disposition and potential liabilities that may arise under law as a result of the disposition or the subsequent failure of the acquirer failure to execute on mergers or divestitures in a satisfactory manner could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition 

 

failure to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively could disrupt our business or reduce our sales or profitability 

 

the efficient operation of our business depends on our information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to successfully select and implement new technologies systems controls and adequate disaster recovery systems we must operate and implement these systems and technologies such that we protect the confidentiality of data of our company our associates our customers and other third parties the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm our profitability 

 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to support new capital expansion operations debt repayment stock repurchase program and dividends 

 

our business depends upon our operations to generate strong cash flows and upon the availability of financing sources to support our capital expansion requirements general operating activities stock repurchase program and dividends and to fund debt repayment our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of availability of financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms could adversely affect our financial performance or our earnings per share growth 

 

general economic and other factors adversely affect consumer spending which could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

 

interest rates recession inflation deflation consumer credit availability consumer debt levels energy costs tax rates and policy unemployment trends threats or possibilities of war terrorism or other global or national unrest actual or threatened epidemics political or financial instability and general economic political and other factors beyond our control have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending consumer spending in turn affects sales at retailers which could include tjx these factors could adversely affect our sales and performance if we do not successfully implement strategies to mitigate them 

 

issues with merchandise quality or safety could damage our reputation sales or financial results 

 

various governmental authorities regulate the quality and safety of the merchandise we sell in our stores regulations and standards in this area including those related to the recently enacted consumer product safety improvement act of 2008 in the united states may change from time to time our inability to comply on a timely basis with regulatory requirements could result in significant fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we sell in our stores regardless of our fault or customer concerns about such issues could cause damage to our reputation lost sales uninsured product liability claims or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs and regulatory civil or criminal fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

we are subject to import risks associated with importing merchandise from abroad 

 

many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a limited extent by us in many foreign countries as a result we are subject to the various risks of doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad such as 

 

  

political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise could affect the availability and the price of our inventory 

 

our expanding international operations expose us to risks inherent in foreign operations 

 

we have a significant retail presence in canada the united kingdom and ireland and have recently expanded into germany our goal is to continue to expand into other international markets in the future our foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by our us operations as well as risks inherent in foreign operations such as understanding the retail climate and trends local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets complying with foreign laws rules and regulations and foreign currency fluctuations which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

 

our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price of oil 

 

prices of oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers a continued rise in oil prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have an adverse effect on our performance 

 

changes in laws and regulations and outcomes of litigation and proceedings could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

 

we are subject to federal state provincial or local laws rules and regulations in the united states and abroad any of which may change from time to time in ways which could materially adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition we are from time to time involved in litigation and proceedings the outcomes of which if determined adversely to us could materially adversely affect our operations and our financial results and condition in addition us generally accepted accounting principles in accordance with which we prepare our financial statements may change from time to time and these changes could have material effects on our reported financial results and condition 

 

we own and lease for long periods significant amounts of real estate which subjects us to various financial risks 

 

we lease virtually all of our store locations generally for long terms and either own or lease for long periods our primary distribution centers and administrative offices accordingly we are subject to the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions by making specified payments we may not be able to terminate a particular lease if or when we would like to do so if an existing or future store is not profitable and we decide to close it we may be committed to perform obligations under the applicable lease including among other things paying rent and operating expenses for the balance of the lease term or exercising rights to terminate and the performance of any of these obligations may be expensive when we assign or sublease leased property we can remain liable on the lease obligations if the assignee or sublessee does not perform in 

 

addition when leases expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close stores 

 

our stock price may fluctuate based on market expectations 

 

the public trading of our stock is based in large part on market expectations that our business will continue to grow and that we will achieve certain levels of net income if the securities analysts that regularly follow our stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance the market price of our stock is likely to drop in addition if our quarterly financial performance does not meet the expectations of securities analysts our stock price would likely decline the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

the discussion that follows relates to our 53week fiscal year ended january 31 2009 fiscal 2009 and the fiscal years ended january 26 2008 fiscal 2008 and january 27 2007 fiscal 2007 each of which included 52 weeks 

 

our results reflect two discontinued operations bob’s stores sold in fiscal 2009 and 34 aj wright stores closed in fiscal 2007 as part of a repositioning of the chain see note c to the consolidated financial statements all references in the following discussion are to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated 

 

our results reflect the costs of the unauthorized intrusion or intrusions collectively the “computer intrusion” into portions of our computer system which was discovered in late fiscal 2007 and in which we believe customer data were stolen see “provision for computer intrusion related costs” below 

 

 

results of operations 

 

our fiscal 2009 performance was adversely affected in the second half of the year by two macroeconomic factors the worldwide recession which adversely affected consumer spending and retail sales at tjx and generally and the significant strengthening of the us dollar against the canadian dollar and the british pound which adversely affected the translation of the operating results of our canadian and european businesses with the flexibility of our offprice business model in fiscal 2009 we increased our inventory turns and maintained the value proposition of our merchandise by buying closer to need and operating with leanerthanusual inventories we also continued a focus on tight expense control during fiscal 2009 despite the challenging environment customer traffic in fiscal 2009 was up across virtually all of our divisions and merchandise margins remained strong highlights of our financial performance for fiscal 2009 include the following 

 

  

  

we have implemented steps to position ourselves for the fiscal year ending january 30 2010 fiscal 2010 in light of the ongoing worldwide recession including 

 

  

the following is a discussion of our consolidated operating results followed by a discussion of our segment operating results 

 

net sales consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009 totaled 190 billion a 4 increase over net sales of 183 billion in fiscal 2008 the increase reflected a 4 increase from new stores a 1 increase from the 53rd week and a 1 increase in same store sales offset by a 2 decline from the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates consolidated net sales for fiscal 2008 increased 7 over net sales of 171 billion for fiscal 2007 the increase reflected increases of 3 from new stores 2 from same store sales and a 2 favorable impact due to foreign currency exchange rates 

 

new stores have been a significant source of sales growth both our consolidated store count and our selling square footage increased by 5 in fiscal 2009 and by 4 in fiscal 2008 over the respective prior year periods as a result of economic conditions we have planned store openings more conservatively and expect to add 64 stores net of store closings in fiscal 2010 a 2 increase in our consolidated store base and an increase of 2 in our selling square footage 

 

the 1 same store sales increase in fiscal 2009 reflected a strong first half performance especially at our international segments partially offset by same store sales decreases in the second half of the year largely due to the economic recession customer traffic increased at virtually all of our businesses in fiscal 2009 even in the third and fourth quarters which was partially offset by a reduction in the value of the average transaction as for merchandise categories shoes accessories and dresses were the strongest performers while home fashions were adversely affected by the weak housing market and economic conditions geographically same store sales in canada and the united kingdom were above the consolidated average for fiscal 2009 while in the us same store sales in the west coast and florida trailed the consolidated average 

 

the 2 increase in same store sales for fiscal 2008 was driven by a strong performance at our international segments in the us sales of dresses footwear and accessories were strong partially offset by softer sales in the balance of the women’s apparel category at marmaxx our largest business home categories were also weak same store sales increases benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments in marshalls during fiscal 2008 we opened expanded footwear departments in approximately 240 additional marshalls stores same store sales for fiscal 2008 at our international segments were above the consolidated average within the u s the strongest regions were the west coast and the northeast while florida and the southeast trailed the us average overall transaction volume was slightly down in fiscal 2008 more than offset by an increase in the value of the average transaction 

 

we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store sales criteria we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is 

 

closed we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial same store sales of our foreign divisions are calculated on a constant currency basis which removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and we believe it is a more accurate measure of the divisional operating performance 

 

the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales 

 

 

  

impact of foreign currency exchange rates our operating results can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates as a result of significant changes in the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies two of the more significant ways in which foreign currency impacts us are as follows 

 

translation of foreign operating results into us dollars in our financial statements we translate the operations of our stores in canada and europe from local currencies into us dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time significant changes in foreign exchange rates from comparable prior periods can result in meaningful variations in consolidated net sales income from continuing operations and earnings per share growth as well as the net sales and operating results of our canadian and european segments currency translation generally does not affect operating margins as sales and expenses of the foreign operations are translated at essentially the same rates each period 

 

inventory hedges additionally we routinely enter into inventoryrelated hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on merchandise margins when our international divisions purchase goods in currencies that are not their local currencies primarily us dollar purchases as we have not elected “hedge accounting” as defined by sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” under generally accepted accounting principles we record a marktomarket adjustment on the hedging instruments in our results of operations at the end of each reporting period prior to the currency gain or loss being recorded on the items being hedged in subsequent periods the income statement impact of the hedges are effectively offset when the related inventory is sold while these effects occur every reporting period they are of much greater magnitude when there are sudden and significant changes in currency exchange rates as there were in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009 historically the impact on a fullyear basis has not been material since the marktomarket adjustment on these hedges has no impact on net sales it affects both our operating margins and earnings growth 

 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 758 in fiscal 2009 755 in fiscal 2008 and 758 in fiscal 2007 this ratio for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 increased 03 percentage points primarily due to deleverage of buying and occupancy costs on the 1 same store sales increase this deleverage more than offset a benefit to this expense ratio due to the 53rd week estimated at approximately 02 percentage points as well as an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin of 02 percentage points throughout fiscal 2009 we solidly executed our offprice fundamentals buying close to need operating with leaner inventories and taking advantage of opportunities in the market place 

 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 reflected an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin 04 percentage points due to improved markon and lower markdowns throughout fiscal 2008 we solidly executed our offprice fundamentals buying close to need and taking advantage of opportunities in the market place this merchandise margin improvement was 

 

partially offset by a slight increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales all other buying and occupancy costs remained relatively flat as compared to the same period in the prior year 

 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 167 in fiscal 2009 166 in fiscal 2008 and 167 in fiscal 2007 the increase in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 reflects deleverage from the low same store sales increase primarily in store payroll and field costs partially offset by savings from cost containment initiatives advertising costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2009 were essentially flat to the prior year 

 

the fiscal 2008 expense ratio was slightly down compared to the prior year with a planned increase in advertising costs 01 percentage point being offset by cost containment initiatives 

 

provision for computer intrusion related costs from the time of the discovery of the computer intrusion late in fiscal 2007 through the end of fiscal 2009 we cumulatively expensed 1715 million pretax with respect to the computer intrusion including a net charge of 1592 million in fiscal 2008 to reserve for probable losses costs of 428 million incurred prior to establishment of the reserve 5 million of which was recorded in fiscal 2007 and a 305 million reduction in the reserve in fiscal 2009 as a result of negotiations settlements insurance proceeds and adjustments in our estimated losses costs relating to the computer intrusion incurred and paid after establishment of the reserve were charged against the reserve which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on our balance sheet 

 

as of january 31 2009 our reserve balance was 422 million which reflects our current estimation of remaining probable losses in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles with respect to the computer intrusion including litigation proceedings investigations and other claims as well as legal monitoring reporting and other costs as an estimate our reserve is subject to uncertainty our actual costs may vary from our current estimate and such variations may be material we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserve to adjust for developments in the course and resolution of litigation claims and investigations and related expenses and receipt of insurance proceeds and for other changes 

 

interest income expense net interest income expense net amounted to expense of 143 million for fiscal 2009 income of 16 million for fiscal 2008 and expense of 156 million for fiscal 2007 the changes from year to year relate primarily to interest income which totaled 222 million in fiscal 2009 407 million in fiscal 2008 and 236 million in fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2008 we generated more interest income due to higher cash balances available for investment as well as higher interest rates earned on our investments 

 

income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was 369 in fiscal 2009 379 in fiscal 2008 and 377 in fiscal 2007 the decrease in the tax rate for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 reflects the favorable impact of a 19 million reduction in the fin 48 tax liability which reduced the annual effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 by 13 percentage points this improvement in the annual income tax rate in fiscal 2009 was offset by the absence of a fiscal 2008 favorable tax benefit of 04 percentage points relating to the tax treatment of our puerto rico subsidiary see note j to the consolidated financial statements 

 

the increase in the tax rate for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 reflects the absence of some fiscal 2007 onetime benefits as well as an increase due to certain fin 48 tax positions partially offset by the favorable impact of increased income at our foreign operations and increased foreign tax credits relating to the tax treatment of our puerto rico subsidiary 

 

income from continuing operations income from continuing operations was 9149 million in fiscal 2009 7824 million in fiscal 2008 and 7872 million in fiscal 2007 income from continuing operations per share was 208 in fiscal 2009 168 in fiscal 2008 and 165 in fiscal 2007 unlike many companies in the retail industry we did not have a 53 rd week in fiscal 2007 but did have a 53 rd week in fiscal 2009 we estimate the 53 rd week in fiscal 2009 favorably affected earnings per share by 009 per share 

 

the reduction in the provision for computer intrusion related costs in fiscal 2009 benefited income from continuing operations by approximately 18 million aftertax or 004 per share the charge relating to the computer intrusion related costs in fiscal 2008 adversely affected income from continuing operations by approximately 119 million after tax or 025 per share 

 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates also affected the comparability of our results changes in currency rates reduced earnings per share by 005 per share in fiscal 2009 as compared to an increase of 001 per share in fiscal 2008 changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased fiscal 2008 earnings per share by 005 per share in comparison to fiscal 2007 

 

in addition our share repurchase program affects the comparability of earnings per share we repurchased 240 million shares of our stock at a cost of 741 million in fiscal 2009 we repurchased 333 million shares at a cost of 950 million in fiscal 2008 and we repurchased 220 million shares at a cost of 557 million in fiscal 2007 

 

discontinued operations and net income all historical income statements have been adjusted to reflect the sale of bob’s stores in fiscal 2009 and the closure of 34 aj wright stores in fiscal 2007 as discontinued operations including the impact of discontinued operations net income was 8806 million or 200 per share for fiscal 2009 7718 million or 166 per share for fiscal 2008 and 7380 million or 155 per share for fiscal 2007 

 

segment information the following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments in the united states our tj maxx and marshalls stores are aggregated as the marmaxx segment and homegoods and aj wright each is reported as a separate segment tjx’s stores operated in canada winners and homesense are reported as the canadian segment and tjx’s stores operated in europe tk maxx and homesense are reported as the european segment we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income before general corporate expense provision for computer intrusion related costs and interest “segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities in addition this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments 

 

marmaxx 

 

 

 

net sales at marmaxx increased 3 in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 same store sales for marmaxx were flat in fiscal 2009 compared to a 1 same store sales increase in fiscal 2008 

 

sales at marmaxx for fiscal 2009 reflected increased customer traffic offset by a decrease in the value of the average transaction categories that posted same store sales increases included footwear and accessories children’s clothing and dresses during fiscal 2009 we added expanded footwear departments to approximately 220 marshalls stores which nearly completes the expansion of footwear departments at marshalls home categories at marmaxx reported same 

 

store sales decreases in fiscal 2009 geographically in fiscal 2009 same store sales in the northeast midwest and midatlantic regions were above the chain average while same store sales in the west coast florida and the southeast were below the chain average 

 

segment profit as a percentage of net sales “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” decreased to 93 in fiscal 2009 from 97 in fiscal 2008 segment margin was negatively impacted by an increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales 05 percentage points due to deleverage on the flat same store sales this decrease was partially offset by an increase in merchandise margin 01 percentage point due to increased markon as of january 31 2009 average per store inventories including inventory on hand at distribution centers were down 4 compared to a 2 decrease at the prior year end the decreases in average inventories were primarily due to continued focus on maintaining a liquid inventory position 

 

segment margin for fiscal 2008 increased to 97 compared to 94 in fiscal 2007 segment margin was favorably impacted by merchandise margins which increased 04 percentage points as a percentage of net sales due to lower markdowns and a higher markon as well as some expense leverage due to our cost containment measures these improvements in segment margin were partly offset by an increase in occupancy costs and a planned increase in advertising expense 

 

we expect to open approximately 17 new stores net of closings in fiscal 2010 increasing the marmaxx store base by 1 and increasing its selling square footage by 1 

 

canada 

 

 

 

net sales for the canadian segment for fiscal 2009 increased by 5 over fiscal 2008 currency exchange translation reduced fiscal 2009 sales by approximately 68 million same store sales increased 3 in fiscal 2009 compared to a strong increase of 5 in fiscal 2008 same store sales of outerwear footwear jewelry and accessories were above the segment average while homesense same store sales were below the segment average for fiscal 2009 

 

segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased slightly to 236 million compared to 235 million in fiscal 2008 while segment margin decreased 05 percentage points to 110 currency exchange translation reduced segment profit by 11 million for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 however because currency translation impacts both sales and expenses it has little or no impact on segment margin in addition the marktomarket adjustment of inventory related hedges reduced segment profit in fiscal 2009 by 1 million in contrast to a 5 million benefit of the marktomarket adjustment of inventory related hedges in fiscal 2008 which adversely impacted segment margin comparisons by 03 percentage points segment margin for fiscal 2009 reflected increases in distribution center costs and store payroll costs as a percentage of net sales partially offset by an increase in merchandise margins in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 winners opened 2 stylesense stores a new concept that offers family footwear and accessories we anticipate that merchandise margins in the canadian segment will also decline in fiscal 2010 as a result of foreign 

 

currency exchange due to the high volume of merchandise purchases by the canadian segment denominated in us dollars 

 

segment profit margin for fiscal 2008 increased 11 percentage points to 115 compared to 104 for fiscal 2007 this improvement in segment margin was primarily due to improved expense ratios leverage from the 5 same store sales increase as well as cost containment initiatives currency exchange rates increased segment profit by approximately 24 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 most of this increase was due to currency translation and as a result it had no impact on segment margin the increase in segment profit in fiscal 2008 also included the favorable impact of a marktomarket adjustment of inventory hedge contracts which increased segment margin by 03 percentage points the fiscal 2008 segment margin also reflected an increase in merchandise margin primarily due to increased markon as well as the favorable impact of cost containment initiatives and strong same store sales results on expense ratios 

 

we expect to add a net of 13 stores in canada in fiscal 2010 which is an increase of 5 and will increase selling square footage by 5 

 

europe 

 

 

 

european net sales for fiscal 2009 increased 1 to 22 billion compared to fiscal 2008 currency exchange rate translation negatively affected fiscal 2009 sales by approximately 282 million same store sales increased 4 for fiscal 2009 compared to a 6 increase last year same store sales for footwear and accessories and most other women’s apparel categories performed above the chain average while home fashions were below the chain average 

 

segment profit for fiscal 2009 increased 8 to 1376 million and segment margin increased 04 percentage points to 61 compared to last year currency exchange rate translation negatively affected segment profit by approximately 26 million in fiscal 2009 the increase in segment margin reflects improved merchandise margins partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of sales and the cost of operations in germany we are encouraged by the performance of our german stores but as they are new stores they reduce the segment margin generated by the more established stores in the uk and ireland during fiscal 2009 tk maxx added 4 more stores in germany following the opening of its first 5 stores in germany in fiscal 2008 tk maxx also introduced the homesense concept into the uk with 7 new stores 

 

segment profit for fiscal 2008 increased 16 to 1272 million while segment margin decreased slightly to 57 compared to fiscal 2007 currency exchange rate translation favorably impacted segment profit by approximately 10 million in fiscal 2008 but did not impact the segment profit margin the opening of 5 stores in germany reduced segment profit for fiscal 2008 by 11 million and reduced the fiscal 2008 segment margin by 06 percentage points offsetting the slightly improved merchandise margin in the remainder of the segment as well as the favorable impact of same store sales growth on expense ratios and the segment’s cost containment initiatives 

 

in fiscal 2010 we plan to open a net of 17 tk maxx stores including 10 in germany and 3 homesense stores in the uk and to expand selling square footage by 8 

 

homegoods 

 

 

 

homegoods’ net sales for fiscal 2009 increased 7 compared to fiscal 2008 and same store sales decreased 3 in fiscal 2009 sales of home fashions have been particularly impacted by the weak housing market and recession segment margin of 27 was down from 51 for fiscal 2008 merchandise margins declined in fiscal 2009 primarily due to increased markdowns in addition homegoods experienced deleverage on operating costs as a result of the decline in same store sales we are seeking to address the difficult home environment by operating with very lean inventories and focusing on merchandise categories that we believe will resonate with consumers in these difficult times 

 

homegoods’ net sales for fiscal 2008 increased 8 compared to fiscal 2007 and same store sales increased 3 in fiscal 2008 segment margin of 51 for fiscal 2008 improved over fiscal 2007 primarily due to improved merchandise margins and the leveraging of expenses particularly occupancy costs these segment margin improvements were offset in part by an increase in advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales 

 

in fiscal 2010 we plan to add a net of 4 homegoods stores and increase selling square footage by 1 

 

aj wright 

 

 

 

aj wright’s net sales increased 7 for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 and segment profit increased to 29 million compared to a loss of 18 million in fiscal 2008 same store sales increased 4 for fiscal 2009 and aj wright recorded its first segment profit in fiscal 2009 compared to losses in the prior years we believe aj wright has improved its results through better merchandising and advertising effectiveness as a result of our improved understanding of aj wright’s customer tastes and spending habits 

 

aj wright’s net sales increased 5 for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 aj wright’s same store sales increased 2 for fiscal 2008 and segment loss for fiscal 2008 was 18 million compared to 103 million for fiscal 2007 this improvement was primarily due to stronger merchandise margin a reduction in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales and the impact of cost containment initiatives 

 

as a result of aj wright’s improved results we plan to increase the rate of store openings for this chain for fiscal 2010 currently planning to add a net of 13 aj wright stores and increase selling square footage by 10 

 

general corporate expense 

 

 

 

general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes is those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments and is included in selling general and administrative expenses 

 

general corporate expense in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 was virtually flat 

 

the comparison of general corporate expense in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 reflected an increase in corporate support costs in fiscal 2008 and a 5 million charge in fiscal 2007 relating to the cost of a workforce reduction and other termination benefits at the corporate level 

 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 1155 million in fiscal 2009 1375 million in fiscal 2008 and 1213 million in fiscal 2007 the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings 

 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2009 decreased by 220 million as compared to the prior year net income after adjusting for the noncash impact of depreciation and the sale of bob’s stores assets of 31 million in fiscal 2009 including the benefit of the 53rd week provided cash of 1314 million an increase of 173 million from the adjusted 1141 million in fiscal 2008 the change in deferred income taxes favorably impacted cash flows in fiscal 2009 by 132 million while last year’s deferred income taxes reduced cash flows by 102 million deferred taxes in fiscal 2008 reflected the noncash tax benefit of 47 million relating to the establishment of the computer intrusion reserve the favorable impact on deferred income taxes in fiscal 2009 reflected the tax treatment of payments against the computer intrusion reserve and favorable impact of tax depreciation the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable offset the favorable changes in cash flows in fiscal 2009 as it resulted in a use of cash of 210 million in fiscal 2009 compared to a source of cash of 5 million last year the change in merchandise inventories and accounts payable in fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by a timing difference in the payment of our accounts payable due to change in our buying pattern the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities resulted in a use of cash of 35 million in fiscal 2009 versus a source of cash of 203 million in fiscal 2008 last year the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities reflected 117 million for the pretax reserve established for the computer intrusion which favorably impacted cash flows while fiscal 2009’s cash flows were reduced by 75 million for payments against and adjustments to the reserve changes in current income taxes payablerecoverable reduced cash in fiscal 2009 by 49 million compared to an increase of 56 million in fiscal 2008 and the change in prepaid expenses reduced fiscal 2009 operating cash flows by an additional 65 million primarily due to the timing of february rental payments 

 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2008 increased by 162 million over the prior year net income after adjusting for the noncash impact of depreciation for fiscal 2008 increased 50 million the change in inventory net of accounts payable from prior yearend levels was a significant component of operating cash flows in fiscal 2008 the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable favorably impacted operating cash flows by 5 million compared to a use of cash of 151 million in fiscal 2007 additionally fiscal 2008 operating cash flows were favorably impacted by the change in income taxes payable these increases in fiscal 2008 operating cash flows as compared to fiscal 2007 were offset by the unfavorable cash flow impact of the deferred income tax provision changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities and changes in accounts receivable 

 

discontinued operations reserve we have a reserve for future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases associated with the closure of 34 aj wright stores as well as leases of former tjx businesses in fiscal 2009 we reserved an additional 3 million for 2 bob’s stores locations which the buyer of bob’s 

 

stores has the right to put back to us and which we consider probable this was offset by a comparable amount due to favorable settlements on several aj wright locations the balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below 

 

 

 

we added 62 million in fiscal 2007 for the exit costs related to the closing of 34 aj wright stores see note c to our consolidated financial statements the additions to the reserve for other lease related obligations in fiscal 2007 were the result of periodic adjustments to the estimated lease obligations of our former businesses and were offset by income from creditor recoveries of a similar amount the lease related charges against the reserve during fiscal 2007 related primarily to our former businesses the fixed asset writeoffs and other charges against the reserve for fiscal 2007 and all of the charges against the reserve in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009 related primarily to the 34 aj wright closed stores 

 

approximately 25 million of the fiscal 2009 reserve balance relates to the aj wright store closings primarily our estimation of lease costs net of estimated subtenant income approximately 3 million of the reserve at fiscal 2009 relates to 2 bob’s stores locations which are considered probable for being put back to tjx by the buyer the remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost of claims updated quarterly that have been or we believe are likely to be made against us for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses after mitigation of the number and cost of these lease obligations at january 31 2009 substantially all the leases of former businesses that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against us had been resolved the actual net cost of these lease obligations may differ from our original estimate although our actual costs with respect to the lease obligations of former businesses may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve and we may incur costs for leases from these former businesses that were not terminated or had not expired we do not expect to incur any material costs related to these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts estimated we estimate that the majority of the discontinued operations reserve will be paid in the next three to five years the actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how the remaining lease obligations are actually settled 

 

we may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of bj’s wholesale club a former tjx business and 8 additional bob’s stores leases our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases because we do not believe that the likelihood of any future liability to us is probable 

 

offbalance sheet liabilities we have contingent obligations on leases for which we were a lessee or guarantor which were assigned to third parties without tjx being released by the landlords over many years we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties with the exception of leases of our former businesses discussed above we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases and accordingly we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them which could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants does not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases 

 

we also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate we estimate the undiscounted obligations not reflected in our reserves of leases of closed stores of continuing operations bj’s wholesale club and bob’s stores leases discussed above and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations to be approximately 100 million as of january 31 2009 we believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to us and to the extent they do will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors 

 

we are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify other parties with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold specified environmental matters or certain income taxes these obligations are typically limited in time and amount there are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations 

 

investing activities 

 

our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three years as set forth in the table below 

 

 

 

we expect that capital expenditures will approximate 450 million for fiscal 2010 which we expect to fund through internally generated funds this includes 153 million for new stores 182 million for store renovations expansions and improvements and 115 million for our office and distribution centers the planned decrease in capital expenditures is attributable to fewer planned store openings and reduced spending on renovations and improvements to existing stores 

 

investing activities also include cash flows associated with our net investment hedges during fiscal 2009 we suspended our policy of hedging the net investment in our foreign subsidiaries and settled such hedges during the fourth quarter the net cash received on net investment hedges during fiscal 2009 amounted to 144 million versus net cash payments of 137 million in fiscal 2008 and 177 million in fiscal 2007 

 

financing activities 

 

cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 769 million in fiscal 2009 953 million in fiscal 2008 and 418 million in fiscal 2007 the majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program 

 

we spent 741 million in fiscal 2009 950 million in fiscal 2008 and 557 million in fiscal 2007 under our stock repurchase programs we repurchased 240 million shares in fiscal 2009 333 million shares in fiscal 2008 and 220 million shares in fiscal 2007 all shares repurchased were retired we record the repurchase of our stock on a cash basis and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our repurchases our fiscal 2009 repurchases completed the 1 billion stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors in january 2007 and included the repurchase of 89 million shares at a cost of 255 million under the 1 billion stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors in february 2008 as of january 31 2009 745 million remained available for purchase under the current program the timing of purchases under this program is determined by tjx from time to time based on its assessment of various factors including excess cash flow liquidity and market conditions we are taking a more conservative approach to our stock repurchase program and currently plan to repurchase up to approximately 250 million of our stock in fiscal 2010 this timing and amount of these purchases are subject to change depending upon the economic environment and other factors 

 

the 4649 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes which are due in february 2021 are convertible into 152 million shares of common stock under certain conditions 

 

including if the closing sale price of our common stock reaches specified trigger prices the trigger price was met during a portion of fiscal 2009 and 52552 notes were converted during fiscal 2009 resulting in the issuance of 17 million shares of common stock the notes were not convertible during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 because our stock price did not meet the trigger prices during relevant periods the trigger prices will have to be met during applicable future periods for the notes to be convertible in future quarters 

 

we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 044 per share in fiscal 2009 036 per share in fiscal 2008 and 028 per share in fiscal 2007 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 177 million in fiscal 2009 151 million in fiscal 2008 and 123 million in fiscal 2007 financing activities also included proceeds of 142 million in fiscal 2009 134 million in fiscal 2008 and 260 million in fiscal 2007 from the exercise of employee stock options 

 

we traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of shortterm commercial paper we have a 500 million revolving credit facility maturing in may 2010 and a 500 million revolving credit facility maturing in may 2011 these agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings these agreements serve as backup to our commercial paper program as of january 31 2009 there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities the maximum amount of our us shortterm borrowings outstanding was 222 million during fiscal 2009 the weighted average interest rate on our us shortterm borrowings was 392 in fiscal 2009 there were no borrowings on our credit facilities during fiscal 2008 

 

as of january 31 2009 and january 26 2008 winners had two credit lines one for c10 million for operating expenses and one c10 million letter of credit facility winners did not borrow under the credit line for operating expenses in fiscal 2009 the maximum amount outstanding under our canadian credit line for operating expenses was c57 million in fiscal 2008 and c38 million in fiscal 2007 there were no amounts outstanding on this line at the end of fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008 as of january 31 2009 tk maxx had a credit line of £20 million the maximum amount outstanding was £61 million in fiscal 2009 and £164 million in fiscal 2008 there were no outstanding borrowings on this credit line at the end of fiscal 2009 or fiscal 2008 

 

we believe that internally generated funds and our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating debt and capital needs for at least the next twelve months see note d to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our longterm debt and other financing sources 

 

contractual obligations as of january 31 2009 we had payment obligations including current installments under longterm debt arrangements leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows in thousands 

 

 

 

the longterm debt obligations above include estimated interest costs and assume that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal 2014 if none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted the notes will mature in fiscal 2022 the effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based on their values as of january 31 2009 

 

the lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance real estate taxes other operating expenses and in some cases rentals based on a percentage of sales which together were approximately onethird of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended january 31 2009 

 

our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise purchase orders for capital expenditures supplies and other operating needs commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services and commitments under executive employment and other agreements we excluded longterm agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty 

 

we also have longterm liabilities which include 2729 million for employee compensation and benefits the majority of which will come due beyond five years 1379 million for accrued rent the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table and 2406 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible to predict when it may be paid 

 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

we must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to the areas described below we believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained had alternative assumptions been selected would not be materially different from the results we have reported 

 

inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory on a firstin firstout basis under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory this method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage a significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods in addition as a normal business practice we have a specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing the need for management estimates inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but is based on a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end thus the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results but is not a significant factor in full year results overall we believe that the retail method coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated lastly many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions which ultimately affect the value of the inventory our offprice businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors 

 

impairment of longlived assets we review the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that their carrying amounts are not recoverable significant judgments are involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores and our business units and involve a number of factors including historical trends recent performance and general economic assumptions if it is determined that an impairment of longlived assets has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the estimated fair value of the assets 

 

retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates we are required to make assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the longterm rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period the discount rate which we determine annually based on market interest rates and our estimated longterm rate of return which can differ considerably from actual returns are two factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan the market performance on plan assets during fiscal 2009 was considerably worse than our expected return and as a result the 

 

unfunded status of our qualified plan increased significantly despite this we were not required to fund our plan during fiscal 2009 primarily due to voluntary funding in prior years as of the date of this report we have funded 50 million into the qualified pension plan and may make additional voluntary contributions during fiscal 2010 

 

share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” “sfas no 123r” tjx estimates the fair value of stock awards issued to employees and directors under its stock incentive plan the fair value of the awards is amortized as “stock compensation cost” over the vesting periods during which the recipients are required to provide service we use the black scholes method for determining the fair value of stock options granted which requires management to make significant judgments and estimates the use of different assumptions and estimates could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of stock option grants and the related expense 

 

casualty insurance in july 2007 we entered into a fixed premium program for our casualty insurance our casualty insurance program prior to 2007 required us to estimate the total claims we will incur as a component of our annual insurance cost the estimated claims are developed with the assistance of an actuary based on historical experience and other factors these estimates involve significant judgments and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates if our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance expense for fiscal 2009 were to change by 10 the fiscal 2009 pretax cost would increase or decrease by approximately 2 million a large portion of these claims are funded with a nonrefundable payment during the policy year offsetting our estimated claims accrual we had a net accrual of 208 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of january 31 2009 

 

income taxes like many large corporations our income tax returns are regularly audited by federal state and local tax authorities in the united states and in foreign countries where we operate such authorities may challenge positions we take and we are engaged in various proceedings with such authorities with respect to assessments claims deficiencies and refunds in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we evaluate uncertain tax positions based on our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date and we accrue for exposures when we believe that it is more likely than not based on the technical merits that the positions will not be sustained upon examination however it is possible that the actual results of proceedings with tax authorities and in courts changes in facts expiration of statutes of limitations or other resolutions of tax positions will differ from the amounts we have accrued in either a positive or a negative manner which could materially affect our effective income tax rate in a given financial period the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our results of operations 

 

reserves for computer intrusion related costs and for discontinued operations as discussed in note b and note m to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the management’s discussion and analysis we have reserves established for probable losses arising out of the computer intrusion and for leases relating to operations discontinued by us where we were the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned or sublet to third parties the computer intrusion reserve requires us to make estimates and assumptions about the outcome and costs of claims litigation and investigations and costs and expenses we will incur we make these estimates based on our best judgments of the outcome of such claims litigation and investigation and the amount of such costs and expenses the leases relating to discontinued operations are longterm obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to a particular lease the extent to which an assignee or subtenant will assume our obligations under the leases amounts of subtenant income how a particular obligation may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors including indemnification may exist to any liability we develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location we believe that our current reserves are a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcomes and that the reserves should be adequate to cover the ultimate cash costs we will incur however actual results may differ from our current estimates and such differences could be material we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for developments relating to the underlying assumptions 

 

loss contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to us but which will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our management where relevant with the assistance of our legal counsel assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not estimable

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 

we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

 

 

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our canadian winners and homesense and european tk maxx and homesense operations and on the translation of these foreign operations into the u s dollar as more fully described in notes a and e to the consolidated financial statements to the annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended january 31 2009 we hedge a significant portion of our intercompany transactions with foreign operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations with derivative financial instruments during fiscal 2009 we ceased hedging our net investment position in our foreign operations we enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as well as the translation of our foreign operations into our reporting currency as of january 31 2009 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position but could have reduced our pretax income from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 by approximately 37 million 

 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our cash equivalents and shortterm investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by us in addition changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest expense we occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing however we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding as of january 31 2009 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

 

equity price risk 

 

the assets of our qualified pension plan a large portion of which is invested in equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market we allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties investments in general are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility as a result of the significant decline in the capital markets in 2009 the value of our pension plan assets decreased substantially increasing the unfunded status of our plan and reducing shareholder’s equity on our balance sheet

business overview 

 

we are the leading offprice retailer of apparel and home fashions in the united states and worldwide our tj maxx marshalls and aj wright chains in the united states our winners chain in canada and our tk maxx chain in europe sell offprice family apparel and home fashions our homegoods chain in the united states and our homesense chain operated by winners in canada sell offprice home fashions the target customer for all of our offprice chains except aj wright is the middleto uppermiddle income shopper with the same profile as a department or specialty store customer aj wright targets the moderateincome customer our seven offprice chains are synergistic in their philosophies and operating platforms our eighth chain bob’s stores was acquired in december 2003 and is a valueoriented branded apparel chain based in the northeastern united states that offers casual family apparel bob’s stores’ target customer demographic spans the moderateto uppermiddle income bracket 

 

our offprice mission is to deliver an exciting fresh and rapidly changing assortment of brandname merchandise at excellent values to our customers we define value as the combination of quality brand fashion and price with over 500 buyers 10000 vendors worldwide and over 2500 stores we believe we are well positioned to continue accomplishing this goal our key strengths include 

 

  

as an offprice retailer we offer quality name brand and designer family apparel and home fashions every day at substantial savings to comparable department and specialty store regular prices we can offer these everyday savings as a result of our opportunistic buying strategies disciplined inventory management including rapid inventory turns and low expense structure 

 

in our offprice apparel chains we purchase the majority of our inventory opportunistically opportunistic purchases are also a significant factor in our home fashion businesses but to a lesser extent in contrast to traditional retailers that order goods far in advance of the time they appear on the selling floor tjx buyers are in the marketplace virtually every week buying primarily for the current selling season by maintaining a liquid inventory position our buyers can buy close to need enabling them to buy into current market trends and take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace due to the unpredictable nature of consumer demand in the highly fragmented apparel and home fashions marketplace and the mismatch of supply and demand we are regularly able to buy the vast majority of our inventory directly from manufacturers with some merchandise coming from other retailers and other sources we purchase virtually all of our inventory for our offprice stores at discounts from initial wholesale prices although we generally purchase merchandise for our offprice chains to sell in the current season we purchase a limited quantity of pack away merchandise that we buy specifically to warehouse and sell in a future selling season we are willing to purchase less than a full assortment of styles and sizes we pay promptly and do not ask for typical retail concessions in our offprice chains such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances or delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries or return privileges our financial strength strong reputation and ability to purchase large quantities of merchandise and sell it through our geographically diverse network of stores provide us excellent access to leading branded merchandise our opportunistic buying permits us to consistently offer our customers in our offprice chains a rapidly changing merchandise assortment at everyday values that are below department and specialty store regular prices 

 

we are extremely disciplined in our inventory management and we rapidly turn the inventory in our offprice chains we rely heavily on sophisticated internally developed inventory systems and controls that permit a virtually continuous flow of merchandise into our stores and an expansive distribution infrastructure that supports our closetoneed buying by delivering goods to our stores quickly and efficiently for example highly automated storage and distribution systems 

track allocate and deliver an average of approximately 11000 items per week to each tj maxx and marshalls store in addition specialized computer inventory planning purchasing and monitoring systems coupled with warehouse storage processing handling and shipping systems permit a continuous evaluation and rapid replenishment of store inventory pricing markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment requirements are determined centrally using information provided by pointofsale computer terminals and are designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner these inventory management and distribution systems allow us to achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of product and sell substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods 

 

we operate with a low cost structure relative to many other retailers our stores are generally located in community shopping centers while we seek to provide a pleasant easy shopping environment with an emphasis on customer convenience we do not spend heavily on store fixtures our selling floor space is flexible without walls between departments and largely free of permanent fixtures so we can easily expand and contract departments in response to customer demand available merchandise and fashion trends also our large retail presence strong financial position and expertise in the real estate market allow us generally to obtain favorable lease terms in our offprice chains our advertising budget as a percentage of sales remains low compared to traditional department and specialty stores our high salespersquarefoot productivity and rapid inventory turnover also provide expense efficiencies 

 

with all of our offprice chains operating with the same offprice strategies and systems we are able to capitalize upon expertise best practices initiatives and new ideas across our chains develop associates by transferring them from one chain to another and grow our various businesses more efficiently and effectively 

 

during the fiscal year ended january 26 2008 we derived 77 of our sales from the united states including puerto rico 27 from the northeast 13 from the midwest 22 from the south 1 from the central plains 13 from the west and 1 from puerto rico and 23 from foreign countries 11 from canada 12 from europe the united kingdom ireland and germany by merchandise category we derived approximately 63 of our sales from apparel including footwear 25 from home fashions and 12 from jewelry and accessories 

 

we consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment the tj maxx and marshalls store chains are managed as one division referred to as marmaxx and are reported as a single segment the winners and homesense chains which operate exclusively in canada are also managed as one division and are reported as a single segment each of our other store chains tk maxx homegoods aj wright and bob’s stores is operated as a division and reported as a separate segment more detailed information about our segments including financial information for each of the last three fiscal years can be found in note o to the consolidated financial statements 

 

unless otherwise indicated all store information is as of january 26 2008 and references to store square footage are to gross square feet fiscal 2006 means the fiscal year ended january 28 2006 fiscal 2007 means the fiscal year ended january 27 2007 fiscal 2008 means the fiscal year ended january 26 2008 and fiscal 2009 means the fiscal year ending january 31 2009 

 

segment overview 

 

marmaxx tj maxx and marshalls 

 

marmaxx operates the largest offprice retailers in the united states tj maxx and marshalls with 847 tj maxx stores in 48 states and 762 marshalls stores in 42 states and 14 in puerto rico at fiscal 2008 yearend we maintain the separate identities of the tj maxx and marshalls stores through product assortment instore initiatives marketing and store appearance this encourages our customers to shop at both chains 

 

tj maxx and marshalls primarily target female shoppers who have families with middle to uppermiddle incomes and who generally fit the profile of a department or specialty store customer these chains operate with a common buying and merchandising organization and have a consolidated administrative function including finance and human resources the combined organization known internally as the marmaxx group offers us increased leverage to purchase merchandise at favorable prices and allows us to operate with a lower cost structure these advantages are key to our ability to sell quality brand name merchandise at substantial discounts from department and specialty store regular prices 

 

tj maxx and marshalls sell quality brand name and designer merchandise at prices generally 2060 below department and specialty store regular prices both chains offer family apparel accessories giftware and home fashions within these broad categories tj maxx offers a shoe assortment for women and fine jewelry while marshalls offers a fullline footwear department and a larger men’s department we believe these expanded offerings further differentiate the shopping experience at tj maxx and marshalls driving traffic to both chains 

tj maxx and marshalls stores are generally located in suburban community shopping centers tj maxx stores average approximately 30000 square feet marshalls stores average approximately 32000 square feet we currently expect to add a net of approximately 45 stores in fiscal 2009 ultimately we believe that tj maxx and marshalls together can operate approximately 2000 stores in the united states and puerto rico an increase of approximately 200 stores over our previous estimate 

 

homegoods 

 

homegoods is our offprice retail chain that sells exclusively home fashions with a broad array of giftware home basics accent furniture lamps rugs accessories children’s furniture and seasonal merchandise for the home many of the homegoods stores are standalone stores however we also combine homegoods stores with a tj maxx or marshalls store in a superstore format the majority of which are dualbranded with both the tj maxx or marshalls logo and the homegoods logo in fiscal 2008 we continued to open a different superstore format called a “combo store” in which a homegoods store is located beside a tj maxx or marshalls store with interior passageways providing access between the stores this configuration is also dualbranded with both the tj maxx or marshalls logo and the homegoods logo 

 

standalone homegoods stores average approximately 27000 square feet in superstores which average approximately 53000 square feet we dedicate an average of 22000 square feet to homegoods the 289 stores open at the end of fiscal 2008 include 156 standalone stores 105 superstores and 28 combo stores in fiscal 2009 we plan to net 25 additional stores we believe that the us market could potentially support approximately 550 to 600 homegoods stores in the long term 

 

winners and homesense 

 

winners is the leading offprice retailer in canada offering offprice brand name and designer family apparel accessories including fine jewelry home fashions and giftware winners operates homesense our canadian offprice home fashions chain launched in fiscal 2001 like our homegoods chain homesense offers a wide and rapidly changing assortment of offprice home fashions including giftware home basics accent furniture lamps rugs accessories and seasonal merchandise we operate homesense in a standalone format as well as a superstore format where a homesense store and a winners store are combined or operate sidebyside 

 

at fiscal 2008 year end we operated 191 winners stores which averaged approximately 29000 square feet and 71 homesense stores which averaged approximately 24000 square feet we expect to add a net of 16 stores in canada in fiscal 2009 in the standalone and superstore format as well as the introduction of a new offprice concept ultimately we believe the canadian market can support approximately 230 winners stores and approximately 80 homesense stores 

 

tk maxx 

 

tk maxx operating in the united kingdom ireland and germany is the only major offprice retailer in any european country tk maxx utilizes the same offprice strategies employed by tj maxx marshalls and winners and offers the same types of merchandise at the end of fiscal 2008 we operated 221 tk maxx stores in the uk and ireland and 5 in germany which averaged approximately 31000 square feet we expect to add a total of 10 tk maxx stores in the uk and ireland in fiscal 2009 and believe that the uk and ireland can support approximately 275 stores in the long term in the fall of fiscal 2008 we opened our first 5 tk maxx stores in germany and we expect to open an additional 5 stores in germany in fiscal 2009 for a total of 10 stores in that country by the end of the year additionally tk maxx expects to open its first 5 homesense stores in the uk in fiscal 2009 which will mark the launch of our canadian homesense concept in europe 

 

aj wright

 item 1a risk factors 

 

the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in connection with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

 

our disclosure and analysis in this 2007 form 10k and in our 2007 annual report to shareholders contain some forwardlooking statements including some of the statements made under item 1 “business” item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and in our 2007 annual report to stockholders under “letter to shareholders” and “financial graphs” from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have generally identified such statements by using words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “project” “intend” “plan” “believe” “will” “target” “forecast” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance all statements that address activities events or developments that we intend expect or believe may occur in the future are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 in particular these include statements relating to future actions future performance or results of current and anticipated sales expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

 

we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

 

we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10q and 8k reports to the sec the risks that follow individually or in the aggregate are those that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

 

our revenue growth could be adversely affected if we do not continue to expand our operations successfully 

 

we have steadily expanded the number of chains and stores we operate and our selling square footage our revenue growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand successfully through new store openings as well as our ability to increase same store sales successful store growth requires selection of store locations in appropriate geographies availability of attractive stores or store sites in such locations and negotiation of acceptable terms competition for desirable sites and increases in real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities 

even if we succeed in opening new stores these new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores further expansion places demands upon us to manage rapid growth and we may not do so successfully 

 

our quarterly operating results can be subject to significant fluctuations and may fall short of either a prior quarter or investors’ expectations 

 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future our earnings may not continue to grow at rates similar to the growth rates achieved in recent years and may fall short of either a prior quarter or investors’ expectations if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors our share price may decline factors that could cause us not to meet analysts’ earnings expectations include some factors that are within our control such as the execution of our offprice buying selection pricing and mix of merchandise and inventory management including flow markon and markdowns and some factors that are not within our control including actions of competitors weather conditions economic conditions and consumer confidence and seasonality in addition if we do not repurchase the number of shares we contemplate pursuant to our stock repurchase programs our earnings per share may be adversely affected most of our operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not vary directly with the amount of sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term as a result if sales in a particular quarter are below expectations for that quarter we may not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter and therefore such a sales shortfall would have a disproportionate effect on our net income for the quarter we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to project sales and align expenses if we do not correctly forecast sales or appropriately adjust to actual results our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 

our future performance is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand within our existing markets and to extend our offprice model in new product lines chains and geographic regions 

 

our plans for the future require us to continue to expand rapidly within existing and new markets and geographies our growth strategy includes developing new ways to sell more merchandise within our existing stores continued expansion of our existing chains in our existing markets and countries expansion of these chains to new markets and countries and development and opening of new concepts all of which entail significant risk our growth is dependent upon our ability to successfully extend our offprice retail apparel and home fashions concepts in these ways if we are unable to successfully do so our future growth or financial performance could be adversely affected 

 

if we fail to execute our opportunistic buying and inventory management well our business could be adversely affected 

 

we purchase the majority of our inventory opportunistically with our buyers purchasing close to need to drive traffic to the stores and to increase same store sales the treasure hunt nature of the offprice buying experience requires continued replenishment of fresh high quality attractively priced merchandise in our stores while opportunistic buying enables our buyers to buy at the right time and price in the quantities we need and into market trends it places considerable discretion in our buyers subjecting us to risks on the timing quantity and nature of inventory flowing to the stores we rely on our expansive distribution infrastructure to support delivering goods to our stores on time we must effectively and timely distribute inventory to stores maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory and effectively manage pricing and markdowns we regularly change the allocation of floor space within our stores among product categories in response to demand failure to execute our opportunistic inventory buying and inventory management well could adversely affect our performance and our relationship with our customers 

 

if we do not implement our marketing advertising and promotional programs successfully or if our competitors are more effective than we are our revenue may be adversely affected 

 

we use marketing and promotional programs as one of the ways we attract customers to our stores we use various media for our promotional efforts including print television database marketing and direct marketing some of our competitors may have substantially larger marketing budgets which may provide them with a competitive advantage there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to effectively execute our marketing and promotional programs and any failure to do so could have a material effect on our revenue and results of operations 

our actual losses arising from the computer intrusion could exceed our reserve for our estimated probable losses and our reputation and business could be materially harmed as a result of any future data breach 

 

we suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions such intrusion or intrusions collectively the computer intrusion into portions of our computer system that process and store information related to customer transactions which was discovered during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and in which we believe that customer data were stolen various litigation has been or may be filed and various claims have been or may be otherwise asserted against us andor our acquiring banks for which we may be responsible relating to the computer intrusion we have settled some litigation and claims and while we intend to defend the remaining litigation and claims vigorously we cannot predict the outcome of such litigation and claims various governmental entities are investigating the actions of the company with respect to the computer intrusion although a number of governmental investigations have been completed we cannot predict what actions the governmental entities in the remaining investigations will take and what the consequences will be for us we have recorded a reserve that reflects our estimation of probable losses arising from the computer intrusion in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles while this reserve represents our best estimation of total potential cash liabilities from pending litigation proceedings investigations and other claims as well as legal and other costs and expenses arising from the computer intrusion there is no assurance that our actual losses will not be greater 

 

since discovering the computer intrusion we have taken steps designed to strengthen the security of our computer systems and protocols and have instituted an ongoing program with respect to data security nevertheless there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a future data compromise we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential customer information such as payment card and personal information further the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk are determined and controlled by the payment card industry not by us improper activities by third parties advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a further compromise or breach of our computer systems any such further compromises or breaches could cause interruptions in our operations damage to our reputation and customers’ willingness to shop in our stores and subject us to additional costs and liabilities 

 

our business is subject to seasonal influences and a decrease in sales or margins during the second half of the year could adversely affect our operating results 

 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the year which includes the backtoschool and yearend holiday season any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we fail to anticipate consumer trends and preferences our performance could suffer 

 

because our success depends on our ability to keep up with consumer trends we take steps to address the risk that we will fail to anticipate consumer preferences these include for example maintaining extensive contacts with vendors with other retailers as appropriate and with the national retail federation comparison shopping and monitoring fashion trends our buying departments and individual buyers monitor consumer trends and preferences in their respective product categories and areas we focus on the demographics associated with the customer bases of our divisions and we monitor such demographics in locating new and remodeled stores opportunistic buying close to need helps us respond to consumer preferences and trends nonetheless we still face the risk that we will fail to effectively anticipate consumer trends and preferences which could adversely affect our results 

 

we experience risks associated with our substantial size and scale 

 

we operate eight store chains in several countries some aspects of the businesses and operations of the chains are conducted with relative autonomy the large size of our operations our multiple businesses and the autonomy afforded to the chains increase the risk that systems and practices will not be implemented uniformly throughout our company and that information will not be appropriately shared across different chains and countries 

 

unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate could adversely affect our operating results 

 

customers’ willingness to shop and their demand for the merchandise in our stores are affected by adverse and unseasonable weather frequent or unusually heavy snow ice or rain storms severe cold or heat or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets could adversely affect our sales and increase markdowns in addition natural 

disasters such as hurricanes tornadoes and earthquakes or a combination of these or other factors could severely damage or destroy one or more of our stores or facilities located in the affected areas thereby disrupting our business operations 

 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for customers associates locations merchandise services and other important aspects of our business with many other local regional and national retailers in addition to other retail stores we also face competition from other retail distribution channels such as catalogues media and internet sites competition is characterized by many factors including price value quality brand names merchandise assortment advertising marketing and promotional activities service location reputation and credit availability if we are not able to compete effectively with regard to these factors our results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

if we do not attract and retain quality sales distribution center and other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel our performance could be adversely affected 

 

our performance is dependent on recruiting developing training and retaining quality sales distribution center and other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel many of our associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover the nature of the workforce in the retail industry subjects us to the risk of immigration law violations which risk has increased in recent years our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates minimum wage legislation changing demographics health and other insurance costs and state labor and employment requirements in the event of increasing wage rates if we do not increase our wages competitively our customer service could suffer because of a declining quality of our workforce or our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates in addition certain associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions because of the distinctive nature of our offprice model we must do significant internal training and development the market for retail management is highly competitive and in common with other retailers we face challenges in securing sufficient management talent changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates and management personnel could adversely affect our performance 

 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions of new businesses or divest any of our current businesses our business will be subject to additional risks 

 

we have grown our business in part through mergers and acquisitions integrating new stores and concepts can be a difficult task we may consider opportunities to acquire new businesses or to divest any of our current business segments acquisition or divestiture activities may divert attention of our executive management team away from the existing businesses we may do a less than optimal job of due diligence or evaluation of target companies divestiture also involves risks such as the risk of future exposure on lease obligations failure to execute on mergers or divestitures in a satisfactory manner could have an adverse effect on our future business prospects or our financial performance in the future 

 

if we are unable to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively our business could be disrupted or our sales or profitability could be reduced 

 

the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to successfully implement new technologies systems controls and adequate disaster recovery systems in addition we must protect the confidentiality of data of our company our associates our customers and other third parties the failure of our information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm our profitability 

 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to support new capital expansion operations debt repayment and stock repurchase program 

 

our business is dependent upon our operations generating strong cash flows to support our capital expansion requirements our general operating activities and our stock repurchase programs and to fund debt repayment and the availability of financing sources our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of availability of financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms could adversely affect our financial performance or our earnings per share growth 

consumer spending is adversely affected by general economic and other factors which are beyond our control and could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

 

interest rates recession inflation deflation consumer credit availability consumer debt levels energy costs tax rates and policy unemployment trends threats or possibilities of war terrorism or other global or national unrest actual or threatened epidemics political or financial instability and general economic political and other factors beyond our control have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending consumer spending can in turn affect sales at retailers including tjx these factors beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and performance 

 

issues with merchandise quality or safety could result in damage to our reputation sales or financial results 

 

merchandise we sell in our stores is subject to regulation of and regulatory standards set by various governmental authorities with respect to quality and safety regulations and standards in this area may change from time to time and substantial additional regulations and standards have been proposed our inability to comply on a timely basis with regulatory requirements could result in significant fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results issues with the quality and safety of merchandise we sell in our stores regardless of our fault or customer concerns about such issues could result in damage to our reputation lost sales uninsured product liability claims or losses merchandise recalls and increased costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

we are subject to import risks associated with importing merchandise from abroad 

 

many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a limited extent by us in many foreign countries imported merchandise is subject to various risks including potential disruptions in supply changes in duties tariffs quotas and voluntary export restrictions on imported merchandise strikes and other events affecting delivery consumer perceptions of the safety of imported merchandise particularly merchandise imported from the people’s republic of china and economic political or other problems in countries from or through which merchandise is imported political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise are beyond our control and could affect the availability and the price of our inventory 

 

our expanding international operations expose us to risks inherent in foreign operations 

 

we have a significant presence in canada the united kingdom and ireland and have recently expanded into germany we may also seek to expand into other international markets in the future our foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by our us operations as well as risks inherent in foreign operations such as understanding the retail climate and trends local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets complying with foreign laws rules and regulations and foreign currency fluctuations which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

 

litigation and changes in laws and regulations and accounting rules and principles could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

 

various aspects of our operations are subject to federal state or local laws rules and regulations any of which may change from time to time generally accepted accounting principles may change from time to time as well in addition we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business litigation regulatory developments and changes in accounting rules and principles could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance 

 

we own and lease for long periods significant amounts of real estate which subjects us to various financial risks 

 

we lease virtually all of our store locations generally for long terms and either own or lease other real estate on which our primary distribution centers and administrative offices are located accordingly we are subject to all of the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate while we have the right to terminate some of our leases under specified conditions by making specified payments we may not be able to cancel a particular lease if an existing or future store is not profitable and we decide to close it we may be committed to perform certain obligations under the applicable lease including among other things paying the rent for the balance of the lease term when we assign or sublease leased property we can remain liable if the sublessee does not perform in addition as each of the leases expires we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations 

our stock price may fluctuate based on market expectations 

 

the public trading of our stock is based in large part on market expectations that our business will continue to grow and that we will achieve certain levels of net income if the securities analysts that regularly follow our stock lower their rating or lower their projections for future growth and financial performance the market price of our stock is likely to drop in addition if our quarterly financial performance does not meet the expectations of securities analysts our stock price would likely decline the decrease in the stock price may be disproportionate to the shortfall in our financial performance 

 

our results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the price of oil 

 

prices of oil have fluctuated dramatically in the past these fluctuations may result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution utility costs for our retail stores and costs to purchase our products from suppliers a continued rise in oil prices could adversely affect consumer spending and demand for our products and increase our operating costs both of which could have an adverse effect on our performance

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

the following discussion contains forwardlooking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements due to various factors including those discussed in item 1a of this report under the section entitled “risk factors” 

 

the discussion that follows relates to our fiscal years ended january 26 2008 fiscal 2008 january 27 2007 fiscal 2007 and january 28 2006 fiscal 2006 

 

in november 2006 we announced our decision to close 34 aj wright stores as part of a repositioning of the chain the following discussion reviews our results from continuing operations which excludes the results of the closed aj wright stores the cost to close these stores was recorded as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and the operating income or loss from these stores is also presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented all references in the following discussion are to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated 

 

we suffered an unauthorized intrusion or intrusions such intrusion or intrusions collectively the “computer intrusion” into portions of our computer system which was discovered during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and in which we believe customer data were stolen see “provision for computer intrusion related costs” below and note b to the consolidated financial statements 

 

results of operations 

 

fiscal 2008 overview 

 

  

the following is a summary of our operating results at the consolidated level this discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment all references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share from continuing operations unless otherwise indicated all prior periods have been adjusted to reclassify the operating results of the aj wright store closings to discontinued operations see also note c to our consolidated financial statements 

 

net sales net sales for fiscal 2008 totaled 186 billion a 7 increase over net sales of 174 billion in fiscal 2007 net sales for fiscal 2007 increased 9 over net sales of 160 billion for fiscal 2006 the 7 increase in net sales for fiscal 2008 reflects a 3 increase from new stores and a 4 increase in same store sales the 9 increase in net sales for fiscal 2007 reflects increases of 5 from new stores and 4 from same store sales 

new stores are a major source of sales growth our consolidated store count increased by 4 in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 over the respective prior year periods and our selling square footage increased by 4 in fiscal 2008 and 5 in fiscal 2007 we expect to add 109 stores net of store closings in the fiscal year ending january 31 2009 fiscal 2009 a 4 increase in our consolidated store base we also expect to increase our selling square footage base by 4 

 

the 4 increase in same store sales for fiscal 2008 was driven by a strong performance at our international businesses as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates which contributed approximately two percentage points of growth at our domestic divisions sales of dresses footwear and accessories were strong partially offset by softer sales in the balance of the women’s apparel category home categories at marmaxx our largest division were also weak same store sales also benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments in marshalls during fiscal 2008 we rolled out expanded footwear departments in approximately 240 marshalls stores and plan to continue this expansion in approximately 200 marshalls stores in fiscal 2009 bringing the total to approximately 720 same store sales for fiscal 2008 at our international businesses were above the consolidated average within the u s the strongest regions were the west coast and the northeast while florida and the southeast trailed the us average overall transaction volume was slightly down more than offset by an increase in the average ticket 

 

the 4 increase in same store sales for fiscal 2007 was driven by growth in unit sales and increased transactions as well as the strong performance at our international businesses winners’ same store sales increased 5 and tk maxx same store sales increased 6 both in local currency net sales for fiscal 2007 reflected growth in both apparel and home fashions within apparel jewelry accessories and footwear combined as well as misses sportswear and dresses performed well as for home fashions giftware and home decorative products performed well while our “soft” home categories bedding linens etc did not perform to our expectations same store sales also benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments in marshalls during fiscal 2007 we added 134 expanded footwear departments bringing the total number of stores with the expanded footwear departments to 280 these stores had same store sales growth that exceeded the chain average the expansion of jewelry and accessory departments at tj maxx was substantially completed during fiscal 2007 with 686 out of the total 821 stores having expanded departments at year end in the u s same store sales increased across almost all regions with the northeast southwest and midatlantic areas experiencing the strongest growth same store sales growth was favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates which contributed approximately one percentage point of growth 

 

we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the consolidated same store percentage is immaterial consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in us dollars we also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of the divisional operating performance 

 

the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales 

 

 

 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 755 in fiscal 2008 759 in fiscal 2007 and 766 in fiscal 2006 this ratio for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 reflected an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin 05 percentage points due to improved markon and lower markdowns throughout fiscal 2008 we solidly executed our offprice fundamentals buying close to need and taking advantage of opportunities in the market place this merchandise margin improvement was partially 

offset by a slight increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales all other buying and occupancy costs remained relatively flat as compared to the same period last year 

 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2007 as compared with fiscal 2006 reflected an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin 04 percentage points as well as expense leverage due to our cost containment initiatives and the impact of strong same store sales growth these improvements in the fiscal 2007 expense ratio were partially offset by increases in some operating costs as a percentage of net sales primarily occupancy costs 02 percentage points 

 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 168 in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 and was 169 in fiscal 2006 the fiscal 2008 expense ratio remained consistent with the prior year with a planned increase in advertising costs 01 percentage point and a fourth quarter impairment charge at our bob’s stores division 01 percentage point being offset by our continuing cost containment initiatives the decrease in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 reflects expense leverage across most categories partially offset by a planned increase in marketing expense 01 percentage point 

 

provision for computer intrusion related costs we face potential liabilities and costs as a result of claims litigation and investigations with respect to the computer intrusion during the first six months of fiscal 2008 we expensed pretax costs of 378 million for costs we incurred related to the computer intrusion in the second quarter of fiscal 2008 we were able to reasonably estimate our potential losses related to the computer intrusion and accordingly established a pretax reserve of 1781 million and recorded a pretax charge in that amount subsequently as previously disclosed we settled the purported customer class actions subject to final court approval settled claims of visa usa visa inc and substantially all us visa issuers and settled with most of the named plaintiffs in the purported financial institution class action during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we reduced our reserve and the provision for computer intrusion related costs by 189 million as a result of insurance proceeds with respect to the computer intrusion which had not previously been reflected in the reserve as well as a reduction in our estimated legal and other fees as we have continued to resolve outstanding disputes litigation and investigations as of january 26 2008 our reserve balance was 1173 million reflecting amounts paid for settlements primarily the visa settlement legal and other fees our reserve reflects our current estimation of probable losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with respect to the computer intrusion and includes our current estimation of total potential cash liabilities from pending litigation proceedings investigations and other claims as well as legal and other costs and expenses arising from the computer intrusion in addition we expect to record noncash costs with respect to the customer class actions settlement if finally approved when incurred which we do not expect to be material to our financial statements as an estimate our reserve is subject to uncertainty and our actual costs may vary from our current estimate and such variations may be material we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserve to adjust for developments in the course and resolution of litigation claims and investigations and related expenses and for other changes in our estimates 

 

interest income expense net interest income expense net amounted to income of 16 million for fiscal 2008 expense of 156 million for fiscal 2007 and expense of 296 million in fiscal 2006 these changes were the result of interest income totaling 407 million in the fiscal 2008 versus 236 million for fiscal 2007 and 94 million in fiscal 2006 the additional interest income in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 as well as fiscal 2007 versus fiscal 2006 was due to higher cash balances available for investment as well as higher interest rates earned on our investments 

 

income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was 379 in fiscal 2008 377 in fiscal 2007 and 316 in fiscal 2006 the increase in the tax rate for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 reflects the absence of some fiscal 2007 onetime benefits as well as an increase due to certain fin 48 tax positions partially offset by the favorable impact of increased income at our foreign operations and increased foreign tax credits during fiscal 2008 we changed our assertion regarding the undistributed earnings of one of our puerto rican subsidiaries beginning in fiscal 2008’s third quarter we concluded that the undistributed earnings of our puerto rican subsidiary that operates marshalls stores would not be permanently reinvested as a result we recorded a deferred tax liability for the effect of the undistributed income and in addition we were able to fully recognize the benefit of accumulated foreign tax credits that had been earned at the subsidiary level the net impact of this change in assertion was a reduction in our effective income tax rate of 04 percentage points prior to this period the earnings of this puerto rican subsidiary were deemed to be indefinitely reinvested 

 

the increase in the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate reflected the absence of onetime tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 benefit for repatriation of earnings from our canadian subsidiary and the correction of accounting for the tax impact of foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans which favorably impacted the fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate by 68 percentage points the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate benefited through july 20 

2006 from the tax treatment of foreign currency gains and losses on certain intercompany loans between winners and tjx this tax treatment reduced the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate by 02 percentage points effective july 20 2006 we redesignated one of these intercompany loans and the related hedge as a net investment in our foreign operations and gains and losses on these items after july 20 2006 are recorded in other comprehensive income net of tax effects in addition the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by increased income at our foreign operations a portion of which is taxed at a lower rate than our domestic operations as well as settlement of a state tax assessment for less than the related reserves combined these two items reduced the effective income tax rate by 06 percentage points as compared to fiscal 2006 

 

income from continuing operations income from continuing operations was 7718 million in fiscal 2008 7768 million in fiscal 2007 and 6898 million in fiscal 2006 income from continuing operations per share was 166 in fiscal 2008 163 in fiscal 2007 and 141 in fiscal 2006 unlike many companies in the retail industry we did not have a 53 rd week in fiscal 2007 but will have a 53 rd week in fiscal 2009 

 

income from continuing operations for fiscal 2008 was adversely impacted by the charge relating to the computer intrusion of approximately 119 million after tax which reduced earnings per share by 025 per share income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 was adversely impacted by the charge relating to the computer intrusion of approximately 3 million after tax which reduced fourth quarter earnings per share by 001 per share but did not change full year earnings per share 

 

income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of 47 million or 010 per share due to the repatriation of foreign earnings as well as a tax benefit of 22 million or 004 per share relating to the correction of a previously established deferred tax liability in addition income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was adversely impacted by approximately 12 million or 002 per share due to certain third quarter events these third quarter events included the aftertax cost of executive resignation agreements primarily with respect to our former ceo 5 million ecommerce exit costs and third quarter operating losses 6 million and uninsured losses due to third quarter hurricanes including the estimated impact of lost sales 6 million all of which were partially offset by a gain from a visamastercard antitrust litigation settlement 5 million 

 

favorable changes in currency exchange rates added approximately 005 to our earnings per share in fiscal 2008 and approximately 003 to our earnings per share in fiscal 2007 in addition the change in earnings per share in each fiscal year was favorably impacted by our share repurchase program during fiscal 2008 we repurchased 333 million shares of our stock at a cost of 950 million in fiscal 2007 we repurchased 220 million shares of our stock at a cost of 557 million which was less than planned as we temporarily suspended our buyback activity in december 2006 as a result of the discovery and investigation of the computer intrusion we plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2009 with planned purchases of approximately 900 million 

 

discontinued operations and net income our results from continuing operations exclude the results of operations and the cost of closing 34 aj wright stores see “segment information — aj wright” below and note c to the consolidated financial statements for more information net income which includes the impact of discontinued operations was 7718 million or 166 per share for fiscal 2008 7380 million or 155 per share for fiscal 2007 and 6904 million or 141 per share for fiscal 2006 

 

segment information the following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments we consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income before general corporate expense provision for computer intrusion related costs and interest “segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities in addition this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from 

operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments us dollars in millions 

 

marmaxx 

 

 

 

marmaxx which operates the tj maxx and marshalls store chains posted a 1 same store sales increase in fiscal 2008 compared to a 2 same store sales increase in fiscal 2007 sales at marmaxx for fiscal 2008 reflected strong same store sales increases in less weathersensitive categories such as dresses footwear and accessories during fiscal 2008 we added expanded footwear departments to approximately 240 marshalls stores and plan to add expanded departments to an additional 200 stores in fiscal 2009 taking the total to approximately 720 home categories at marmaxx underperformed in fiscal 2008 and we have taken measures to improve in this area of our execution geographically in fiscal 2008 same store sales for the northeast southwest and west coast were above the chain average while same store sales in florida and the midwest were below the chain average 

 

segment profit as a percentage of net sales “segment margin” or “segment profit margin” increased to 97 in fiscal 2008 from 94 in fiscal 2007 segment margin was favorably impacted by merchandise margins which increased 04 percentage points as a percentage of net sales due to lower markdowns and a higher markon as well as some expense leverage due to our cost containment measures these improvements in segment margin were partly offset by an increase in occupancy costs 02 percentage points and a planned increase in advertising expense 01 percentage point as of january 26 2008 average inventories per store were down 2 compared to an 8 increase at the prior year end the increase at the prior year end was primarily due to our instock position on spring transitional goods and an increase in average ticket 

 

segment margin increased to 94 in fiscal 2007 from 90 in fiscal 2006 the increase was largely driven by a 02 percentage point improvement in merchandise margin primarily due to lower markdowns and expense leverage across most categories due to our cost containment initiatives additionally fiscal 2007 included the favorable impact on current year casualty insurance and employee medical costs of favorable claims experience these improvements in segment margin were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs 02 percentage points and a planned increase in marketing costs 01 percentage point 

 

we added a net of 54 new stores tj maxx or marshalls in fiscal 2008 and increased total selling square footage of the division by 3 we expect to open approximately 45 new stores net of closings in fiscal 2009 increasing the marmaxx store base by 3 and increasing its selling square footage by 2 

winners and homesense 

 

 

 

net sales for winners and homesense our canadian businesses for fiscal 2008 increased by 17 over fiscal 2007 with approximately onehalf of this growth due to currency exchange rates same store sales in local currency increased by 5 in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 same store sales for fiscal 2008 were positively impacted by sales of home fashions footwear jewelry and accessories homesense continued to perform well favorably impacting same store sales in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 

 

segment profit margin for fiscal 2008 increased 11 percentage points to 115 compared to 104 for fiscal 2007 this improvement in segment margin was primarily due to improved expense ratios leverage from the 5 same store sales increase as well as cost containment initiatives currency exchange rates increased segment profit by approximately 24 million for fiscal 2008 most of this increase is due to currency translation which also impacts sales growth and therefore has no impact on segment margin the increase in segment profit due to currency exchange rates also included the favorable impact of the marktomarket adjustment of inventory hedge contracts which increased segment margin by 03 percentage points the inventory hedge contracts are designed to lock in the cost of merchandise purchases that are denominated in us dollars the fiscal 2008 segment margin also reflected an increase in merchandise margin primarily due to increased markon as well the favorable impact of cost containment initiatives and strong same store sales results on expense ratios 

 

segment profit margin for fiscal 2007 increased 21 percentage points to 104 compared to 83 for fiscal 2006 this improvement in segment margin was primarily due to a 14 percentage point increase in merchandise margins improved markon and lower markdowns combined with improved expense ratios leverage from the 5 same store sales increase as well as cost containment initiatives these increases were partially offset by a planned increase in advertising costs which increased 02 percentage points as a percentage of net sales 

 

we added a net of 7 winners stores and 3 homesense stores in fiscal 2008 and expanded selling square footage in canada by 5 we expect to add a net of 9 winners and 4 homesense stores in fiscal 2009 additionally we plan to test a new offprice concept with 3 new stores in canada in fiscal 2009 which will bring our total canadian store base up by 5 and increase selling square footage by 6 the store counts include the winners and homesense portions of this division’s superstores which either combine a winners store with a homesense store or operates them sidebyside as of january 26 2008 we operated 30 of these superstores 

 

tk maxx 

 

 

net sales for fiscal 2008 for tk maxx operating in the united kingdom ireland and germany increased by 19 over fiscal 2007 with approximately 40 of this growth due to currency exchange rates tk maxx had a strong same store sales increase of 6 in local currency for fiscal 2008 same store sales for home fashions footwear accessories and dresses performed above the chain average while other apparel categories were generally below the chain average 

 

segment profit for fiscal 2008 increased 16 to 1272 million while segment margin decreased slightly to 57 compared to fiscal 2007 currency exchange rates favorably impacted segment profit by approximately 10 million in fiscal 2008 but did not impact the segment profit margin during fiscal 2008 tk maxx opened its first 5 stores in germany which reduced segment profit for fiscal 2008 by 11 million and reduced the fiscal 2008 segment margin by 06 percentage points the tk maxx stores in the uk and ireland increased segment margin for fiscal 2008 by 04 percentage points which reflected a slightly improved merchandise margin as well as the favorable impact of same store sales growth on expense ratios and the division’s cost containment efforts 

 

segment profit margin improved to 59 of sales for fiscal 2007 compared to 46 for fiscal 2006 the 13 percentage point improvement was due to merchandise margin which was up 09 percentage points primarily due to lower markdowns as well as expense leverage from the 9 same store sales increase these improvements were partially offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to higher costs for rent utilities and property taxes and costs associated with store relocations 

 

we added a net of 16 tk maxx stores including 5 in germany in fiscal 2008 and increased the division’s selling square footage by 10 in fiscal 2009 we plan to open a net of 15 tk maxx stores including another 5 in germany and expect to introduce the homesense concept in europe with a planned opening of 5 such stores overall we expect to expand selling square footage by 9 

 

homegoods 

 

 

 

homegoods’ net sales for fiscal 2008 increased 8 compared to fiscal 2007 and same store sales increased 3 in fiscal 2008 segment margin of 51 for fiscal 2008 improved over fiscal 2007 primarily due to improved merchandise margins and the leveraging of expenses particularly occupancy costs these segment margin improvements were offset in part by an increase in advertising expenses as a percentage of net sales we attribute this division’s strong performance to solid execution of offprice buying and flow of product 

 

homegoods’ same store sales grew 4 in fiscal 2007 due to strong growth in giftware and home decorative products segment profit increased to 609 million from 284 million and segment profit margin almost doubled to 45 of sales the increase in segment profit margin resulted primarily from leveraging expenses across most categories most notably in distribution center and occupancy expenses 

 

we opened a net of 19 homegoods stores in fiscal 2008 a 7 increase and increased selling square footage of the division by 7 in fiscal 2009 we plan to add a net of 25 homegoods stores and increase selling square footage by 9 

 

aj wright 

 

 

  

aj wright’s net sales increased 5 for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 aj wright’s same store sales increased 2 for fiscal 2008 and segment loss for fiscal 2008 was 18 million compared to 103 million for fiscal 2007 this improvement was primarily due to stronger merchandise margin a reduction in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales and the impact of cost containment initiatives 

 

aj wright’s same store sales increased 3 for fiscal 2007 and segment loss for fiscal 2007 increased to 103 million this decline compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily the result of a decrease in merchandise margin 12 percentage points due to markdowns on belowplan sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 as part of a plan to reposition this business we identified 34 underperforming aj wright stores for closing virtually all of which were closed by fiscal 2007 year end the cost to close these stores and their historical operating results are presented as discontinued operations by closing these marginally profitable stores we reduced the number of advertising markets in which aj wright operates enabling better marketing leverage as well as enabling greater efficiencies in store operations and logistics the store closings also allowed management to focus their attention and resources on the remaining better performing stores 

 

we currently plan to add a net of 5 aj wright stores in fiscal 2009 we continue to believe that aj wright can be a growth vehicle for tjx with its very sizable target customer demographic 

 

bob’s stores 

 

 

 

bob’s stores’ net sales increased 3 for fiscal 2008 and same store sales increased 5 with footwear performing well bob’s stores segment loss for fiscal 2008 was flat compared to the prior year merchandise margin increases were driven by improved markon the result of better buying which more than offset increases in promotional markdowns as we significantly increased the level of promotions in this division additionally in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 we recorded an impairment charge of approximately 8 million the impairment charge related to certain long lived assets and intangible assets at bob’s stores and represented the excess of recorded carrying values over the estimated fair value of these assets 

 

for fiscal 2009 we do not plan to open any new stores for this division as we continue to evaluate this business 

 

general corporate expense 

 

 

 

general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments this item includes the costs of the corporate office including the compensation and benefits including stock based compensation for senior corporate management payroll and operating costs of the corporate departments of accounting and budgeting internal audit compliance treasury investor relations tax risk management legal human resources and systems and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff in addition general corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing retirees and nonoperating costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions general corporate expense is included in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 

 

the comparison of general corporate expense in fiscal 2008 versus fiscal 2007 reflected an increase in corporate support costs in fiscal 2008 and a 5 million charge in fiscal 2007 relating to the cost of a workforce reduction and other termination benefits at the corporate level 

 

in comparing general corporate expense for fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2006 fiscal 2007 included the 5 million charge referred to above while fiscal 2006 included costs of 9 million associated with executive resignation agreements and 6 million of 

costs to exit the ecommerce business the increase in other general corporate expenses in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 also reflected increases in corporate payroll corporate marketing and consulting costs charitable contributions and european expansion costs 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

operating activities 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 13611 million in fiscal 2008 11950 million in fiscal 2007 and 11580 million in fiscal 2006 the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings 

 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2008 increased by 1661 million net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization for fiscal 2008 increased 500 million the change in inventory net of accounts payable from prior yearend levels was a significant component of operating cash flows in fiscal 2008 the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable favorably impacted operating cash flows by 49 million compared to a use of cash of 1512 million in fiscal 2007 additionally fiscal 2008 operating cash flows were favorably impacted by the change in income taxes payable these increases in fiscal 2008 operating cash flows as compared to fiscal 2007 were offset by the unfavorable cash flow impact of the deferred income tax provision changes in accrued expenses and other liabilities and changes in accounts receivable 

 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2007 increased by 370 million compared to fiscal 2006 driven by an increase in net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization of 864 million in fiscal 2007 the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of 1512 million compared to a source of cash of 262 million in fiscal 2006 fiscal 2007 operating cash flows were also reduced by higher income tax payments these reductions in fiscal 2007 operating cash flows as compared to fiscal 2006 were offset by the favorable cash flow impact of changes in deferred income taxes accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 

 

the variance in operating cash flows attributable to the change in the net inventory position over the last three fiscal years is largely explained by our average per store inventory levels at each year end period average per store inventories at january 26 2008 including inventory on hand at our distribution centers increased 2 compared to an increase of 7 at january 27 2007 this compares to inventories per store at january 28 2006 that were down 11 compared to the prior year 

 

discontinued operations reserve we have a reserve for future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases associated with 34 of our aj wright stores see note c to the consolidated financial statements as well as leases of former tjx businesses the balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below 

 

 

 

the exit costs related to 34 of our aj wright stores resulted in an addition to the reserve of 62 million in fiscal 2007 the other additions to the reserve for lease related obligations in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 are the result of periodic adjustments to our estimated lease obligations of our former businesses and are offset by income from creditor recoveries of a similar amount the lease related charges against the reserve during fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 relate primarily to our former businesses the fixed asset writeoffs and other charges against the reserve for fiscal 2007 and all the charges against the reserve in fiscal 2008 relate primarily to the 34 aj wright closed stores virtually all of which were closed at the end of fiscal 2007 

approximately 32 million of the fiscal 2008 reserve balance and 43 million of the fiscal 2007 reserve balance relates to the aj wright store closings primarily our estimation of lease costs net of estimated subtenant income the remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost of claims updated quarterly that have been or we believe are likely to be made against us for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations at january 26 2008 substantially all the leases of former businesses that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against us had been resolved the actual net cost of aj wright lease obligations may differ from our original estimate although our actual costs with respect to the lease obligations of former businesses may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve and we may incur costs for leases from these former businesses that were not terminated or had not expired we do not expect to incur any material costs related to these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts estimated we estimate that the majority of the discontinued operations reserve will be paid in the next three to five years the actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how the remaining lease obligations are actually settled 

 

we may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of bj’s wholesale club a former tjx business for which bj’s wholesale club is primarily liable our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to us with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of bj’s wholesale club 

 

offbalance sheet liabilities we have contingent obligations on leases for which we were a lessee or guarantor which were assigned to third parties without tjx being released by the landlords over many years we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties with the exception of leases of our former businesses discussed above we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases and accordingly we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them which could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants does not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases 

 

we also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate we estimate the undiscounted obligations not reflected in our reserves of leases of closed stores of continuing operations bj’s wholesale club leases discussed above and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations to be approximately 105 million as of january 26 2008 we believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to us and to the extent they do will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors 

 

we are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold specified environmental matters or certain income taxes these obligations are typically limited in time and amount there are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations 

 

investing activities  

 

our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three years as set forth in the table below 

 

 

 

we expect that capital expenditures will approximate 575 million for fiscal 2009 which we expect to pay through internally generated funds this includes 140 million for new stores 288 million for store renovations expansions and improvements and 147 million for our office and distribution centers the planned increase in capital expenditures is attributable to increased spending on renovations and improvements to existing stores particularly tj maxx marshalls and tk maxx 

 

financing activities  

 

cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 9527 million in fiscal 2008 4180 million in fiscal 2007 and 5037 million in fiscal 2006 the majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program 

we spent 9502 million in fiscal 2008 5572 million in fiscal 2007 and 6000 million in fiscal 2006 under our stock repurchase programs we repurchased 333 million shares in fiscal 2008 220 million shares in fiscal 2007 and 259 million shares in fiscal 2006 all shares repurchased were retired repurchases were suspended late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and for most of the first quarter of fiscal 2008 as a result of the discovery of the computer intrusion we record the repurchase of our stock on a cash basis and the amounts reflected in the financial statements may vary from the above due to the timing of the settlement of our repurchases of the 9502 million of repurchases made during fiscal 2008 4362 million completed a 1 billion stock repurchase program initially authorized in october 2005 and 5140 million were made under the 1 billion stock repurchase program authorized in january 2007 in february 2008 our board of directors authorized an additional multiyear stock repurchase plan of 1 billion 

 

in january 2006 we entered into a c235 million term credit facility through our canadian division winners due in january 2010 this debt is guaranteed by tjx interest is payable on borrowings under this facility at rates equal to or less than canadian prime rate winners entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively established a fixed interest rate of approximately 45 on this debt the proceeds were used to fund the repatriation of earnings from our canadian division as well as other general corporate purposes of this division financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on longterm debt of 100 million in fiscal 2006 for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 there were no scheduled principal payments on longterm debt 

 

we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 036 per share in fiscal 2008 028 per share in fiscal 2007 and 024 per share in fiscal 2006 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 1515 million in fiscal 2008 1229 million in fiscal 2007 and 1053 million in fiscal 2006 financing activities also included proceeds of 1341 million in fiscal 2008 2602 million in fiscal 2007 and 1024 million in fiscal 2006 from the exercise of employee stock options 

 

we traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of shortterm commercial paper in fiscal 2007 we amended our 500 million fouryear revolving credit facility and our 500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility initially entered into in fiscal 2006 to extend the maturity dates of these agreements until may 2010 and may 2011 respectively these agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings we also have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we issue commercial paper from time to time the revolving credit facilities are used as back up to our commercial paper program as of january 26 2008 there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities there were no borrowings on our credit facilities during fiscal 2008 the maximum amount of our us shortterm borrowings outstanding was 205 million during fiscal 2007 and 567 million during fiscal 2006 the weighted average interest rate on our us shortterm borrowings was 535 in fiscal 2007 and 369 in fiscal 2006 

 

as of january 26 2008 and january 27 2007 winners had two credit lines one for c10 million for operating expenses and one c10 million letter of credit facility the maximum amount outstanding under our canadian credit line for operating expenses was c57 million in fiscal 2008 c38 million in fiscal 2007 and c46 million in fiscal 2006 and there were no amounts outstanding on either of these lines at the end of fiscal 2008 or fiscal 2007 as of january 26 2008 tk maxx had credit lines totaling £20 million the maximum amount outstanding in fiscal 2008 was £164 million and there were no outstanding borrowings at january 26 2008 or january 27 2007 

 

we believe that internally generated funds and our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs for at least the next twelve months see note d to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our longterm debt and available financing sources 

 

contractual obligations as of january 26 2008 we had payment obligations including current installments under longterm debt arrangements leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows in thousands 

 

 

the longterm debt obligations above include estimated interest costs and assume that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal 2014 if none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted the notes will mature in fiscal 2022 the effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based on their values as of january 26 2008 

 

the lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay these costs were approximately onethird of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended january 26 2008 

 

our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise purchase orders for capital expenditures supplies and other operating needs commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services and commitments under executive employment and other agreements we excluded longterm agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty 

 

we also have longterm liabilities which include 1254 million for employee compensation and benefits most of which will come due beyond five years derivative contracts of approximately 1431 million the majority of which come due in fiscal 2010 1505 million for accrued rent the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table and 2692 million for uncertain tax positions for which it is not reasonably possible to predict when it may be paid 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

we must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to the areas described below we believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained had alternative assumptions been selected would not be materially different from the results we have reported 

 

inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory on a firstin firstout basis under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory this method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage a significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods in addition as a normal business practice we have a specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing the need for management estimates inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but is based on a full physical inventory near the fiscal year end thus the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results but is not a factor in full year results overall we believe that the retail method coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated lastly many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions which ultimately affect the value of the inventory our offprice businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors bob’s stores the valueoriented retailer we acquired in december 2003 does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain conditions are met these arrangements may have some impact on bob’s stores’ inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results 

 

impairment of longlived assets we review the recoverability of the carrying value of our longlived assets at least annually and whenever events or circumstances occur that would indicate that their carrying amounts are not recoverable significant judgments are involved in projecting the cash flows of individual stores and our business units and involve a number of factors including historical trends recent performance and general economic assumptions if it is determined that an impairment of longlived assets has occurred we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets over the estimated fair value of the assets 

 

retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates we are required to make assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the longterm rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period the discount rate which we determine annually based on market interest rates and our estimated longterm rate of return which can differ considerably from actual returns are two factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of 

retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan we have made contributions of 65 million which exceeded the minimum required over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan 

 

casualty insurance in july 2007 we entered into a fixed premium program for our casualty insurance our casualty insurance program prior to 2007 requires us to estimate the total claims we will incur as a component of our annual insurance cost the estimated claims are developed with the assistance of an actuary based on historical experience and other factors these estimates involve significant judgements and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates if our estimate for the claims component of our casualty insurance expense for fiscal 2008 were to change by 10 the fiscal 2008 pretax cost would increase or decrease by approximately 2 million a large portion of these claims are funded with a nonrefundable payment during the policy year offsetting our estimated claims accrual we had a net accrual of 264 million for the unfunded portion of our casualty insurance program as of january 26 2008 

 

accounting for taxes like many large corporations we are regularly under audit by united states federal state local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions we accrue charges for possible exposures based on the annual evaluations of tax positions we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves our effective income tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted the internal revenue service has examined the fiscal years ended january 2000 through january 2003 and several refund claims have been approved by irs appeals office and are awaiting confirmation by the congressional joint tax committee we also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process 

 

reserves for computer intrusion related costs and for discontinued operations as discussed in note b and note l to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the management’s discussion and analysis we have reserves established for probable losses arising out of the computer intrusion and for leases relating to operations discontinued by us where we were the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned or sublet to third parties the computer intrusion reserve requires us to make numerous estimates and assumptions about the outcome and costs of claims litigation and investigations and the related costs and expenses we will incur we make these estimates based on our best judgments of the outcome of such claims litigation and investigation and related costs and expenses the leases relating to discontinued operations are longterm obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions including whether and for how long we remain obligated with respect to a particular lease the extent to which an assignee or subtenant will assume our obligation under the leases amounts of subtenant income how a particular obligation may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors including indemnification may exist with regard to any liability we develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location we believe that our current reserves are a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcomes and that the reserves should be adequate to cover the ultimate cash costs we will incur however actual results may differ from our current estimates and such differences could be material we may decrease or increase the amount of our reserves to adjust for developments relating to the underlying assumptions 

 

loss contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to us but which will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur our management where relevant with the assistance of our legal counsel assesses such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against us or claims that may result in such proceedings our legal counsel assists us in evaluating the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or claims as well as the perceived merits of the relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then we will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not estimable 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 requires companies to disclose fair value measurements according to a fair value hierarchy as defined in the standard additionally companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding fair value measurements in one of the categories level 3 including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category 

of assets and liabilities sfas no 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years and will be applied prospectively sfas no 157 is effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 in february 2008 the fasb issued a staff position that will 1 partially defer the effective date of sfas no 157 for one year for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities and 2 remove certain leasing transactions from the scope of sfas no 157 we believe the adoption of sfas no 157 will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities — including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” sfas no 159 sfas no 159 provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different fair value measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities sfas no 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those years and will be effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we do not believe that sfas no 159 will have a material impact on our financial statements

we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our canadian winners and homesense and european tk maxx operations as more fully described in notes a and e to the consolidated financial statements we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations intercompany transactions with these operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations with derivative financial instruments we enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures most of these gains and losses are recorded directly in shareholders’ equity the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of january 26 2008 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our cash equivalents and shortterm investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by tjx in addition changes in the gross amount of our borrowings and future changes in interest rates will affect our future interest expense we occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing however we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during fiscal 2008 as of january 26 2008 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

market risk 

 

the assets of our qualified pension plan a large portion of which is invested in equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market we allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties investments in general are exposed to various risks such as interest rate credit and overall market volatility as such it is reasonably possible that changes in the values of investments will occur in the near term and such changes could affect the amounts reported

business overview 

 

 

we are the leading offprice retailer of apparel and home fashions in the united states and worldwide our tj maxx marshalls and aj wright chains in the united states our winners chain in canada and our tk maxx chain in europe sell offprice family apparel and home fashions our homegoods chain in the united states and our homesense chain operated by winners in canada sell offprice home fashions the target customer for all of our offprice chains except aj wright is the middleto uppermiddle income shopper with the same profile as a department or specialty store customer aj wright targets the moderateincome customer our seven offprice chains are synergistic in their philosophies and operating platforms our eighth chain bob’s stores was acquired in december 2003 and is a valueoriented branded apparel chain based in the northeastern united states that offers casual family apparel bob’s stores’ target customer demographic spans the moderateto uppermiddle income bracket 

 

 

our offprice mission is to deliver an exciting fresh and rapidly changing assortment of brandname merchandise at excellent values to our customers we define value as the combination of quality brand fashion and price with over 450 buyers and over 10000 vendors worldwide and over 2400 stores we believe we are well positioned to continue accomplishing this goal our key strengths include 

 

  

 

as an offprice retailer we offer quality name brand and designer family apparel and home fashions every day at substantial savings to comparable department and specialty store regular prices we can offer these everyday savings as a result of our opportunistic buying strategies disciplined inventory management including rapid inventory turns and low expense structure 

 

 

in our offprice chains we purchase the majority of our inventory opportunistically in contrast to traditional retailers that order goods far in advance of the time they appear on the selling floor tjx buyers are in the marketplace virtually every week buying primarily for the current selling season by maintaining a liquid inventory position our buyers can buy close to need enabling them to buy into current market trends and take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace due to the unpredictable nature of consumer demand in the highly fragmented apparel and home fashions marketplace and the mismatch of supply and demand we are regularly able to buy the vast majority of our inventory directly from manufacturers with some merchandise coming from other retailers and other sources we purchase virtually all of our inventory for our offprice stores at discounts from initial wholesale prices although we generally purchase merchandise for our offprice chains to sell in the current season we purchase a limited quantity of pack away merchandise that we buy specifically to warehouse and sell in a future selling season we are willing to purchase less than a full assortment of styles and sizes we pay promptly and do not ask for typical retail concessions in our offprice chains such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances or delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries or return privileges our financial strength strong reputation and ability to purchase large quantities of merchandise and sell it through our geographically diverse network of stores provide us excellent access to leading branded merchandise our opportunistic buying permits us to consistently offer our customers in our offprice chains a rapidly changing merchandise assortment at everyday values that are below department and specialty store regular prices 

 

 

we are extremely disciplined in our inventory management and we rapidly turn the inventory in our offprice chains we rely heavily on sophisticated internally developed inventory systems and controls that permit a virtually continuous flow of merchandise into our stores and an expansive distribution infrastructure that supports our closetoneed buying by delivering goods to our stores quickly and efficiently for example highly automated storage and distribution systems track allocate and deliver an average of approximately 11000 items per week to each tj maxx and marshalls store in addition specialized computer inventory planning purchasing and monitoring systems 

  coupled with warehouse storage processing handling and shipping systems permit a continuous evaluation and rapid replenishment of store inventory pricing markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment requirements are determined centrally using information provided by pointofsale computer terminals and are designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner these inventory management and distribution systems allow us to achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of product and sell substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods 

 

 

we operate with a low cost structure relative to many other retailers our stores are generally located in community shopping centers while we seek to provide a pleasant easy shopping environment with emphasis on customer convenience we do not spend heavily on store fixtures our selling floor space is flexible without walls between departments and largely free of permanent fixtures so we can easily expand and contract departments in response to customer demand and available merchandise also our large retail presence strong financial position and expertise in the real estate market allow us generally to obtain favorable lease terms in our offprice chains our advertising budget as a percentage of sales remains low compared to traditional department and specialty stores although we increased our advertising and other marketing spending in fiscal 2007 as compared to prior years our high salespersquarefoot productivity and rapid inventory turnover also provide expense efficiencies 

 

 

with all of our offprice chains operating with the same offprice strategies and systems we are able to capitalize upon expertise best practices and new ideas across our chains develop associates by transferring them from one chain to another and grow our various businesses more efficiently and effectively 

 

 

during the fiscal year ended january 27 2007 we derived 78 of our sales from the united states 28 from the northeast 14 from the midwest 23 from the south and 13 from the west 21 from foreign countries 10 from canada 11 from europe the united kingdom and ireland and 1 from puerto rico by merchandise category we derived approximately 63 of our sales from apparel including footwear 25 from home fashions and 12 from jewelry and accessories 

 

 

we consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment the tj maxx and marshalls store chains are managed as one division referred to as marmaxx and are reported as a single segment the winners and homesense chains which operate exclusively in canada are also managed as one division and are reported as a single segment each of our other store chains tk maxx homegoods aj wright and bob’s stores is operated as a division and reported as a separate segment more detailed information about our segments including financial information for each of the last three fiscal years can be found in note o to the consolidated financial statements 

 

 

unless otherwise indicated all store information is as of january 27 2007 and references to store square footage are to gross square feet fiscal 2005 means the fiscal year ended january 29 2005 fiscal 2006 means the fiscal year ended january 28 2006 fiscal 2007 means the fiscal year ended january 27 2007 and fiscal 2008 means the fiscal year ending january 26 2008 

 

segment overview 

 

marmaxx tj maxx and marshalls 

 

 

marmaxx operates both the tj maxx and marshalls store chains tj maxx is the largest offprice retail chain in the united states with 821 stores in 48 states at fiscal 2007 year end marshalls is the secondlargest offprice retailer in the united states with 734 stores in 42 states as well as 14 stores in puerto rico at that date we maintain the separate identities of the tj maxx and marshalls stores through product assortment and merchandising marketing and store appearance this encourages our customers to shop at both chains 

 

 

tj maxx and marshalls primarily target female shoppers who have families with middle to uppermiddle incomes and who generally fit the profile of a department or specialty store customer these chains operate with a common buying and merchandising organization and have a consolidated administrative function including finance and human resources the combined organization known internally as the marmaxx group offers us increased leverage to purchase merchandise at favorable prices and allows us to operate with a lower cost structure these advantages are key to our ability to sell quality brand name merchandise at substantial discounts from department and specialty store regular prices 

 

 

tj maxx and marshalls sell quality brand name and designer merchandise at prices generally 2060 below department and specialty store regular prices both chains offer family apparel accessories giftware and home 

  fashions within these broad categories tj maxx offers a shoe assortment for women and fine jewelry while marshalls offers a fullline footwear department and a larger men’s department in fiscal 2007 tj maxx substantially completed the roll out of the expanded jewelry and accessories departments to existing stores and marshalls continued to add expanded footwear departments we believe these expanded offerings further differentiate the shopping experience at tj maxx and marshalls driving traffic to both chains we expect to add approximately 200 expanded footwear departments in the marshalls stores in fiscal 2008 and at tj maxx we will continue to add expanded jewelry and accessories departments in new stores relocated stores and selectively to existing stores 

 

 

tj maxx and marshalls stores are generally located in suburban community shopping centers tj maxx stores average approximately 30000 square feet marshalls stores average approximately 32000 square feet we currently expect to add a net of 50 stores in fiscal 2008 ultimately we believe that tj maxx and marshalls together can operate approximately 1800 stores in the united states and puerto rico 

 

homegoods 

 

 

homegoods is our offprice retail chain that sells exclusively home fashions with a broad array of giftware home basics accent furniture lamps rugs accessories children’s furniture and seasonal merchandise for the home many of the homegoods stores are standalone stores however we also combine homegoods stores with a tj maxx or marshalls store in a superstore format the majority of which are dualbranded with both the tj maxx or marshalls logo and the homegoods logo we count the superstores as both a tj maxx or marshalls store and a homegoods store in fiscal 2007 we continued to open a different superstore format called a “combo store” in which a homegoods store is located beside a tj maxx or marshalls store with interior passageways providing access between the stores this configuration is also dualbranded with both the tj maxx or marshalls logo and the homegoods logo 

 

 

standalone homegoods stores average approximately 27000 square feet in superstores which average approximately 53000 square feet we dedicate an average of 22000 square feet to homegoods the 270 stores open at the end of fiscal 2007 include 147 standalone stores 105 superstores and 18 combo stores in fiscal 2008 we plan to net 12 additional stores including 1 superstore we believe that the us market could potentially support approximately 500 to 600 homegoods stores in the long term 

 

winners and homesense 

 

 

winners is the leading offprice retailer in canada offering offprice brand name and designer women’s apparel lingerie accessories home fashions giftware fine jewelry menswear children’s clothing and family footwear winners operates homesense our canadian offprice homefashions chain launched in fiscal 2001 like our homegoods chain homesense offers a wide and rapidly changing assortment of offprice home fashions including giftware accent furniture lamps rugs accessories and seasonal merchandise we operate homesense in a standalone format as well as a superstore format where a homesense store and a winners store are combined or operate sidebyside 

 

 

at fiscal 2007 year end we operated 184 winners stores which averaged approximately 29000 square feet and 68 homesense stores which averaged approximately 24000 square feet we expect to add a net of 4 winners stores and 3 homesense stores in fiscal 2008 in both the standalone and superstore format ultimately we believe the canadian market can support approximately 200 winners stores and approximately 80 homesense stores 

 

tk maxx 

 

 

tk maxx operating in the united kingdom and ireland is the only major offprice retailer in any european country tk maxx utilizes the same offprice strategies employed by tj maxx marshalls and winners and offers the same types of merchandise at the end of fiscal 2007 we operated 210 tk maxx stores which averaged approximately 30000 square feet we expect to add a total of 10 stores in the united kingdom and ireland in fiscal 2008 and believe that the uk and ireland can support approximately 275 stores in the long term in addition in the fall of fiscal 2008 we expect to open 5 tk maxx stores in germany 

 

aj wright 

 

 

aj wright offers our offprice concept to the moderate income customer demographic which differentiates this chain from our other offprice divisions aj wright stores offer brandname family apparel accessories footwear domestics gift ware including toys and games and special opportunistic purchases aj wright stores average approximately 26000 square feet we operated 129 aj wright stores in the united states at fiscal 2007 year end 

  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we identified 34 underperforming stores to close as part of a plan to reposition aj wright for future profitable growth virtually all of these stores were closed at the end of fiscal 2007 the cost to close these stores as well as the operating income or loss of these stores in the current and prior periods has been reported in our financial statements as a discontinued operation in fiscal 2008 we anticipate opening 5 stores in existing markets as we focus on improving performance both in our existing store base and in opening new stores in the long term we believe that the us could potentially support approximately 1000 aj wright stores

  store locations 

 

we operated stores in the following locations as of january 27 2007

  computer intrusion 

 

 

we suffered an unauthorized intrusion into portions of our computer systems that process and store information related to customer transactions that we believe resulted in the theft of customer data we do not know who took this action and whether there were one or more intruders involved we refer to the intruder or intruders collectively as the “intruder” or whether there was one continuing intrusion or multiple separate intrusions we refer to the intrusion or intrusions collectively as the “computer intrusion” we are engaged in an ongoing investigation of the computer intrusion and the information provided in this form 10k is based on the information we have learned in our investigation to the date of this form 10k we do not know what if any additional information we will learn in our investigation but that information could materially add to or change the information provided in this form 10k 

 

 

discovery of computer intrusion on december 18 2006 we learned of suspicious software on our computer systems we immediately initiated an investigation and the next day general dynamics corporation and international business machines corporation leading computer security and incident response firms were engaged to assist in the investigation they determined on december 21 2006 that there was strong reason to believe that our computer systems had been intruded upon and that an intruder remained on our computer systems with the assistance of our investigation team we immediately began to design and implement a plan to monitor and contain the ongoing computer intrusion protect customer data and strengthen the security of our computer systems against the ongoing computer intrusion and possible future attacks 

 

 

on december 22 2006 we notified law enforcement officials of the suspected computer intrusion and later that day met with representatives of the us department of justice us secret service and us attorney boston office to brief them at that meeting the us secret service advised us that disclosure of the suspected computer intrusion might impede their criminal investigation and requested that we maintain the confidentiality of the suspected computer intrusion until law enforcement determined that disclosure would no longer compromise the investigation 

 

 

with the assent of law enforcement on december 26 and december 27 2006 we notified our contracting banks and credit and debit card and check processing companies of the suspected computer intrusion we refer to credit and debit cards as “payment cards” on december 27 2006 we first determined that customer information had apparently been stolen from our computer systems in the computer intrusion on january 3 2007 we together with the us secret service met with our contracting banks and payment card and check processing companies to discuss the computer intrusion 

 

 

prior to the public release of information with respect to the computer intrusion we provided information on the computer intrusion to the us federal trade commission us securities  exchange commission royal canadian mounted police and canadian federal privacy commissioner upon the public release we also provided information to the massachusetts and other state attorneys general california office of privacy protection various canadian provincial privacy commissioners the uk information commissioner and the metropolitan police in london england 

 

 

on january 13 2007 we determined that additional customer information had apparently been stolen from our computer systems 

 

 

on january 17 2007 we publicly announced the computer intrusion and thereafter we expanded our forensic investigation of the computer intrusion 

 

 

on february 18 2007 in the course of our ongoing investigation we found evidence that the computer intrusion may have been initiated earlier than previously reported and that additional customer information potentially had been stolen on february 21 2007 we publicly announced additional findings on the timing and scope of the computer intrusion 

 

 

timing of computer intrusion based on our investigation to date we believe that our computer systems were first accessed by an unauthorized intruder in july 2005 on subsequent dates in 2005 and from midmay 2006 to midjanuary 2007 but that no customer data were stolen after december 18 2006 

 

 

systems affected in the computer intrusion we believe that information was stolen in the computer intrusion from a portion of our computer systems in framingham ma that processes and stores information related to payment card check and unreceipted merchandise return transactions for customers of our tj maxx marshalls homegoods and aj wright stores in the us and puerto rico and our winners and homesense stores in canada “framingham 

  system” and from a portion of our computer systems in watford uk that processes and stores information related to payment card transactions at tk maxx in the united kingdom and ireland “watford system” we do not believe that the computer intrusion affected the portions of our computer systems handling transactions for customers of bob’s stores or check and merchandise return transactions at tk maxx we do not believe that customer personal identification numbers pins were compromised because before storage on the framingham system they are separately encrypted in us puerto rican and canadian stores at the pin pad and because we do not store pins on the watford system we do not believe that information from transactions using debit cards issued by canadian banks at winners and homesense that were transacted through the interac network was compromised although we believe that information from transactions at our us stores other than bob’s stores using canadian debit cards that were transacted through the nyce network were processed and stored on the framingham system we do not believe the pins required to use these canadian debit cards were compromised in the computer intrusion we do not process or store names or addresses on the framingham system in connection with payment card or check transactions 

 

 

customer information believed stolen we have sought to identify customer information stolen in the computer intrusion to date we have been able to identify only some of the information that we believe was stolen prior to discovery of the computer intrusion we deleted in the ordinary course of business the contents of many files that we now believe were stolen in addition the technology used by the intruder has to date made it impossible for us to determine the contents of most of the files we believe were stolen in 2006 given the scale and geographic scope of our business and computer systems and the time frames involved in the computer intrusion our investigation has required a substantial period of time to date and is not completed we are continuing to try to identify information stolen in the computer intrusion through our investigation but other than the information provided below we believe that we may never be able to identify much of the information believed stolen 

 

 

based on our investigation we have been able to determine some details about information processed and stored on the framingham system and the watford system customer names and addresses were not included with the payment card data believed stolen for any period because we do not process or store that information on the framingham system or watford system in connection with payment card transactions in addition for transactions after september 2 2003 we generally no longer stored on our framingham system the security data included in the magnetic stripe on payment cards required for card present transactions “track 2” data because those data generally were masked meaning permanently deleted and replaced with asterisks also by april 3 2006 our framingham system generally also masked payment card pins some other portions of payment card transaction information and some portions of check transaction information for transactions after april 7 2004 our framingham system also generally began encrypting meaning substituted characters for the actual characters using an encryption algorithm provided by our software vendor all payment card and check transaction information with respect to the watford system masking and encryption practices were generally implemented at various points in time for various portions of the payment card data 

 

 

until discovery of the computer intrusion we stored certain customer personal information on our framingham system that we received in connection with returns of merchandise without receipts and in some check transactions in our us puerto rican and canadian stores other than bob’s stores in some cases this personal information included drivers’ license military and state identification numbers referred to as “personal id numbers” together with related names and addresses and in some of those cases we believe those personal id numbers were the same as the customers’ social security numbers after april 7 2004 we generally encrypted this personal information when stored on our framingham system we do not process or store information relating to check or merchandise return transactions or customer personal information on the watford system 

 

 

information believed stolen in 2005 as we previously publicly reported we believe customer data were stolen in september and november 2005 relating to a portion of the payment card transactions made at our stores in the us puerto rico and canada excluding transactions at bob’s stores and transactions made at winners and homesense through the interac network with debit cards issued by canadian banks during the period from december 31 2002 through june 28 2004 we suspect the data believed stolen in 2005 related to somewhere between approximately half to substantially all of the transactions at us puerto rican and canadian stores during the period from december 31 2002 through june 28 2004 excluding transactions at bob’s stores and transactions made at winners and homesense through the interac network with debit cards issued by canadian banks the data were included in files routinely created on our framingham system to store customer data but the contents of many of the files were deleted in the ordinary course of business prior to discovery of the computer intrusion through our investigation to date we have 

  identified the information set forth in the following chart with respect to the approximate number of payment cards for which information is believed to have been stolen in this period 

 

 

 

  

 

customer names and addresses and for transactions after september 2 2003 track 2 data were not included in the payment card information believed stolen in 2005 we do not believe that customer pins were compromised 

 

 

in addition we believe that personal information provided in connection with a portion of the unreceipted merchandise return transactions at tj maxx marshalls and homegoods stores in the us and puerto rico primarily during the last four months of 2003 and may and june 2004 was also stolen in 2005 the information we are able to specifically identify was from 2003 and included personal id numbers together with the related names andor addresses of approximately 451000 individuals we are in the process of notifying these individuals directly by letter 

 

 

information believed stolen in 2006 as previously publicly reported we identified a limited number of payment cards as to which transaction information was included in the customer data that we believe were stolen in 2006 this information was contained in two files apparently created in connection with computer systems problems in 2004 and 2006 through our investigation to date we have identified the following information with respect to the approximate number of payment cards for which unencrypted information was included in these files 

 

 

 

 

customer names and addresses were not included with the payment card information in these files we do not believe that customer pins were compromised some of the payment card data contained in these files were encrypted we have not sought to decrypt these data 

 

 

in addition the two files contained the personal id numbers together with the related names andor addresses of approximately 3600 individuals and we sent notice directly to these individuals 

 

 

we also have located a third file created in the ordinary course that we believe was stolen by the intruder in 2006 and that we believe contained customer data all of the data in this file are encrypted and we have not sought to decrypt them 

 

 

as previously publicly reported we believe that in 2006 the intruder may also have stolen from our framingham system additional payment card check and unreceipted merchandise return information for transactions made in our stores in the us canada and puerto rico excluding transactions at bob’s stores and transactions made at winners and homesense through the interac network with debit cards issued by canadian banks during portions of midmay through december 18 2006 through our investigation we have identified approximately 100 files that we believe the intruder during this period stole from our framingham system the vast majority of which we believe the intruder created and that we suspect included customer data however due to the technology utilized by the intruder we are unable to determine the nature or extent of information included in these files despite our masking and encryption practices on our framingham system in 2006 the technology utilized in the computer intrusion during 2006 could have enabled the intruder to steal payment card data from our framingham system during the payment card issuer’s approval process in which data including the track 2 data is transmitted to payment card issuer’s without encryption further we believe that the intruder had access to the decryption tool for the encryption software utilized by tjx the 

  approximately 100 files stolen in 2006 could have included the data that we believe were stolen in 2005 as well as other data relative to some customer transactions from december 31 2002 through midmay 2006 although with respect to transactions after september 2 2003 generally without track 2 data and with respect to transactions after april 7 2004 generally with all data encrypted 

 

 

in addition as previously publicly reported we suspect that customer data for payment card transactions at tk maxx stores in the uk and ireland has been stolen in that regard we now believe that at least two files of the approximately 100 files identified above that the intruder stole from the framingham system in 2006 were created by the intruder and moved from the watford system to the framingham system we suspect that these files contained payment card transaction data some or all of which could have been unencrypted and unmasked however due to the technology utilized by the intruder in the computer intrusion we are unable to determine the nature or extent of information included in these files further the technology utilized by the intruder in the computer intrusion during 2006 on the watford system could also have enabled the intruder to steal payment card data from the watford system during the payment card issuer’s approval process in which data including the track 2 data are transmitted to payment card issuer’s without encryption 

 

 

we have provided extensive payment card transaction information to the banks and payment card companies with which we contract as requested by them while we have been advised by law enforcement authorities that they are investigating fraudulent use of payment card information believed stolen from tjx we do not know the extent of any fraudulent use of such information some banks and payment card companies have advised us that they have found what they consider to be preliminary evidence of possible fraudulent use of payment card information that may have been stolen from us but they have not shared with us the details of their preliminary findings we also do not know the extent of any fraudulent use of any of the personal information believed stolen certain banks have sought and other banks and payment card companies may seek either directly against us or through claims against our acquiring banks as to which we may have an indemnity obligation payment of or reimbursement for fraudulent card charges and operating expenses such as costs of replacing andor monitoring payment cards thought by them to have been placed at risk by the computer intrusion that they believe they have incurred by reason of the computer intrusion in addition payment card companies and associations may seek to impose fines by reason of the computer intrusion 

 

 

financial costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded a pretax charge of approximately 5 million or 01 per share for costs incurred through the fourth quarter in connection with the computer intrusion which includes costs incurred to investigate and contain the computer intrusion strengthen computer security and systems and communicate with customers as well as technical legal and other fees beyond this charge we do not have enough information to reasonably estimate losses we may incur arising from the computer intrusion various litigation has been or may be filed and various claims have been or may be otherwise asserted against us andor our acquiring banks on behalf of customers banks andor card companies seeking damages allegedly arising out of the computer intrusion and other related relief we intend to defend such litigation and claims vigorously although we cannot predict the outcome of such litigation and claims various governmental entities are investigating the computer intrusion and although we are cooperating in such investigations we may be subject to fines or other obligations see item 3 with respect to litigation and investigations losses that we may incur as a result of the computer intrusion include losses arising out of claims by payment card associations and banks customers shareholders governmental entities and others technical legal computer systems and other expenses and other potential liabilities costs and expenses such losses could be material to our results of operation and financial condition 

 

 

future actions we are continuing our forensic investigation of the computer intrusion and our ongoing program to strengthen and protect our computer systems we are continuing to communicate with our customers about the computer intrusion we are continuing to cooperate with law enforcement in its investigation of these crimes and with the payment card companies and associations and our acquiring banks we are also continuing to cooperate with governmental agencies in their investigations of the computer intrusion we are vigorously defending the litigation and claims asserted against us with respect to the computer intrusion

our revenue growth could be adversely affected if we do not continue to expand our operations successfully 

 

 

we have steadily expanded the number of chains and stores we operate and our selling square footage our revenue growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand successfully through new store openings as well as our ability to increase same store sales successful store growth requires selection of store locations in appropriate geographies availability of attractive stores or store sites in such locations and negotiation of acceptable terms competition for desirable sites and increases in real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities even if we succeed in opening new stores these new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores further expansion places demands upon us to manage rapid growth and we may not do so successfully 

 

our quarterly operating results can be subject to significant fluctuations and may fall short of either a prior quarter or investors’ expectations 

 

 

our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future our earnings may not continue to grow at rates similar to the growth rates achieved in recent years and may fall short of either a prior quarter or investors’ expectations factors that could cause these quarterly fluctuations include some factors that are within our control such as the execution of our offprice buying selection pricing flow and mix of merchandise and inventory management including markon and markdowns and some factors that are not within our control including actions of competitors weather conditions economic conditions and consumer confidence and seasonality in addition if we do not repurchase or are unable to repurchase the number of shares we contemplate pursuant to our stock repurchase program our earnings per share may be adversely affected most of our operating expenses such as rent expense and associate salaries do not vary directly with the amount of sales and are difficult to adjust in the short term as a result if sales in a particular quarter are below expectations for that quarter we may not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter and therefore such a sales shortfall would have a disproportionate effect on our net income for the quarter we maintain a forecasting process that seeks to project sales and align expenses if management fails to correctly forecast changes or appropriately adjust the business plan in light of results our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 

we may have difficulty extending our offprice model in new product lines chains and geographic regions 

 

 

we have expanded our original offprice model into different product lines chains geographic areas and countries our growth is dependent upon our ability to successfully execute our offprice retail apparel and home fashions concepts in new markets and geographic regions if we are unable to successfully execute our concepts in these 

  new markets and regions or if consumers there are not receptive to the concepts our financial performance could be adversely affected 

 

if we fail to execute our opportunistic buying and inventory management well our business could be adversely affected 

 

 

we purchase the majority of our inventory opportunistically with our buyers purchasing close to need to drive traffic to the stores and to increase same store sales the treasure hunt nature of the offprice buying experience requires continued replenishment of fresh high quality attractively priced merchandise while opportunistic buying enables our buyers to buy at the right time and price in the quantities we need and into market trends it places considerable discretion in our buyers subjecting us to risks on the timing quantity and nature of inventory flowing to the stores we rely on our expansive distribution infrastructure to support delivering goods to our stores on time we must effectively and timely distribute inventory to stores maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory and effectively manage pricing and markdowns failure to acquire and manage our inventory well and to operate our distribution infrastructure effectively could adversely affect our performance and our relationship with our customers 

 

our success depends upon our marketing advertising and promotional efforts if we are unable to implement them successfully or if our competitors are more effective than we are our revenue may be adversely affected 

 

 

we use marketing and promotional programs to attract customers to our stores and to encourage purchases by our customers we use various media for our promotional efforts including print television database marketing and direct marketing if we fail to choose the appropriate medium for our efforts or fail to implement and execute new marketing opportunities our competitors may be able to attract some of our customers and cause them to decrease purchases in our stores and increase purchases elsewhere which might negatively impact our revenues changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity or merchandising strategy by our competitors could cause us to have difficulties in retaining existing customers and attracting new customers 

 

we have expended and expect to expend significant time and money as a result of the computer intrusion we suffered and as a result of the computer intrusion we could incur material losses and our reputation and business could be materially harmed 

 

 

we suffered the computer intrusion in which we believe that customer data were stolen we are conducting an investigation of the computer intrusion to date we have been able to identify only some of the information that we believe was stolen deletions in the ordinary course of business prior to discovery of the computer intrusion and the technology used by the intruder have to date made it impossible for us to determine much of the information we believe was stolen and we believe that we may never be able to identify much of that information further we cannot predict whether we will learn information in addition to or different from the information that we now believe about the computer intrusion and the data believed stolen 

 

 

while we have been advised by law enforcement authorities that they are investigating fraudulent use of payment card information believed stolen from tjx we do not know the extent of any fraudulent use of such information some banks and payment card companies have advised us that they have found what they consider to be preliminary evidence of possible fraudulent use of credit payment card information that may have been stolen from us but they have not shared with us the details of their preliminary findings we also do not know the extent of any fraudulent use of any of the personal information believed stolen there could be significant fraudulent use of the information believed stolen from us 

 

 

we have incurred capital and other costs to investigate and contain the computer intrusion strengthen our computer security and systems and communicate with customers as well as legal technical and other fees and we expect to continue to incur significant costs for these purposes certain banks have sought and other banks and payment card companies may seek either directly against us or through claims against our acquiring banks as to which we may have an indemnity obligation payment of or reimbursement for fraudulent card charges and operating expenses such as costs of replacing andor monitoring payment cards thought by them to have been placed at risk by the computer intrusion that they believe they have incurred by reason of the computer intrusion in addition payment card companies and associations may seek to impose fines by reason of the computer intrusion 

 

 

various litigation has been or may be filed and various claims have been or may be otherwise asserted against us andor our acquiring banks for which we may be responsible on behalf of customers banks payment card companies 

  and shareholders seeking damages allegedly arising out of the computer intrusion and other related relief we intend to defend such litigation and claims vigorously although we cannot predict the outcome of such litigation and claims various governmental entities are investigating the computer intrusion and although we are cooperating in such investigations we may be subject to fines or other obligations we cannot predict what actions such governmental entities will take and what the consequences will be for us the ultimate resolution of such litigation claims and investigations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition regardless of the merits and ultimate outcome of these matters litigation and proceedings of this type are expensive to respond to and defend and we could devote substantial resources and time to responding to and defending them 

 

 

beyond the charge we took in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we do not have enough information to reasonably estimate losses we may incur arising from the computer intrusion these losses may include losses arising out of claims by payment card companies and banks customers shareholders and governmental entities technical legal computer system and other expenses and other potential liabilities costs and expenses such losses could be material to our results of operations and financial condition further the publicity associated with the computer intrusion could materially harm our business and relationships with customers 

 

 

since discovering the computer intrusion we have taken steps designed to strengthen the security of our computer systems and protocols and have instituted an ongoing program to continue to do so nevertheless there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a future data compromise we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential customer information such as payment card and personal information we believe that the intruder had access to the decryption algorithm for the encryption software we utilize further the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves all of which can put payment card data at risk are determined and controlled by the payment card industry not by us improper activities by third parties advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology new tools and discoveries and other events or developments may facilitate or result in a further compromise or breach of our computer systems any such further compromises or breaches could cause interruptions in our operations damage to our reputation and customers’ willingness to shop in our stores and subject us to additional costs and liabilities 

 

our business is subject to seasonal influences and a decrease in sales or margins during the second half of the year could adversely affect our operating results 

 

 

our business is subject to seasonal influences we realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the year any decrease in sales or margins during this period could have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

if we fail to anticipate consumer trends and preferences our performance could suffer 

 

 

because our success depends on our ability to keep up with consumer trends we take steps to address the risk that we will fail to anticipate consumer preferences these include for example maintaining extensive contacts with vendors with other retailers as appropriate and with the national retail federation comparison shopping and monitoring fashion trends our buying departments and individual buyers monitor consumer trends and preferences in their respective product categories and areas we focus on the demographics associated with the customer bases of our divisions and we monitor such demographics in locating new and remodeled stores nonetheless we still face the risk that we will fail to effectively anticipate consumer trends and preferences which failure could adversely affect our operating results 

 

we experience risks associated with our substantial size and scale 

 

 

we operate eight store chains in several countries some aspects of the businesses and operations of the chains are conducted with relative autonomy the large size of our operations our multiple businesses and the autonomy afforded to the chains increase the risk that systems and practices will not be implemented uniformly throughout our company and that information will not be appropriately shared across different chains and countries 

 

unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate could adversely affect our operating results 

 

 

customers’ willingness to shop and their demand for the merchandise in our stores are affected by adverse and unseasonable weather frequent or unusually heavy snow ice or rain storms natural disasters severe cold or heat or 

  extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets could adversely affect our sales and increase markdowns 

 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

 

 

the retail business is highly competitive we compete for customers associates locations merchandise services and other important aspects of our business with many other local regional and national retailers we also face competition from alternative retail distribution channels such as catalogues media and internet sites changes in the merchandising pricing and promotional activities of those competitors and in the retail industry generally may adversely affect our performance 

 

if we do not attract and retain quality sales distribution center and other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel our performance could be adversely affected 

 

 

our performance is dependent on recruiting developing training and retaining quality sales distribution center and other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel many of our associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover the nature of the workforce in the retail industry subjects us to the risk of immigration law violations our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates minimum wage legislation and changing demographics in the event of increasing wage rates if we do not increase our wages competitively our customer service could suffer because of a declining quality of our workforce or our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates in addition certain associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions further our offprice model limits the market for experienced buying and management personnel and requires us to do significant internal training and development changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates and management personnel could adversely affect our performance 

 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions of new businesses or divest any of our current businesses our business will be subject to additional risks 

 

 

we have grown our business through mergers and acquisitions integrating new stores and concepts can be a difficult task we may consider attractive opportunities to acquire new businesses or to divest any of our current business segments acquisition or divestiture activities may divert attention of our executive management team away from the existing businesses we may do a less than optimal job of due diligence or evaluation of target companies divestiture also involves risks such as the risk of future exposure on lease obligations failure to execute on mergers or divestitures in a satisfactory manner could have an adverse effect on our future business prospects or our financial performance in the future 

 

if we are unable to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively our business could be disrupted or our sales or profitability could be reduced 

 

 

the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and to successfully implement new technologies systems controls and adequate disaster recovery systems in addition we must protect the confidentiality of our and our customers’ data the failure of tjx’s information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm our profitability see also the risk factor above entitled “ we have expended and expect to expend significant time and money as a result of the computer intrusion we suffered and as a result of the computer intrusion we could incur material losses and our reputation and business could be materially harmed ” 

 

we depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to support new capital expansion operations debt repayment and stock repurchase program 

 

 

our business is dependent upon our operations generating strong cash flows to support our capital expansion requirements our general operating activities and our stock repurchase programs and to fund debt repayment and the availability of financing sources our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of availability of financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms could adversely affect our financial performance or our earnings per share growth 

  consumer spending is adversely affected by general economic and other factors which are beyond our control and could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

 

 

interest rates recession inflation deflation consumer credit availability consumer debt levels energy costs tax rates and policy unemployment trends threats or possibilities of war terrorism or other global or national unrest actual or threatened epidemics political or financial instability and general economic and other factors have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending which in turn affect sales at tjx and other retailers these factors are beyond our control and could adversely affect our sales and performance 

 

we are subject to import risks 

 

 

many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a limited extent by us in many foreign countries imported merchandise is subject to various risks including potential disruptions in supply changes in duties tariffs quotas and voluntary export restrictions on imported merchandise strikes and other events affecting delivery and economic political or other problems in countries from or through which merchandise is imported political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to international trade and imported merchandise are beyond our control and could affect the availability and the price of our inventory 

 

our expanding international operations expose us to risks inherent in foreign operations 

 

 

we have a significant presence in canada the united kingdom and ireland and have plans to expand into germany in fiscal 2008 we may also seek to expand into other international markets in the future our foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by our us operations as well as risks inherent in foreign operations such as understanding the retail climate and trends local customs and competitive conditions in foreign markets complying with foreign laws rules and regulations and foreign currency fluctuations which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 

 

changes in laws and regulations and accounting rules and principles could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

 

 

various aspects of our operations are subject to federal state or local laws rules and regulations any of which may change from time to time generally accepted accounting principles may change from time to time as well regulatory developments and changes in accounting rules and principles could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance 

 

we maintain internal controls over financial reporting but they cannot provide absolute assurance that there will not be material errors in our financial reporting 

 

 

we maintain a system of internal controls over financial reporting but there are limitations inherent in internal control systems if we are unable to maintain adequate and effective internal control over financial reporting our financial performance could be adversely affected a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be appropriate relative to their costs

government investigations a number of government agencies are conducting investigations as to whether tjx as a result of the computer intrusion may have violated laws regarding consumer protection and related matters tjx has been advised that the attorney general of the commonwealth of massachusetts is leading an investigation into the computer intrusion on behalf of a multistate group of state attorneys general the “multistate group” which as initially comprised had approximately 30 participating states in march 2007 the company received a civil investigative demand “cid” from the massachusetts attorney general’s office seeking documents concerning the computer intrusion as part of that office’s review of allegations that the company may have violated state law regarding consumer protection and related matters the company also received nearly identical demands in march 2007 from eight other state attorneys general that are participating in the multistate group these demands include a cid from the attorney general of the state of arkansas a cid from the attorney general of the state of illinois a subpoena from the attorney general of the state of new jersey a subpoena from the state of ohio a cid from the state of oregon department of justice a subpoena from the attorney general of the commonwealth of pennsylvania a request for consumer protection information “request” from the attorney general of the state of tennessee which had issued an earlier request in january 2007 and a subpoena from the attorney general of the state of vermont tjx has been advised that the attorneys general of two other states participating in the multistate group may also issue their own demands which if issued are expected to be substantively identical to the other demands tjx has received 

 

 

in addition to these demands the company also has received a number of other inquiries requests and demands from state attorneys general for information relating to the computer intrusion most shortly after tjx announced the computer intrusion publicly and before the multistate group commenced its investigation including a request by the attorney general of the state of connecticut that the company voluntarily provide written answers to various questions relating to the computer intrusion a cid from the secretary of the state of rhode island and verbal requests for information from various other state attorneys general

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

 

the following discussion contains forwardlooking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements due to various factors including those discussed in item 1a of this report under the section entitled “risk factors” 

 

 

the discussion that follows relates to our fiscal years ended january 27 2007 fiscal 2007 january 28 2006 fiscal 2006 and january 29 2005 fiscal 2005 

 

 

in november 2006 we decided to close 34 aj wright stores as part of a repositioning of the chain the following discussion focuses on our results from continuing operations which excludes the results of these 34 aj wright stores the cost to close these stores was recorded as a discontinued operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and the operating income or loss from these stores is also presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented the closings resulted in an after tax charge of 38 million or 008 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and is discussed in more detail in note c to the consolidated financial statements and below within the aj wright discussion under “segment information” 

 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we discovered that we had suffered an unauthorized intrusion into the portion of our computer systems that processes and stores information related to customer transactions we do not know who took this action whether there were one or more intruders involved or whether there was one continuing intrusion or multiple separate intrusions we refer to the intrusion or intrusions collectively as the “computer intrusion” we have been engaged in an ongoing investigation of the computer intrusion and computer security and incident response experts have been engaged to assist in the investigation we believe customer data was stolen in the computer intrusion in 2005 and 2006 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded a pretax charge of approximately 5 million or 001 per share for costs incurred through the fourth quarter in connection with the computer intrusion which includes costs incurred to investigate and contain the computer intrusion enhance computer security and systems and communicate with customers as well as technical legal and other fees beyond this charge we do not yet have enough information to reasonably estimate losses we may incur arising from the computer intrusion such losses could be material to our results of operations and financial condition for more information see item 1business under the caption “computer intrusion” note b to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion below under the caption “potential liabilities in connection with computer intrusion” 

 

results of operations 

 

fiscal 2007 overview 

 

 25 

    

 

  

 

we believe this presentation reflects our results on a more comparable basis and is useful in understanding the underlying trends in our business 

 

  

 

the following is a summary of the operating results of tjx at the consolidated level this discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment all references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share from continuing operations unless otherwise indicated all prior periods have been adjusted to reclassify the operating results of the aj wright store closings to discontinued operations see note c to our consolidated financial statements 

 

 

net sales net sales for fiscal 2007 totaled 174 billion a 9 increase over net sales of 160 billion in fiscal 2006 net sales for fiscal 2006 increased 7 over net sales of 149 billion for fiscal 2005 

 

 

the 9 increase in net sales for fiscal 2007 includes a 5 increase attributable to new stores and a 4 increase in same store sales the 7 increase in net sales for fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 reflects 5 from new stores and 2 from same store sales 

 

 

new stores are a major source of sales growth our consolidated store count increased by 4 in fiscal 2007 and 7 in fiscal 2006 over the respective prior year periods and our selling square footage increased by 4 in fiscal 2007 and 8 

  in fiscal 2006 in each case without adjustment for the aj wright closed stores excluding the impact of the aj wright store closings in fiscal 2007 our consolidated store count and total selling square footage each increased by 5 in fiscal 2007 we expect to add 83 stores net of store closings in the fiscal year ending january 26 2008 fiscal 2008 a 3 projected increase in our consolidated store base and we expect to increase our selling square footage base by 4 

 

 

the 4 increase in same store sales for fiscal 2007 was driven by growth in unit sales and increased transactions as well as the strong performance at our international businesses winners’ same store sales increased 5 and tk maxx same store sales increased 9 both in local currency net sales for fiscal 2007 reflect growth in both apparel and home fashions within apparel jewelry accessories and footwear combined as well as misses sportswear and dresses performed well as for home fashions giftware and home decorative products performed well while our “soft” home categories bedding linens etc were weak same store sales also benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments in marshalls during fiscal 2007 we added 134 expanded footwear departments bringing the total number of stores with the expanded footwear departments to 280 these stores had same store sales growth that exceeded the chain average during fiscal 2008 we intend to expand footwear departments in approximately 200 additional marshalls stores the expansion of jewelry and accessory departments at tj maxx was substantially completed during fiscal 2007 with 686 out of the total 821 stores having expanded departments as of year end going forward we plan to add jewelry and accessory expansions to certain new stores and relocated stores as well as a limited number of existing stores in the united states where tjx generates approximately 80 of its sales same store sales increased across almost all regions with the northeast southwest and midatlantic areas experiencing the strongest growth same store sales growth was favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates which contributed approximately one percentage point of growth 

 

 

net sales for fiscal 2006 reflected strong demand for jewelry accessories and footwear as well as improved demand for men’s apparel the positive impact of growth in these categories was partially offset by same store sales declines in home fashions and women’s sportswear marmaxx continued its program of expanding jewelry and accessories and footwear departments and ended fiscal 2006 with 594 tj maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 146 marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments these stores had same store sales growth which exceeded marmaxx’s chain average in the united states same store sales were strong in warm weather regions particularly florida the southwest and california while flat to slightly negative in the midwest and northeast same store sales growth was favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates which contributed approximately onehalf of a percentage point of growth 

 

 

we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the same store percentage is immaterial consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in us dollars we also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of the divisional operating performance 

 

 

the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales 

 

 

   

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 759 in fiscal 2007 766 in fiscal 2006 and 764 in fiscal 2005 this ratio for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 reflects an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin 04 percentage points as well as expense leverage due to our cost containment initiatives and the impact of strong same store sales growth these improvements in the fiscal 2007 expense ratio were partially offset by increases in some operating costs as a percentage of net sales primarily occupancy costs 02 percentage points 

 

 

cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2006 as compared with fiscal 2005 reflects an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin of 05 percentage points the improvement in merchandise margin was largely due to lower markdowns at our smaller divisions partially offset by an increase in fuel related freight costs in addition the comparison to the fiscal 2005 expense ratio was favorably impacted by a 307 million noncash charge 193 million aftertax in fiscal 2005 to conform our lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting principles see note a to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “lease accounting” this charge was included in cost of sales in fiscal 2005 and increased that year’s expense ratio by 02 percentage points these improvements in the fiscal 2006 expense ratio were more than offset by increases in operating costs as a percentage of net sales primarily occupancy costs which reflect the delevering impact of a 2 same store sales growth as well as higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than marmaxx which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

 

 

selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 168 in fiscal 2007 169 in fiscal 2006 and 167 in fiscal 2005 the 01 percentage point decrease in fiscal 2007 reflects expense leverage across most categories partially offset by a planned increase in marketing expense 01 percentage point the increase in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 reflects an increase in store payroll costs as a percentage of net sales reflecting the delevering impact of the low singledigit same store sales increase the increase in this ratio for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was also negatively affected by the net impact of third quarter events including the costs of the executive resignation agreements ecommerce exit and hurricane related costs offset in part by a visamastercard antitrust litigation settlement 

 

 

interest expense net interest expense net of interest income was 156 million for fiscal 2007 296 million in fiscal 2006 and 258 million in fiscal 2005 interest income was 236 million in fiscal 2007 94 million in fiscal 2006 and 77 million in fiscal 2005 the decrease in net interest expense in fiscal 2007 was due to the increase in interest income the increase in interest income in fiscal 2007 was driven by higher cash balances and higher rates of return on short term investments the increase in net interest expense in fiscal 2006 was due to higher shortterm borrowings and interest rates the higher borrowing levels were primarily driven by the timing of inventory purchases capital expenditures and repurchase of the company’s common stock the additional interest expense from shortterm borrowings was partially offset by reduced interest costs due to the repayment of 100 million of 7 unsecured notes in june 2005 as well as an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates 

 

 

income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was 377 in fiscal 2007 316 in fiscal 2006 and 383 in fiscal 2005 the increase in the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate reflected the absence of onetime tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 described in more detail below which favorably impacted the fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate by 68 percentage points the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate benefited through july 20 2006 from the tax treatment of foreign currency gains and losses on certain intercompany loans between winners and tjx this tax treatment reduced the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate by 02 percentage points effective july 20 2006 we redesignated one of these intercompany loans and the related hedge as a net investment in our foreign operations and gains and losses on these items after july 20 2006 are recorded in other comprehensive income net of tax effects in addition the fiscal 2007 effective income tax rate was favorably impacted by increased income at our foreign operations a portion of which are taxed at a lower rate than our domestic operations as well as settlement of a state tax assessment for less than the related reserves combined these two items reduced the effective income tax rate by 06 percentage points as compared to fiscal 2006 

 

 

the tax provision for fiscal 2006 includes a fourth quarter benefit of 47 million due to the repatriation of earnings from our canadian subsidiary in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we corrected our accounting for the tax impact of foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans we previously established a deferred tax liability on these gains which are not taxable the impact of correcting for the tax treatment of these gains resulted in a tax benefit of 22 million or 004 per share in fiscal 2006 the cumulative impact of this adjustment through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 was 182 million all of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 

  fiscal 2006 of the 182 million 101 million related to fiscal 2005 these two items collectively reduced the fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate by 68 percentage points see note i to the consolidated financial statements 

 

 

income from continuing operations income from continuing operations was 7768 million in fiscal 2007 6898 million in fiscal 2006 and 6102 million in fiscal 2005 income from continuing operations per share was 163 in fiscal 2007 141 in fiscal 2006 and 121 in fiscal 2005 unlike many companies in the retail industry tjx did not have a 53rd week in fiscal 2007 but will have a 53rd week in fiscal 2009 

 

 

income from continuing operations for fiscal 2007 was adversely impacted by an aftertax charge relating to the computer intrusion of approximately 3 million which reduced fourth quarter earnings per share by 001 per share income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of 47 million or 010 per share due to the repatriation of foreign earnings as well as a tax benefit of 22 million or 004 per share relating to the correction of a previously established deferred tax liability favorable changes in currency exchange rates added approximately 003 to our earnings per share in fiscal 2007 and approximately 001 per share in fiscal 2006 

 

 

income from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was adversely impacted by approximately 12 million or 002 per share due to the third quarter events these third quarter events included the aftertax cost of executive resignation agreements primarily with respect to our former ceo 5 million ecommerce exit costs and third quarter operating losses 6 million and uninsured losses due to third quarter hurricanes including the estimated impact of lost sales 6 million all of which were partially offset by a gain from a visamastercard antitrust litigation settlement 5 million operating losses of the ecommerce operation in the first six months of fiscal 2006 were largely offset by fiscal 2005 start up costs and a fourth quarter operating loss in fiscal 2005 

 

 

income from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 was reduced by 193 million or 004 per share as a result of the aftertax effect of the 307 million cumulative pretax noncash charge to conform our lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting principles see note a to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “lease accounting” lastly favorable changes in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2005 added approximately 002 to our earnings per share 

 

 

the change in earnings per share from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was favorably impacted by our share repurchase program during fiscal 2007 we repurchased 220 million shares of our stock at a cost of 557 million which was less than planned as we temporarily suspended our buyback activity in december 2006 as a result of the discovery and investigation of the computer intrusion in fiscal 2006 we repurchased 259 million shares at a cost of 600 million in january 2007 our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to 1 billion of tjx common stock from time to time which is in addition to the 436 million remaining in the existing plan we plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2008 with planned purchases of approximately 900 million 

 

 

fourth quarter results fourth quarter income from continuing operations was 243 million or 051 per share in fiscal 2007 287 million or 059 per share in fiscal 2006 and 165 million or 033 per share in fiscal 2005 results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 were impacted by certain charges and onetime items that affect the comparability of reported results the chart below shows the effect of these items on fourth quarter income from continuing operations and earnings per share 

 

 

 

 

we believe this presentation reflects our results on a more comparable basis and is useful in understanding the underlying trends in our business 

   

excluding these charges and onetime items from fiscal 2006 the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter income from continuing operations of 243 million increased 11 and earnings per share of 051 increased 13 pretax profit margin was 75 in both fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 pretax margin improved on the strength of strong samestore sales at winners tk maxx and homegoods resulting in expense leverage across most categories this improvement in the pretax margin was offset by costs related to the computer intrusion 01 percentage point a planned increase in advertising expense 02 percentage points and an increase in occupancy costs at tk maxx 01 percentage point as well as the year over year decline in aj wright’s and bob’s stores’ segment profit margins 

 

 

discontinued operations and net income our results from continuing operations exclude the results of operations and the cost of closing 34 aj wright stores see “segment information — aj wright” below and note c to the consolidated financial statements for more information net income which includes the impact of discontinued operations was 738 million or 155 per share for fiscal 2007 690 million or 141 per share for fiscal 2006 and 610 million or 121 per share in fiscal 2005 

 

 

segment information the following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments we consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income before general corporate expense and interest “segment profit or loss” as we define the term may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities in addition this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity more detailed information about our segments including a reconciliation of “segment profit or loss” to “income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes” can be found in note o to the consolidated financial statements presented below is selected financial information related to our business segments us dollars in millions

marmaxx 

 

 

 

 

marmaxx posted a 2 same store sales increase in fiscal 2007 consistent with the prior year both apparel and home fashions reported same store sales growth in fiscal 2007 with apparel performing slightly better than home fashions same store sales of jewelry and accessories and footwear combined as well as misses sportswear and dresses were above the chain average same store sales also benefited from the continued expansion of footwear departments in marshalls during fiscal 2007 we added 134 expanded footwear departments bringing the total number of expanded footwear stores to 280 during fiscal 2008 we intend to expand footwear departments in approximately 200 additional marshalls stores the expansion of jewelry and accessory departments at tj maxx was substantially completed during fiscal 2007 with 686 out of the total 821 stores having expanded departments as of year end going forward we will add jewelry and accessory expansions to certain new stores and relocated stores as well as a limited number of existing stores geographically in fiscal 2007 regions that performed above the chain average were the southwest northeast and midatlantic 

 

 

segment profit as a percentage of net sales “segment margin” increased to 94 in fiscal 2007 from 90 in fiscal 2006 the increase in the fiscal 2007 segment margin was largely driven by 02 percentage point improvement in merchandise margin primarily due to lower markdowns and expense leverage across most categories due to our cost containment initiatives additionally fiscal 2007 includes the favorable impact on current year casualty insurance and employee medical costs due to favorable claims experience these improvements in segment margin were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs 02 percentage points and a planned increased in marketing costs 01 percentage point as of january 27 2007 average inventories per store were up 8 compared to a 10 decline at the prior year end the increase at fiscal 2007 year end was primarily due to our instock position on spring transitional goods and 

  an increase in average ticket the decline at the prior year end was largely due to lower levels of inventory in our distribution centers 

 

 

segment margin decreased to 90 in fiscal 2006 from 94 in fiscal 2005 the decline in the fiscal 2006 segment margin was largely driven by the delevering impact of a 2 same store sales increase which impacted operating expense ratios primarily occupancy costs which increased 03 percentage points and distribution center costs which increased 01 percentage point in addition certain of the third quarter events described above ecommerce and hurricane related losses offset in part by the gain from the visamastercard settlement reduced segment margin in fiscal 2006 by 01 percentage point the comparison to the fiscal 2005 margin was favorably impacted by the inclusion in fiscal 2005’s segment profit of a 168 million charge for the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment which reduced fiscal 2005 segment profit margin by 02 percentage points merchandise margin for fiscal 2006 was essentially flat compared to fiscal 2005 despite fuel related increases in freight costs 

 

 

we added a net of 55 new stores tj maxx or marshalls in fiscal 2007 and increased total selling square footage of the division by 4 we expect to open 50 new stores net of closings in fiscal 2008 increasing the marmaxx store base by 3 and increasing its selling square footage by 3 

 

winners and homesense 

 

 

 

 

net sales for winners and homesense our canadian businesses for fiscal 2007 increased by 19 over fiscal 2006 with approximately onethird of this growth due to currency exchange rates same store sales in local currency increased by 5 in fiscal 2007 and decreased by 3 in fiscal 2006 same store sales for fiscal 2007 were favorably impacted by improved merchandise flow and increased brand penetration in terms of product categories same store sales were driven by strong growth in jewelry footwear and accessories as well as home fashions homesense performed well favorably impacting this division’s results same store sales and operating results for homesense were significantly improved over the prior year 

 

 

segment profit margin for fiscal 2007 was up 21 percentage points to 104 compared to 83 for fiscal 2006 this improvement in segment margin was primarily due to a 14 percentage point increase in merchandise margins improved markon and lower markdowns combined with improved expense ratios leverage from the 5 same store sales increase as well as cost containment initiatives these increases were partially offset by a planned increase in advertising costs which increased 02 percentage points as a percentage of net sales 

 

 

segment profit margin for fiscal 2006 improved by 05 percentage points compared to fiscal 2005 this improvement was primarily due to a 29 percentage point increase in merchandise margins which were driven by improved inventory management resulting in reduced clearance sales and lower markdowns the increase in merchandise margin was partially offset by the delevering impact of the 3 decline in same store sales expense ratios increased across most categories with a 14 percentage point increase in occupancy and distribution costs being the most significant incremental costs associated with three store closings in fiscal 2006 also adversely affected segment profit the comparison of segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 is also favorably impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal 2005 segment profit of a 35 million charge for this division’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment 

 

 

we added a net of 10 winners stores and 10 homesense stores in fiscal 2007 and expanded selling square footage in canada by 7 we expect to add a net of 4 winners and 3 homesense stores in fiscal 2008 increasing our total 

  canadian store base by 3 and increasing selling square footage by 3 the store counts include the winners and homesense portions of this division’s superstores which either combine a winners store with a homesense store or operates them sidebyside as of january 27 2007 we operated 29 of these superstores 

 

tk maxx 

 

 

 

 

net sales in fiscal 2007 for tk maxx operating in the united kingdom and ireland increased by 23 over fiscal 2006 with approximately onefifth of this growth due to currency exchange rates tk maxx had a strong same store sales increase of 9 in local currency in fiscal 2007 with growth in both home fashions and most apparel categories apparel categories that performed well included dresses accessories and footwear while misses sportswear was below the chain average 

 

 

segment profit margin improved to 59 of sales for fiscal 2007 compared to 46 for fiscal 2006 the 13 percentage point improvement was due to merchandise margin which was up 09 percentage points primarily due to lower markdowns as well as expense leverage from the 9 same store sales increase these improvements were partially offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to higher costs for rent utilities and property taxes and costs associated with store relocations 

 

 

segment profit margin for fiscal 2006 declined 03 percentage points to 46 of sales tk maxx had an improved merchandise margin in fiscal 2006 primarily due to lower markdowns in addition the comparison of segment profit and segment margin of fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 was favorably impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal 2005 segment profit of this division’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment of 65 million these improvements however were more than offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to higher cost for rent utilities and property taxes as well as the delevering impact of a 1 same store sales increase distribution and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were essentially flat compared to fiscal 2005 despite the low same store sales increase 

 

 

we added a net of 13 tk maxx stores in fiscal 2007 and increased the division’s selling square footage by 10 we plan to open a net of 10 tk maxx stores in fiscal 2008 and expand selling square footage by 7 also we expect to expand into germany with 5 store openings planned for fiscal 2008 

 

homegoods 

 

 

 

 

homegoods’ same store sales grew 4 in fiscal 2007 due to strong growth in giftware and home decorative products segment profit increased to 609 million from 284 million and segment profit margin almost doubled to 45 of sales the increase in segment profit margin resulted primarily from the leverage of expenses across most categories most notably in distribution center and occupancy expenses additionally merchandise margin increased 04 percentage points primarily due to higher markon 

 

 

homegoods’ same store sales grew 1 in fiscal 2006 customer transactions and unit sales increased at homegoods during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 but these increases were partially offset by a decline in the 

  average ticket resulting from planned changes to the merchandise mix segment profit increased to 284 million from 181 million and segment profit margin increased to 24 of sales from 18 of sales in the prior year the increase in segment profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in merchandise margin lower markdowns partially offset by the impact of higher freight costs as well as the impact on prior year results of the cumulative lease accounting charge of 22 million 

 

 

we opened a net of 19 homegoods stores in fiscal 2007 an 8 increase and increased selling square footage of the division by 7 in fiscal 2008 we plan to add a net of 12 homegoods stores and increase selling square footage by 5 

 

aj wright 

 

 

 

 

aj wright’s same store sales increased 3 for fiscal 2007 consistent with the prior year aj wright’s segment loss for fiscal 2007 increased to 103 million compared to 32 million for the prior year this decline is primarily the result of a decrease in merchandise margin 12 percentage points due to markdowns on belowplan sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 as part of a plan to reposition this business we identified 34 underperforming aj wright stores for closing virtually all of which were closed by fiscal 2007 year end the cost to close these stores and their historical operating results are presented as discontinued operations as described below by closing these marginally profitable stores we reduced the number of advertising markets in which aj wright operates enabling better marketing leverage as well as enabling greater efficiencies in store operations and logistics the store closings also allow management to focus their attention and resources on the remaining better performing stores 

 

 

aj wright’s same store sales increased 3 for fiscal 2006 compared to a 4 increase in same store sales for fiscal 2005 aj wright’s segment loss for fiscal 2006 was narrowed to 32 million from 188 million in fiscal 2005 this improvement was driven by improved merchandise margin primarily the result of lower markdowns in fiscal 2006 the comparison to fiscal 2005 is also impacted by the inclusion of a 17 million charge in fiscal 2005 for its share of the lease accounting adjustment in fiscal 2006 effective expense control also led to a reduction in expenses as a percentage of sales across most expense categories primarily in advertising and store payroll and benefits we reduced the number of our new store openings for aj wright in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2005 as we believed that the pace of store openings in fiscal 2005 may have been too aggressive for this division placing a strain on operations 

 

 

the table above presents aj wright’s operating results from continuing operations stores in operation and selling square footage for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 include store counts and square footage for the stores that are part of our discontinued operations as described earlier during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we identified 34 underperforming aj wright stores to be closed as part of our plan to reposition this business in connection with this action we incurred an aftertax charge of 38 million in the fiscal 2007 fourth quarter this charge represents costs related to asset impairment remaining lease liability net of expected subtenant income and severance and other costs we have classified these exit costs along with operating income or loss related to these stores as discontinued operations in our financial statements for all periods presented the operating income or loss for each year represents the operating results from store operations reduced by an allocation of direct and incremental distribution and administrative costs relating to the closed stores no interest expense was allocated to the discontinued operations the following table presents the net sales and segment profit loss of the closed stores in operation for the last three fiscal years which have been reclassified to discontinued operations 

  discontinued operations 

 

 

 

 

we currently plan to open 5 a j wright stores in fiscal 2008 we continue to believe that aj wright can be a growth vehicle for tjx with its very sizable target demographic 

 

bob’s stores 

 

 

 

 

bob’s stores’ net sales increased 4 for fiscal 2007 compared to a slight decrease last year same store sales increased 2 with our expanded women’s casual sportswear departments performing well bob’s stores reduced its segment losses for the fiscal year due to the sales growth combined with significant improvement in merchandise margins merchandise margin increases were driven by improved markon the result of better buying which more than offset increases in promotional markdowns as we significantly increased the level of promotions in this business 

 

 

net sales for fiscal 2006 were less than the prior year primarily due to a reduction in the number of promotional advertising circulars although merchandise margin improved in fiscal 2006 due to lower promotional markdowns the sales decline and incremental operating costs resulted in an increased segment loss for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 segment loss in fiscal 2006 also includes severance costs of 08 million in connection with a reduction in the work force at bob’s stores 

 

 

for fiscal 2008 we do not plan to open any new stores for this division as we continue to evaluate this business and assess its potential for future growth 

 

general corporate expense 

 

 

 

 

general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments this item includes the costs of the corporate office including the compensation and benefits including stock based compensation for senior corporate management payroll and operating costs of the corporate departments of accounting and budgeting internal audit compliance treasury investor relations tax risk management legal human resources and systems and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff in addition general corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing retirees and nonoperating costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions general corporate expense is included in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 

 

 

fiscal 2007 included pretax charges of approximately 5 million related to the computer intrusion and approximately 5 million related to the corporate division’s cost of the workforce reduction and other termination benefits while fiscal 2006 included costs of 9 million associated with executive resignation agreements and 6 million of costs to exit the e commerce business the increase in other general corporate expenses in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 also reflected increases in corporate payroll corporate marketing and consulting costs charitable contributions and european expansion costs 

 

 

the increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 is primarily due to the costs associated with executive resignation agreements 9 million and of exiting the ecommerce business of 6 million both of these 

  items occurred in our third quarter ended october 29 2005 in addition general corporate expense for fiscal 2006 includes a charge 4 million in connection with an idle leased facility 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

operating activities 

 

 

net cash provided by operating activities was 11950 million in fiscal 2007 11580 million in fiscal 2006 and 10768 million in fiscal 2005 the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings 

 

 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2007 increased by  370 million driven by an increase in net income adjusted for depreciation of 864 million the change in inventory net of accounts payable from prior yearend levels was a significant component of operating cash flows in fiscal 2007 the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a use of cash of 1512 million compared to a source of cash of 262 million in fiscal 2006 fiscal 2007 operating cash flows were also reduced by higher income tax payments these reductions in fiscal 2007 operating cash flows as compared to fiscal 2006 were offset by the favorable cash flow impact of changes in deferred income taxes accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 

 

 

operating cash flows for fiscal 2006 increased by  812 million compared to operating cash flows for fiscal 2005 net income adjusted for depreciation for fiscal 2006 increased by approximately 116 million the change in merchandise inventory net of the related change in accounts payable resulted in a source of cash of 262 million in fiscal 2006 compared to a use of cash of 853 million in fiscal 2005 these increases in fiscal 2006 operating cash flow as compared to fiscal 2005 were offset by the unfavorable cash impact of changes in prepaid expenses and deferred taxes 

 

 

the variance in operating cash flows attributable to the change in the net inventory position over the last three fiscal years is largely explained by our average per store inventory levels at each year end period average per store inventories at january 27 2007 including inventory on hand at our distribution centers increased 7 compared to a decrease of 11 at january 28 2006 this compares to inventories per store at january 29 2005 that were up 1 compared to the prior year 

 

 

discontinued operations reserve we have a reserve for future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases associated with 34 of our aj wright stores see note c to the consolidated financial statements as well as leases of former tjx businesses the balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below 

 

 

 

 

the exit costs related to 34 of our aj wright stores resulted in an addition to the reserve of 62 million in fiscal 2007 all other additions to the reserve are the result of periodic adjustments to our estimated lease obligations of our former businesses and are offset by income from creditor recoveries of a similar amount the lease related charges against the reserve during each fiscal year relate primarily to our former businesses the fixed asset writeoffs and other charges against the reserve for fiscal 2007 relate primarily to the 34 aj wright closed stores virtually all of which were closed at the end of fiscal 2007 

   

approximately 43 million of the fiscal 2007 reserve balance relates to the aj wright store closings primarily our estimation of lease costs net of estimated subtenant income the remainder of the reserve reflects our estimation of the cost of claims updated quarterly that have been or we believe are likely to be made against tjx for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases of former businesses after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations at january 27 2007 substantially all the leases of former businesses that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against tjx had been resolved the actual net cost of aj wright lease obligations may differ from our original estimate although tjx’s actual costs with respect to the lease obligations of former businesses may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve and tjx may incur costs for leases from these former businesses that were not terminated or had not expired tjx does not expect to incur any material costs related to these discontinued operations in excess of the amounts estimated we estimate that the majority of this reserve will be paid in the next three to five years the actual timing of cash outflows will vary depending on how the remaining lease obligations are actually settled 

 

 

we may also be contingently liable on up to 15 leases of bj’s wholesale club a former tjx business for which bj’s wholesale club is primarily liable our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to tjx with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of bj’s wholesale club 

 

potential liabilities in connection with computer intrusion 

 

 

we believe that customer information was stolen in the computer intrusion in 2005 and 2006 and that such information most likely primarily relates to transactions at our stores other than bob’s stores during the periods 2003 through june 2004 and midmay 2006 through middecember 2006 see item 1business under the caption “computer intrusion” 

 

 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded a pretax charge of approximately 5 million or 001 per share for costs incurred through the fourth quarter in connection with the computer intrusion which includes costs incurred to investigate and contain the computer intrusion strengthen computer security and systems and communicate with customers and for technical legal and other fees in addition various litigation and claims have been or may be asserted against us andor our acquiring banks on behalf of customers including various putative class actions seeking in the aggregate to represent all customers in the united states puerto rico and canada whose transaction information was allegedly compromised by the computer intrusion banks and payment card companies seeking damages allegedly arising out of the computer intrusion and other related relief including a putative class action seeking to represent all financial institutions that issued payment cards to our customers used at our stores during the period of the computer intrusion and shareholders we intend to defend such litigation and claims vigorously although the outcome of such litigation and claims cannot be predicted in addition various governmental agencies are investigating the computer intrusion and we may be subject to fines or other obligations as a result of these investigations certain banks have sought and other banks and payment card companies may seek either directly against us or through claims against our acquiring banks as to which we may have an indemnity obligation payment of or reimbursement for fraudulent card charges and operating expenses that they believe they have incurred by reason of the computer intrusion and payment card companies and associations may seek to impose fines by reason of the computer intrusion we do not have sufficient information to reasonably estimate losses that may result from such litigation claims and investigations as such no liability has been recorded as of january 27 2007 we will continue to evaluate information as it becomes known and will record an estimate for losses at the time or times when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable such losses could be material to our results of operations and financial condition regardless of the outcome claims litigation and proceedings of this type are expensive and could require us to devote substantial resources and time to defending them 

 

 

offbalance sheet liabilities we have contingent obligations on leases for which we were a lessee or guarantor which were assigned to third parties without tjx being released by the landlords over many years we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties with the exception of leases of our former businesses discussed above we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases and accordingly we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them which could be triggered in the event that one or more of the current tenants does not fulfill their obligations related to one or more of these leases 

   

we also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate we estimate the undiscounted obligations not reflected in our reserves of leases of closed stores of continuing operations bj’s wholesale club leases discussed above and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations is approximately 105 million as of january 27 2007 we believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to tjx and to the extent they do will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors 

 

 

we are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold specified environmental matters or certain income taxes these obligations are typically limited in time and amount there are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations 

 

investing activities 

 

 

our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table below 

 

 

 

 

we expect that capital expenditures will approximate 500 million for fiscal 2008 which we expect to pay through internally generated funds this includes 108 million for new stores 267 million for store renovations expansions and improvements and 125 million for our office and distribution centers the planned increase in capital expenditures is attributable to increased spending on renovations and improvements to existing stores particularly tj maxx marshalls and tk maxx as well as an increase in capital spending for systems enhancements and improvements to the distribution centers 

 

financing activities 

 

 

cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 4180 million in fiscal 2007 5037 million in fiscal 2006 and 5846 million in fiscal 2005 the majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program 

 

 

we spent 5572 million in fiscal 2007 6037 million in fiscal 2006 and 5946 million in fiscal 2005 under our stock repurchase programs we repurchased 220 million shares in fiscal 2007 259 million shares in fiscal 2006 and 251 million shares in fiscal 2005 all shares repurchased were retired through january 27 2007 under our current 1 billion multiyear stock repurchase program we had spent 564 million on the repurchase of 223 million shares of tjx common stock as a result of the discovery and investigation of the computer intrusion in december 2006 we temporarily suspended our share repurchase activity in january 2007 our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase of up to 1 billion of tjx common stock from time to time which is in addition to the 436 million remaining in the existing plan at fiscal 2007 year end 

 

 

in january 2006 winners entered into a c235 million us2044 term credit facility guaranteed by tjx this credit facility was originally due in january 2009 and has been extended to january 2010 interest is payable at rates equal to or less than the canadian prime rate winners entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively established a fixed interest rate of approximately 45 on this debt the proceeds were used to fund the repatriation of winners earnings to tjx as well as other general corporate purposes of this division financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on longterm debt of 100 million in fiscal 2006 and 5 million in fiscal 2005 for fiscal 2007 there were no scheduled principal payments on longterm debt 

 

 

we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 028 per share in fiscal 2007 024 per share in fiscal 2006 and 018 per share in fiscal 2005 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 1229 million in fiscal 2007 1053 million in fiscal 2006 and 834 million in fiscal 2005 financing activities also 

  included proceeds of 2602 in fiscal 2007 1024 million in fiscal 2006 and 969 million in fiscal 2005 from the exercise of employee stock options 

 

 

we traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of shortterm commercial paper in fiscal 2007 we amended our 500 million fouryear revolving credit facility and our 500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility initially entered into in fiscal 2006 to extend the maturity dates of these agreements until may 2010 and may 2011 respectively these credit facilities have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings we also have a commercial paper program pursuant to which we issue commercial paper from time to time these agreements serve as back up to our commercial paper program as of january 27 2007 we had no shortterm debt outstanding the maximum amount of our us shortterm borrowings outstanding was 205 million during fiscal 2007 567 million during fiscal 2006 and 5 million during fiscal 2005 the weighted average interest rate on our us shortterm borrowings was 535 in fiscal 2007 369 in fiscal 2006 and 204 in fiscal 2005 

 

 

as of january 27 2007 and january 28 2006 winners had two credit lines one for c10 million for operating expenses and one c10 million letter of credit facility the maximum amount outstanding under our canadian credit line for operating expenses was c38 million in fiscal 2007 c46 million in fiscal 2006 and c68 million in fiscal 2005 and there were no amounts outstanding on either of these lines at the end of fiscal 2007 or fiscal 2006 as of january 27 2007 tk maxx had credit lines totaling £20 million the maximum amount outstanding in fiscal 2007 was £105 million and there were no outstanding borrowings on this credit line at january 27 2007 

 

 

we believe that internally generated funds and our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs for at least the next twelve months see note d to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our longterm debt and available financing sources 

 

 

contractual obligations as of january 27 2007 we had payment obligations including current installments under longterm debt arrangements leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows in thousands 

 

 

 

 

the longterm debt obligations above include estimated interest costs and assume that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put option in fiscal 2014 if none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted the notes will mature in fiscal 2022 the effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based on their values as of january 27 2007 

 

 

the lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay these costs were approximately onethird of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended january 27 2007 

 

 

our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise purchase orders for capital expenditures supplies and other operating needs commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services and commitments under executive employment and other agreements we excluded longterm agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty 

 

 

we also have longterm liabilities which include 1200 million for employee compensation and benefits most of which will come due beyond five years derivative contracts of approximately 1000 million the majority of which come 

  due in fiscal 2010 and 1420 million for accrued rent the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

 

tjx must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to inventory valuation retirement obligations casualty insurance accounting for taxes reserves for discontinued operations and loss contingencies we believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained had alternative assumptions been selected would not be materially different from the results we have reported 

 

 

inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory on a firstin firstout basis under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory this method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage a significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods in addition as a normal business practice we have a specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing the need for management estimates inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but is based on a full physical inventory at fiscal year end thus the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results but is not a factor in full year results overall we believe that the retail method coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated lastly many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions which ultimately affect the value of the inventory our offprice businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors bob’s stores the valueoriented retailer we acquired in december 2003 does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain conditions are met these arrangements may have some impact on bob’s stores’ inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results 

 

 

retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates we are required to make assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the longterm rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period the discount rate which we determine annually based on market interest rates and our estimated longterm rate of return which can differ considerably from actual returns are two factors that can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and the funded status of our qualified pension plan we have made contributions of 65 million which exceeded the minimum required over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan 

 

 

casualty insurance tjx’s casualty insurance program requires tjx to estimate the total claims it will incur as a component of its annual insurance cost the estimated claims are developed with the assistance of an actuary based on historical experience and other factors these estimates involve significant estimates and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates if tjx’s estimate for the claims component of its casualty insurance expense for fiscal 2007 were to change by 10 the fiscal 2007 pretax cost would increase or decrease by approximately 5 million a large portion of these claims are funded with a nonrefundable payment during the policy year offsetting our estimated claims accrual the company has a net accrual of 314 million for the unfunded portion of its casualty insurance program as of january 27 2007 

 

 

accounting for taxes like many large corporations we are regularly under audit by the united states federal state local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions we accrue charges for possible exposures based on the annual evaluations of tax positions we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves our effective income tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted the internal revenue service has examined the fiscal years ended january 2000 through january 2003 and several proposed adjustments are under appeal we also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process 

   

reserves for discontinued operations as discussed in note l to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the management’s discussion and analysis we have reserves established for leases relating to operations discontinued by tjx where tjx was the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned to third parties these are longterm obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions as to whether we remain obligated with respect to a particular lease amounts of subtenant income how a particular obligation may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors including indemnification may exist we develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location actual results may differ from these estimates but we believe that our current reserve is a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcome and that the reserve is adequate to cover the ultimate cost we will incur 

 

 

loss contingencies certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued which may result in a loss to tjx but which will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur tjx’s management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment in assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against tjx or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings tjx’s legal counsel evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein 

 

 

if the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated then the estimated liability would be accrued in the financial statements if the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible or is probable but cannot be estimated then tjx will disclose the nature of the contingent liability together with an estimate of the range of the possible loss or a statement that such loss is not estimable 

 

recent accounting pronouncements 

 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132 r” sfas no 158 sfas no 158 requires the recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the balance sheet the recognition in other comprehensive income of gains or losses and prior service costs or credits arising during the period but which are not included as components of periodic benefit cost the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date the measurement provisions and disclosure of additional information about the effects on periodic benefit cost for the following fiscal year arising from delayed recognition in the current period the requirement to recognize the funded status of the plan on the balance sheet is required for the fiscal year ended january 27 2007 and is reflected in our accompanying financial statements the adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income of initially applying the recognition provisions of sfas no 158 was a reduction net of taxes of 56 million the requirement to measure the plan assets and obligations as of the balance sheet date can be deferred until our fiscal year ending january 2008 the current measurement date of our plans is december 31 and we have elected to defer adopting the measurement provisions until next fiscal year the impact of applying the measurement provisions of sfas no 158 will not have a material impact on our statement of financial position 

 

 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements the interpretation requires that we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority if a tax position meets the more likely than not recognition criteria fin 48 requires the tax position be measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement fin 48 must be applied to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption this accounting standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 fiscal 2008 for the company upon adoption we anticipate an increase to our reserves for uncertain tax positions we do not expect that the impact will be material to our financial statements 

 

 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 requires companies to disclose the fair value of their financial instruments according to a fair value hierarchy as defined in the standard additionally companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding financial instruments in one of the categories level 3 including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities sfas no 157 is effective for financial statements 

  issued for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years we believe the adoption of sfas no 157 will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

 

 

we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

 

 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our canadian winners and homesense and european tk maxx operations as more fully described in notes a and e to the consolidated financial statements we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations intercompany transactions with these operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations with derivative financial instruments we enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures most of these gains and losses are recorded directly in shareholders’ equity the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of january 27 2007 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

interest rate risk 

 

 

our cash equivalents and shortterm investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by tjx in addition changes in the gross amount of our borrowings will affect the impact on our future interest expense of future changes in interest rates we occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing however we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year as of january 27 2007 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

 

market risk 

 

 

the assets of our qualified pension plan a large portion of which is invested in equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market we allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties

 item 1 business 

  we are the leading offprice retailer of apparel and home fashions in the united states and worldwide our seven offprice chains are synergistic in their philosophies and operating platforms we sell offprice family apparel and home fashions through our tj maxx marshalls and aj wright chains in the united states our winners chain in canada and our tk maxx chain in the united kingdom and ireland we sell offprice home fashions through our homegoods chain in the united states and our canadian homesense chain operated by winners the target customer for all of our offprice chains except aj wright is the middle to uppermiddle income shopper with the same profile as a department or specialty store customer aj wright targets the moderate income customer bob’s stores acquired in december 2003 is a valueoriented branded apparel chain based in the northeast united states that offers casual family apparel bob’s stores’ target customer demographic spans the moderate to uppermiddle income bracket 

  our offprice mission is to deliver an exciting fresh and rapidly changing assortment of brandname merchandise at excellent values to our customers we define value as the combination of quality brand fashion and price with over 400 buyers and over 10000 vendors worldwide and over 2300 stores we believe we are well positioned to continue accomplishing this goal our key strengths include 

   as an offprice retailer we offer quality name brand and designer family apparel and home fashions every day at substantial savings from comparable department and specialty store regular prices we can offer these everyday savings as a result of our opportunistic buying strategies disciplined inventory management including rapid inventory turns and low expense structure 

  in our offprice concepts we purchase the majority of our inventory opportunistically different from traditional retailers that order goods far in advance of the time they appear on the selling floor tjx buyers are in the marketplace virtually every week by maintaining a liquid inventory position our buyers can buy close to need enabling them to buy into current market trends and take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace due to the unpredictable nature of consumer demand in the marketplace and the mismatch of supply and demand we are regularly able to buy the vast majority of our inventory directly from manufacturers with some merchandise coming from retailers and others virtually all of our buys for our offprice concepts are made at discounts from initial wholesale prices we generally purchase merchandise to sell in the current selling season with a limited quantity of packaway merchandise that we buy specifically to warehouse and sell in a future selling season we are willing to purchase less than a full assortment of styles and sizes we pay promptly and do not ask for typical retail concessions in our offprice chains such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances or delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries our financial strength strong reputation and ability to sell large quantities of merchandise through a geographically diverse network of stores provide us excellent access to leading branded merchandise our opportunistic buying permits us to consistently offer our customers a rapidly changing merchandise assortment at everyday values that are below department and specialty store regular prices 

  we are extremely disciplined in our inventory management and we rapidly turn the inventory in our offprice chains we rely heavily on sophisticated internally developed inventory systems and controls that permit a virtually continuous flow of merchandise into our stores and an expansive distribution infrastructure that supports our closeto need buying by delivering goods to our stores quickly and efficiently for example highly automated storage and distribution systems track allocate and deliver an average of 11000 items per week to each tj maxx and marshalls 

1 store in addition specialized computer inventory planning purchasing and monitoring systems coupled with warehouse storage processing handling and shipping systems permit a continuous evaluation and rapid replenishment of store inventory pricing markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment requirements are determined centrally using satellitetransmitted information provided by pointof sale computer terminals and are designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner these inventory management and distribution systems allow us to achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of product and sell substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods 

  we operate with a low cost structure relative to many other retailers while we seek to provide a pleasant easy shopping environment with emphasis on customer convenience we do not spend large amounts on store fixtures our selling floor space is flexible and largely free of permanent fixtures so we can easily expand and contract departments in response to customer demand and available merchandise also our large retail presence strong financial position and expertise in the real estate market allow us to obtain very favorable lease terms in our offprice concepts our advertising budget as a percentage of sales is low compared to traditional department and specialty stores with our advertising focused mainly on awareness of shopping at our stores and some promoting of particular merchandise our high salespersquarefoot productivity and rapid inventory turnover also provide expense efficiencies 

  with all of our offprice chains operating with the same offprice strategies and systems we are able to capitalize upon expertise and best practices across our chains develop associates by transferring them from one chain to another and grow our various businesses more efficiently and effectively 

  during the fiscal year ended january 28 2006 we derived 802 of our sales from the united states 292 from the northeast 142 from the midwest 231 from the south 07 from the central plains and 130 from the west 91 from canada 95 from europe specifically in the united kingdom and ireland and 12 from puerto rico by merchandise category we derived approximately 65 of our sales from apparel including footwear 24 from home fashions and 11 from jewelry and accessories 

  we consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment the tj maxx and marshalls store chains are managed as one division referred to as marmaxx and are reported as a single segment the winners and homesense chains which operate exclusively in canada are also managed as one division and are reported as a single segment each of our other store chains tk maxx homegoods aj wright and bob’s stores are reported as separate segments more detailed information about our segments can be found in note n to the consolidated financial statements 

  unless otherwise indicated all store information is as of january 28 2006 and references to store square footage are to gross square feet fiscal 2004 means the fiscal year ended january 31 2004 fiscal 2005 means the fiscal year ended january 29 2005 fiscal 2006 means the fiscal year ended january 28 2006 and fiscal 2007 means the fiscal year ending january 27 2007 our business is subject to seasonal influences which causes us generally to realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the year this is common in the apparel retail business in fiscal 2006 we closed our tj maxx and homegoods ecommerce website 

tj maxx and marshalls 

  tj maxx is the largest offprice retail chain in the united states with 799 stores in 48 states marshalls is the secondlargest offprice retailer in the united states with 701 stores in 42 states as well as 14 stores in puerto rico we maintain the separate identities of the tj maxx and marshalls stores through product assortment and merchandising marketing and store appearance this encourages our customers to shop at both chains 

  tj maxx and marshalls primarily target female shoppers who have families with middle to uppermiddle incomes and who generally fit the profile of a department or specialty store customer these chains operate with a common buying and merchandising organization and have consolidated administrative functions including finance and human resources the combined organization known internally as the marmaxx group offers us increased leverage to purchase merchandise at favorable prices and allows us to operate with a lower cost structure these advantages are key to our ability to sell quality brand name merchandise at substantial discounts from department and specialty store regular prices 

2   tj maxx and marshalls sell quality brand name merchandise at prices generally 2060 below department and specialty store regular prices both chains offer family apparel accessories giftware and home fashions within these broad categories tj maxx offers a shoe assortment for women and fine jewelry while marshalls offers a fullline footwear department and a larger men’s department in fiscal 2006 tj maxx continued to roll out expanded jewelry and accessories departments and marshalls continued to add expanded footwear departments we believe these expanded offerings further differentiate the shopping experience at tj maxx and marshalls driving traffic to both chains and we expect to continue rolling out these expanded departments 

  tj maxx and marshalls stores are generally located in suburban community shopping centers tj maxx stores average approximately 30000 square feet marshalls stores average approximately 32000 square feet we currently expect to add a net of 50 stores in fiscal 2007 ultimately we believe that tj maxx and marshalls together can operate approximately 1800 stores in the united states and puerto rico 

homegoods 

  homegoods is our offprice retail chain that sells exclusively home fashions with a broad array of giftware accent furniture lamps rugs accessories and seasonal merchandise for the home many of the homegoods stores are standalone stores however we also combine homegoods stores with a tj maxx or marshalls store in a superstore format we count the superstores as both a tj maxx or marshalls store and a homegoods store in fiscal 2006 we continued to open a superstore format in which a homegoods store is located beside a tj maxx or marshalls store with interior passageways providing access between the stores this configuration is dualbranded with both the tj maxx or marshalls logo and the homegoods logo 

  standalone homegoods stores average approximately 27000 square feet in superstores which average approximately 50000 square feet we dedicate an average of 22000 square feet to homegoods the 251 stores open at yearend include 140 standalone stores and 111 superstores in fiscal 2007 we plan to net 10 additional stores including 4 superstores we believe that the us market could potentially support approximately 650 homegoods stores in the long term 

winners and homesense 

  winners is the leading offprice retailer in canada offering offprice brand name women’s apparel and shoes lingerie accessories home fashions giftware fine jewelry menswear and children’s clothing winners operates homesense our canadian offprice homefashions chain launched in fiscal 2002 like our homegoods chain homesense offers a wide and rapidly changing assortment of offprice home fashions including giftware accent furniture lamps rugs accessories and seasonal merchandise we operate homesense in a standalone format as well as a superstore format where a homesense store and a winners store are combined or operate sidebyside 

  we currently operate a total of 174 winners stores which average approximately 30000 square feet and 58 homesense stores which average approximately 24000 square feet we expect to add a net of 11 winners stores and 10 homesense stores in fiscal 2007 in both the standalone and superstore format ultimately we believe the canadian market can support approximately 200 winners stores and approximately 80 homesense stores 

tk maxx 

  tk maxx operating in the united kingdom and ireland is the only major offprice retailer in any european country tk maxx utilizes the same offprice strategies employed by tj maxx marshalls and winners and offers the same type of merchandise at the end of fiscal 2006 we operated 197 tk maxx stores which averaged approximately 30000 square feet we expect to add a total of 15 stores in the united kingdom and ireland in fiscal 2007 and believe that the uk and ireland can support approximately 300 stores in the long term 

aj wright 

  aj wright launched in fiscal 1999 brings our offprice concept to a different demographic customer the moderate income shopper aj wright stores offer brandname family apparel accessories footwear domestics giftware 

3 including toys and games and special opportunistic purchases aj wright stores average approximately 26000 square feet we operated 152 aj wright stores in the united states at fiscal year end in fiscal 2007 we expect to net 8 ajwright stores primarily in existing markets to lever advertising and distribution costs in the long term we believe that the us could potentially support approximately 1000 aj wright stores 

bob’s stores 

  bob’s stores acquired in late 2003 offers casual family apparel and footwear including workwear activewear and licensed team apparel bob’s stores’ customer demographics span the moderate to uppermiddle income bracket bob’s stores average approximately 46000 square feet and at the end of fiscal 2006 there were 35 bob’s stores in operation we expect to open one bob’s store in fiscal 2007

5 employees

competition 

  the retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive we compete on the basis of fashion quality price merchandise selection and freshness brand name recognition and to a lesser degree store location we compete with local regional national and international department specialty offprice discount and outlet stores as well as other retailers that sell in stores through catalogues and media and over the internet we purchase most of our inventory opportunistically and compete for that merchandise with other national and regional offprice apparel and outlet stores we also compete with other retailers for store locations 

credit 

  our stores operate primarily on a cashandcarry basis each chain accepts credit sales through programs offered by banks and others while we do not operate our own customer credit card program or maintain customer credit receivables a tjx visa card is offered through a major bank for our domestic divisions the rewards program associated with this card is partially funded by tjx 

buying and distribution

 item 1a risk factors 

  the statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully in addition these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

6   our disclosure and analysis in this 2005 form 10k and in our 2005 annual report to shareholders contain some forwardlooking statements including some of the statements made under item 1 “business” item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data” and in our 2005 annual report to stockholders under “letter to shareholders” and “financial graphs” from time to time we also provide forwardlooking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forwardlooking statements such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts we have generally identified such statements by using words such as “anticipate” “estimate” “expect” “project” “intend” “plan” “believe” “will” “target” “forecast” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance all statements that address activities events or developments that we intend expect or believe may occur in the future are forwardlooking statements in particular these include statements relating to future actions future performance or results of current and anticipated sales expenses interest rates foreign exchange rates the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results 

  we cannot guarantee that any forwardlooking statement will be realized achievement of future results is subject to risks uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated estimated or projected you should bear this in mind as you consider forwardlooking statements 

  we undertake no obligation to publicly update forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are advised however to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our form 10q and 8k reports to the sec the risks that follow individually or in the aggregate are those that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in forwardlooking statements you should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors consequently you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties 

our revenue growth could be adversely affected if we do not continue to expand our operations successfully 

  tjx has rapidly expanded the number of chains and stores it operates and its selling square footage our revenue growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand successfully through new store openings as well as our ability to increase same store sales successful store growth requires selection of store locations in appropriate geographies availability of attractive stores or store sites in such locations and negotiation of acceptable terms competition for desirable sites and increases in real estate construction and development costs could limit our growth opportunities even if we succeed in opening new stores these new stores may not achieve the same sales or profit levels as our existing stores further expansion places demands upon us to manage rapid growth and we may not do so successfully 

we may have difficulty extending our offprice model in new product lines chains and geographic regions 

  tjx has expanded its original offprice model into different product lines chains geographic areas and countries tjx’s growth is dependent upon our ability to successfully execute our offprice retail apparel and home fashions concepts in new markets and geographic regions if the company is unable to successfully execute its concepts in these new markets and regions or if consumers there are not receptive to the concepts tjx’s financial performance could be adversely affected 

if we fail to execute our opportunistic buying and inventory management well our business could be adversely affected 

  tjx purchases the majority of our inventory opportunistically with our buyers purchasing close to need to drive traffic to the stores and to increase same store sales the treasure hunt nature of the offprice buying experience requires continued replenishment of fresh high quality attractively priced merchandise while opportunistic buying enables our buyers to buy at the right time and price in the quantities we need and into market trends it places considerable discretion in our buyers subjecting us to risks on the timing quantity and nature of inventory flowing to the stores we rely on our expansive distribution infrastructure to support delivering goods to our stores on time we must effectively and timely distribute inventory to stores maintain an appropriate mix and level of inventory and effectively manage 

7 pricing and markdowns failure to acquire and manage our inventory well and to operate our distribution infrastructure effectively can adversely affect our performance and our relationship with our customers 

our success depends upon our marketing advertising and promotional efforts if we are unable to implement them successfully or if our competitors are more effective than we are our revenue may be adversely affected 

  we use marketing and promotional programs to attract customers to our stores and to encourage purchases by our customers we use various media for our promotional efforts including print television database marketing and direct marketing if we fail to choose the appropriate medium for our efforts or fail to implement and execute new marketing opportunities our competitors may be able to attract some of our customers and cause them to decrease purchases in our stores and increase purchases elsewhere which might negatively impact our revenues changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity or merchandising strategy by our competitors could cause tjx to have difficulties in retaining existing customers and attracting new customers 

unseasonable weather in the markets in which our stores operate could adversely affect our operating results 

  customers’ willingness to shop and their demand for the merchandise in our stores is affected by adverse and unseasonable weather frequent or unusually heavy snow ice or rain storms severe cold or heat or extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets could adversely affect our sales and increase markdowns 

we operate in highly competitive markets and we may not be able to compete effectively 

  the retail business is highly competitive tjx competes for customers associates locations merchandise services and other important aspects of its business with many other local regional national and international retailers tjx also faces competition from alternative retail distribution channels such as catalogues and internet sites changes in the merchandising pricing and promotional activities of those competitors and in the retail industry generally may adversely affect our performance 

if we do not attract and retain quality sales distribution center and other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel our performance could be adversely affected 

  tjx’s performance is dependent on recruiting developing training and retaining quality sales distribution center and other associates in large numbers as well as experienced buying and management personnel many of our associates are in entry level or parttime positions with historically high rates of turnover tjx’s ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels prevailing wage rates minimum wage legislation and changing demographics in the event of increasing wage rates if we do not increase our wages competitively our customer service could suffer because of a declining quality of our workforce or our earnings would decrease if we increase our wage rates in addition certain associates in our distribution centers are members of unions and therefore subject us to the risk of labor actions further our offprice model limits the market for experienced buying and management personnel and requires us to do significant internal training and development changes that adversely impact tjx’s ability to attract and retain quality associates and management personnel could adversely affect our performance 

if we engage in mergers or acquisitions of new businesses or divest any of our current businesses our business will be subject to additional risks 

  we have used mergers and acquisitions to grow our business in the past for example in 2003 we completed the acquisition of bob’s stores integrating new stores and concepts can be a difficult task we may consider attractive opportunities to acquire new businesses or to divest any of our current business segment acquisition or divestiture activities may divert attention of our executive management team away from the existing businesses we may do a less than optimal job of due diligence or evaluation of target companies failure to execute on mergers or divestitures in a satisfactory manner could have an adverse effect on our future business prospects or our financial performance in the future 

8 if we are unable to operate information systems and implement new technologies effectively our business could be disrupted or our sales or profitability could be reduced 

  the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems including our ability to operate them effectively and successfully to implement new technologies systems controls and adequate disaster recovery systems in addition we must protect the confidentiality of our and our customers’ data the failure of tjx’s information systems to perform as designed or our failure to implement and operate them effectively could disrupt our business or subject us to liability and thereby harm our profitability 

we expect to continue to depend upon strong cash flows from our operations to support capital expansion operations debt repayment and our stock repurchase program 

  tjx’s business is dependent upon its operations generating strong cash flows to support our capital expansion requirements our general operating activities and our stock repurchase programs and to fund debt repayment and the availability of financing sources our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of availability of financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms could adversely affect our financial performance or our earnings per share growth 

consumer spending is adversely affected by general economic factors that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our sales and operating results 

  interest rates recession inflation deflation consumer credit availability consumer debt levels energy costs tax rates and policy unemployment trends the threat or possibility of war terrorism or other global or national unrest political or financial instability and other general economic factors have significant effects on consumer confidence and spending which in turn affect retail sales at tjx general economic factors in the united states and in other countries where we operate are beyond our control and could adversely affect our sales and performance 

we are subject to import risks including potential disruptions in supply changes in duties tariffs quotas and voluntary export restrictions on imported merchandise strikes and other events affecting delivery and economic political or other problems in countries from or through which merchandise is imported 

  many of the products sold in our stores are sourced by our vendors and to a limited extent by us in many foreign countries political or financial instability trade restrictions tariffs currency exchange rates transport capacity and costs and other factors relating to international trade are beyond our control and could affect the availability and the price of our inventory 

our expanding international operations expose us to risks inherent in foreign operations 

  we have a significant presence in canada the united kingdom and ireland we may also seek to expand into other international markets in the future our foreign operations encounter risks similar to those faced by our us operations as well as risks inherent in foreign operations such as local customs and competitive conditions and foreign currency fluctuations which could have an adverse impact on our worldwide profitability 

changes in laws and regulations and accounting rules and principles could negatively affect our business operations and financial performance 

  various aspects of tjx’s operations are subject to federal state or local laws rules and regulations any of which may change from time to time generally accepted accounting principles may change from time to time as well additionally tjx is frequently involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business litigation regulatory developments and changes in accounting rules and principles could adversely affect tjx’s business operations and financial performance 

9 we maintain internal controls over financial reporting but they cannot provide absolute assurance that there will not be material errors in our financial reporting 

  tjx maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting but there are limitations inherent in internal control systems if we are unable to maintain adequate and effective internal control over financial reporting tjx’s financial performance could be adversely affected a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be appropriate relative to their costs

  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 tjx elected to early adopt the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” this standard requires that the fair value of all stock based awards be reflected in the financial statements based on the fair value of the award tjx has elected the modified retrospective transition method and accordingly all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this standard in those periods based on the pro forma amounts as disclosed in the notes to our financial statements 

results of operations 

fiscal 2006 overview 

  

 

 

 15    the following is a summary of the operating results of tjx at the consolidated level this discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment all references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise indicated all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of sfas no 123r see note a to our consolidated financial statements 

  net sales net sales for fiscal 2006 totaled 161 billion an 8 increase over net sales of 149 billion in fiscal 2005 net sales for fiscal 2005 increased 12 over sales of 133 billion for fiscal 2004 our reporting period for fiscal 2004 included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 which added incremental sales of approximately 200 million in fiscal 2004 

  the 8 increase in net sales for fiscal 2006 includes a 6 increase attributable to new stores and a 2 increase in same store sales the 12 increase in net sales for fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 reflects approximately 6 from new stores 5 from same store sales growth and 2 from the acquisition of bob’s stores partially offset by approximately a 1 reduction to the growth rate due to fiscal 2005 having one less week than fiscal 2004 bob’s stores was acquired on december 24 2003 and our sales results for fiscal 2004 include bob’s stores from the date of acquisition as compared to a full year for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 

  new stores are a major source of sales growth our consolidated store count increased by 71 in fiscal 2006 and 78 in fiscal 2005 over the respective prior year period our selling square footage increased by 77 in fiscal 2006 and 82 in fiscal 2005 we expect to add 105 stores net of store closings in the fiscal year ending january 27 2007 fiscal 2007 a 4 projected increase in our consolidated store base and we expect to increase our selling square footage base by 5 

  same store sales for fiscal 2006 were driven by strong demand for jewelry accessories and footwear which continued to generate significant increases on top of very strong results last year as well as improved demand for men’s apparel the positive impact of growth in these categories was partially offset by same store sales declines in home fashions and women’s sportswear marmaxx continued its program of expanding certain departments in its stores and ended the year with 594 tj maxx stores with expanded jewelry accessories departments and 146 marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments these stores had same store sales growth which exceeded marmaxx’s chain average in the united states where tjx generates approximately 80 of its sales same store sales were strong in warm weather regions particularly florida the southwest and california while flat to slightly negative in the midwest and northeast same store sales growth was positively impacted by foreign currency exchange rates which contributed approximately 1  2 a percentage point of growth 

  net sales for fiscal 2005 reflected strong demand for jewelry and accessories women’s apparel and footwear partially offset by weaker demand for men’s apparel and home fashions the 5 growth in consolidated same store sales for fiscal 2005 over the prior year was driven by a 4 same store sales increase at marmaxx our largest division marmaxx ended the year with 303 tj maxx stores with expanded jewelry accessories departments and 67 marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments which were significant factors in marmaxx achieving a 4 same store sales increase in fiscal 2005 same store sales growth in fiscal 2005 benefited by approximately 1 1  2 percentage points from foreign currency exchange rates 

  we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year on a comparable 52 week basis relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we 

16 believe the impact of these stores on the same store percentage is immaterial consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in us dollars we also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of their operating performance 

  the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales 

   cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 766 in fiscal 2006 764 in fiscal 2005 and 758 in fiscal 2004 this ratio for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 reflects an improvement in our consolidated merchandise margin of 5 the improvement in merchandise margin was largely due to lower markdowns at our smaller divisions partially offset by an increase in fuel related freight costs in addition the comparison to the fiscal 2005 expense ratio was favorably impacted by a 307 million noncash charge 193 million aftertax in fiscal 2005 to conform our lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting principles see note a to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “lease accounting” this charge was included in cost of sales in fiscal 2005 and increased last year’s expense ratio by 2 these improvements in the fiscal 2006 expense ratio were more than offset by increases in operating costs as a percentage of net sales primarily occupancy costs which reflect the delevering impact of a 2 same store sales growth as well as higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than marmaxx which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

  cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2005 as compared with fiscal 2004 reflects consolidated merchandise margins that were essentially flat to the prior year throughout fiscal 2005 the marmaxx division effectively executed its merchandising and inventory management strategies maintaining a liquid inventory position and buying close to need all of which led to improved merchandise margin at this division however this improved merchandise margin at marmaxx in fiscal 2005 was offset by reduced merchandise margin at our other divisions most of which experienced higher markdowns the increase in this ratio in fiscal 2005 includes a 2 increase due to the lease accounting charge this ratio in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 also reflects an increase of approximately 2 due to the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2005 as the sales volume from the extra week helped lever certain fixed costs in fiscal 2004 the balance of the increase in the ratio in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than marmaxx which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 

  selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 169 in fiscal 2006 168 in fiscal 2005 and 166 in fiscal 2004 the increase in fiscal 2006 over the prior year is due to an increase in store payroll costs as a percentage of net sales reflecting the delevering impact of the low single digit same store sales increase the increase in this ratio was also negatively impacted by the net impact of third quarter events including the cost of the executive resignation agreements ecommerce exit and hurricane related costs offset in part by the visamastercard antitrust litigation settlement the increase in this ratio in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a 1 increase in advertising costs as a percentage of sales as a result of the inclusion of bob’s stores for a full fiscal year in our consolidated results bob’s stores operates with a higher advertising cost ratio than our offprice divisions in addition the fiscal 2005 expense ratio compared to fiscal 2004 reflects an increase in stock based compensation tjx has taken various actions to reduce selling general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 designed to improve profit margins tjx also revised its approach to longterm compensation in fiscal 2006 by substantially decreasing the number 

17 of stock options issued and increasing the longterm cash incentive award opportunities which is designed to help control the longterm portion of compensation costs going forward 

  interest expense net interest expense net of interest income was 296 million in fiscal 2006 258 million in fiscal 2005 and 273 million in fiscal 2004 interest income was 94 million in fiscal 2006 77 million in fiscal 2005 and 65 million in fiscal 2004 the increase in net interest expense in fiscal 2006 is due to higher shortterm borrowings and interest rates the higher borrowing levels were primarily driven by the timing of inventory purchases capital expenditures and repurchase of the company’s common stock the additional interest expense from shortterm borrowings was partially offset by reduced interest costs due to the repayment of 100 million of 7 unsecured notes in june 2005 as well as an increase in interest income due to higher interest rates the reduction in net interest expense in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 is primarily due to an increase in interest income in fiscal 2005 

  income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was 316 in fiscal 2006 383 in fiscal 2005 and 382 in fiscal 2004 the tax provision for fiscal 2006 includes a fourth quarter benefit of 47 million due to the repatriation of earnings from our canadian subsidiary in addition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 we corrected our accounting for the tax impact of foreign currency gains on certain intercompany loans we had previously established a deferred tax liability on these gains which are not taxable the impact of correcting for the tax treatment of these gains results in a tax benefit of 22 million or 04 per share in fiscal 2006 the cumulative impact of this adjustment through the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2006 was 182 million all of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 of the 182 million 101 million related to fiscal 2005 these two items collectively reduced the fiscal 2006 effective income tax rate by 68 see note h to the consolidated financial statements the increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to increases in state income tax rates 

  net income net income was 6904 million in fiscal 2006 6097 million in fiscal 2005 and 6094 million in fiscal 2004 net income per share was 141 in fiscal 2006 121 in fiscal 2005 and 116 in fiscal 2004 

  net income for fiscal 2006 was favorably impacted by a tax benefit of 47 million or 10 per share due to the repatriation of foreign earnings as well as a tax benefit of 22 million or 04 per share relating to the correction of a previously established deferred tax liability net income for fiscal 2006 was adversely impacted by approximately 12 million or 02 per share due to the third quarter events these third quarter events included the aftertax cost of executive resignation agreements primarily with respect to our former ceo 5 million ecommerce exit costs and third quarter operating losses 6 million and uninsured losses due to hurricanes in the third quarter including the estimated impact of lost sales 6 million all of which were partially offset by a gain from a visamastercard antitrust litigation settlement 5 million operating losses of the ecommerce operation in the first six months of fiscal 2006 were largely offset by fiscal 2005 start up costs and a fourth quarter operating loss in fiscal 2005 

  net income for fiscal 2005 was reduced by 193 million or 04 per share as a result of the aftertax effect of the 307 million cumulative pretax noncash charge associated with our lease accounting practices in fiscal 2004 we estimate that the 53rd week added approximately 24 million to net income and 05 to our earnings per share lastly favorable changes in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 added approximately 02 to our earnings per share in each year 

  the change in earnings per share from year to year was favorably impacted by our share repurchase program during fiscal 2006 we repurchased 259 million shares of our stock at a cost of 600 million and in fiscal 2005 we repurchased 251 million shares at a cost of 588 million we plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2007 with planned purchases of approximately 650 million 

18   trends improved in the fourth quarter with significant increases in net income and earnings per share compared to the prior year reported net income was 2887 million up 75 over the prior year and earnings per share was 60 up 82 over the prior year results for both of these years include certain items that affect the comparability of reported results the chart below shows the effect of these items on fourth quarter net income and earnings per share 

   excluding these onetime items fourth quarter net income was 220 million up 19 and earnings per share was 46 up 24 results were driven by same store sales growth of 3 as well as by decreases in cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs and selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales the reduction in the cost of sales ratio was due to improved merchandise margins with reduced levels of markdowns at our winners homegoods and aj wright divisions being the major factors the reduction in the selling general and administrative expense ratio was due to a decrease in store payroll and other store costs as a percentage of net sales 

  segment information the following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments we consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income before general corporate expense and interest expense net “segment profit or loss” as defined by tjx may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities in addition this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity more detailed information about our segments including a reconciliation of “segment profit or loss” to “income before provision for income taxes” can be found in note n to the consolidated financial statements 

  segment profit or loss for fiscal 2005 includes each segment’s share of the cumulative pretax charge relating to lease accounting see note a to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “lease accounting” also segment profit for the current year and all prior periods include the effect of the adoption of sfas no 123r 

  segment profit for fiscal 2006 was positively impacted by the strong fourth quarter in which every division increased its segment profit or decreased its segment loss compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year 

marmaxx 

   marmaxx posted a 2 same store sales increase in fiscal 2006 compared to a 4 increase in same store sales for fiscal 2005 same store sales growth in fiscal 2006 was driven by strong sales in the jewelry accessories and footwear categories while same store sales for home fashions and women’s sportswear were below the chain average same store sales in fiscal 2005 also reflected strong sales in the jewelry accessories and footwear categories as well as women’s sportswear same store sales in both years benefited from the continuation of the marmaxx program whereby certain 

19 departments in the tj maxx and marshalls stores were expanded marmaxx ended fiscal 2006 with 594 tj maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 146 marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments as compared to 303 tj maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 67 marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments at the end of fiscal 2005 these initiatives were significant factors in marmaxx’s overall same store sales results particularly in fiscal 2005 when sales in the stores with the expanded departments were above the chain average geographically in fiscal 2006 florida the southwest and the west coast all performed above the chain average while the northeast and the midwest performed below the chain average 

  segment profit as a percentage of net sales “segment margin” decreased to 90 in fiscal 2006 from 94 in fiscal 2005 the decline in the fiscal 2006 segment margin was largely driven by the delevering impact of a 2 same store sales increase which impacted operating expense ratios primarily occupancy costs which increased 3 as a percentage of sales and distribution center costs which increased 1 as a percentage of sales in addition the certain third quarter events described earlier ecommerce and hurricane related losses offset in part by the gain from the visa mastercard settlement reduced segment margin in fiscal 2006 by 1 the comparison to the fiscal 2005 margin is favorably impacted by the inclusion in last year’s segment profit of a 168 million charge for the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment which reduced fiscal 2005 segment profit margin by 2 merchandise margin for fiscal 2006 was essentially flat compared to fiscal 2005 despite fuel related increases in freight costs as of january 28 2006 average inventories per store were down 10 compared to the prior year primarily due to reduced inventory levels on hand at the distribution centers 

  segment margin increased in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 despite the impact of the lease accounting charge described above in fiscal 2005 marmaxx executed its merchandising and inventory strategies effectively which led to strong markon and improved merchandise margins which increased 4 marmaxx also effectively managed expenses in fiscal 2005 these improvements in segment profit margin were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs of 3 as a percentage of sales 2 of which represents the impact of the lease accounting charge segment profit and segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 are also impacted by the benefit of the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 reporting period the 53rd week in fiscal 2004 had an estimated favorable impact of 2 on the segment profit margin for that year as the sales volume from this extra week helped to lever certain fixed costs 

  we added a net of 46 new stores tj maxx or marshalls in fiscal 2006 and increased total selling square footage of the division by 4 we expect to open 50 new stores net of closings in fiscal 2007 increasing the marmaxx store base by 3 and increasing its selling square footage by 4 we plan to add approximately 99 expanded jewelry and accessories departments in existing and new tj maxx stores and to add approximately 130 expanded footwear departments in existing and new marshalls stores 

winners and homesense 

   net sales for winners and homesense our canadian businesses for fiscal 2006 increased by 13 over fiscal 2005 with approximately half of this growth due to currency exchange rates same store sales in local currency decreased by 3 in fiscal 2006 and increased by 4 in fiscal 2005 same store sales for fiscal 2006 were adversely impacted by a decline 

20 in the average unit selling price same store sales were also impacted by lower clearance sales volume primarily in the second half of the year as winners’ perstore inventories were significantly below the prior year due to improved inventory management at the end of fiscal 2006 average perstore inventories were down 6 compared to the prior year same store sales were also negatively impacted by declines in the women’s sportswear and home fashion categories 

  segment profit margin improved by 5 compared to fiscal 2005 this improvement was primarily due to a 29 increase in merchandise margins which were driven by improved inventory management resulting in reduced clearance sales and lower markdowns the increase in merchandise margin was partially offset by the delevering impact of the 3 decline in same store sales expense ratios increased across most categories with a 14 increase in occupancy and distribution costs being the most significant incremental costs associated with three store closings in fiscal 2006 also impacted segment profit the comparison of segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 is also favorably impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal 2005 segment profit of a 35 million charge for this division’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment 

  the growth in winners segment profit in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 was due to favorable currency exchange rates the segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 of 78 was 14 below fiscal 2004 primarily due to lower merchandise margins which decreased 9 from the prior year primarily driven by markdowns sales in the second half of fiscal 2005 slowed considerably from the first half due to unseasonable weather and a promotional retail environment this combined with winners’ aggressive buying based on the strength of its firsthalf sales resulted in excess inventories requiring the division to take aggressive markdowns to clear merchandise in the second half of the year negatively impacting segment profit margin the lease accounting charge reduced segment profit margin by 2 in fiscal 2005 

  the change in segment profit margin for both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 was negatively impacted by the growth of the company’s homesense business which is at an earlier stage of development than the core winners business and therefore operates with higher expense ratios 

  we added a net of 6 winners stores and 18 homesense stores in fiscal 2006 and expanded selling square footage in canada by 12 we expect to add a net of 11 winners and 10 homesense stores in fiscal 2007 increasing our total canadian store base by 9 and increasing selling square footage by 8 the store counts include the winners portion and homesense portion of this division’s superstores which either combine a winners store with a homesense store or operates them sidebyside as of january 28 2006 we operated 22 of these superstores and expect to have a total of 29 superstores at the end of fiscal 2007 

tk maxx 

   net sales in fiscal 2006 for tk maxx operating in the united kingdom and ireland increased by 16 over fiscal 2005 tk maxx had a same store sales increase of 1 in local currency in fiscal 2006 on top of a 3 increase in fiscal 2005 tk maxx’s same store sales in fiscal 2006 were negatively impacted by a weak retail environment in the united kingdom as well as unseasonably warm weather early in the year women’s sportswear and footwear categories were below the chain average while sales of home fashions were strong 

  segment profit margin declined 3 to 46 of sales tk maxx had an improved merchandise margin in fiscal 2006 primarily due to lower markdowns in addition the comparison of segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2005 is favorably impacted by the inclusion in the fiscal 2005 segment profit of this division’s share of the 

21 cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment of 65 million these improvements however were more than offset by an increase in occupancy expense due to higher cost for rent utilities and property taxes as well as the delevering impact of a 1 same store sales increase distribution and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were essentially flat compared to fiscal 2005 despite the low same store sales increase 

  tk maxx’s operating results for fiscal 2005 were adversely affected by unseasonable weather patterns in the first half of the year and a highly promotional retail environment in the latter half of the year in light of the retail environment under which tk maxx operated in fiscal 2005 this division was effective in managing inventories and expenses to minimize the impact on segment profit margins segment profit and segment margin for fiscal 2005 include a 65 million charge for tk maxx’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment the significant growth in tk maxx’s segment profit in fiscal 2005 is attributable to the increase in sales as well as the favorable benefit of foreign currency exchange rates the segment profit margin in fiscal 2005 decreased 5 to 49 primarily due to an increase in occupancy costs of 7 as a percentage of sales of which 5 was attributable to the cumulative lease accounting charge 

  we added 27 new tk maxx stores in fiscal 2006 and increased the division’s selling square footage by 21 we plan to open an additional 15 tk maxx stores in fiscal 2007 and expand selling square footage by 10 

homegoods 

   homegoods’ same store sales grew 1 in both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 customer transactions and unit sales increased at homegoods during fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 but these increases were partially offset by a decline in the average ticket resulting from planned changes to the merchandise mix segment profit increased to 284 million from 181 million and segment profit margin increased to 24 of sales from 18 of sales in the prior year the increase in segment profit margin resulted primarily from an increase in merchandise margin lower markdowns partially offset by the impact of higher freight costs as well as the impact on prior year results of the cumulative lease accounting charge of 22 million homegoods fourth quarter same store sales and operating results were particularly strong the strength of homegoods fourth quarter more than offset unfavorable factors to segment profit and margin for fiscal 2006 including the delevering impact of the 1 same store sales increase ecommerce operating loss of 37 million and approximately 2 million of costs related to the planned closing of a distribution center 

  segment profit in fiscal 2005 declined to 181 million from 454 million in the prior year the business was adversely affected by weaker retail demand for home fashion product as well as an unfavorable merchandise mix which led to a 1 same store sales increase the business also took additional markdowns which led to a reduction in its merchandise margin the decline in segment profit margin from 52 in fiscal 2004 to 18 in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to this reduction in merchandise margin segment profit in fiscal 2005 also included a charge for 22 million for homegoods’ share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment segment profit margin was also impacted by increases in occupancy costs and distribution center costs as a percentage of net sales these expense ratio increases reflect the delevering impact on expense ratios of a 1 same store sales increase 

  we opened a net of 35 homegoods stores in fiscal 2006 a 16 increase and increased selling square footage of the division by 17 in fiscal 2007 we plan to add a net of 10 homegoods stores 15 new less 5 closings and increase selling square footage by 5 reflecting our plan to slow the pace of store openings for this division 

22 aj wright 

   aj wright’s same store sales increased 3 for fiscal 2006 compared to a 4 increase in same store sales for fiscal 2005 aj wright’s segment loss for fiscal 2006 was narrowed to 22 million from 196 million in fiscal 2005 this improvement was driven by improved merchandise margin primarily the result of lower markdowns in fiscal 2006 the comparison to fiscal 2005 is also impacted by the inclusion of a 17 million charge in fiscal 2005 for its share of the lease accounting adjustment in fiscal 2006 effective expense control also led to a reduction in expenses as a percentage of sales across most expense categories primarily in advertising and store payroll and benefits we reduced the number of our new store openings for aj wright in fiscal 2006 as we believe that the pace of store openings in fiscal 2005 may have been too aggressive for this young division placing a strain on operations 

  aj wright’s segment loss grew to 196 million in fiscal 2005 from 21 million in fiscal 2004 we believe that the aj wright customer is more sensitive to economic factors such as higher energy costs and that such factors along with a weaker demand in urban fashion trends impacted sales in fiscal 2005 these sales trends caused us to take higher markdowns to clear inventories and to reposition our merchandise mix segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 reflected a reduction in merchandise margins of 12 primarily due to this higher markdown activity in addition the lowerthan planned sales volume for fiscal 2005 negatively impacted expense ratios for occupancy costs distribution center costs and store payroll distribution center costs were also impacted by expense increases relating to aj wright’s new distribution facility in indiana segment loss for fiscal 2005 also included a 17 million charge for aj wright’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment 

  we added 22 new aj wright stores in fiscal 2006 increasing selling square footage by 17 in fiscal 2007 we plan to add a net of 8 new stores 10 new stores less 2 closings and increase selling square footage by 5 reflecting our plan to slow the pace of new store openings 

bob’s stores 

   fiscal 2005 was the first full fiscal year for bob’s stores as a tjx division bob’s stores operated 35 stores as of the end of fiscal 2006 net sales for fiscal 2006 were less than the prior year primarily due to a reduction in the number of promotional advertising circulars although merchandise margin improved in fiscal 2006 due to lower promotional markdowns the sales decline and incremental operating costs resulted in an increased segment loss for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 segment loss in fiscal 2006 also includes severance costs of 08 million in connection with a reduction in the work force at bob’s stores for fiscal 2007 we plan to open 1 bob’s store we are in the process of implementing new strategies for bob’s with the goal of reducing its segment loss in fiscal 2007 

23 general corporate expense 

   general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments this item includes the costs of the corporate office including the compensation and benefits including stock based compensation for senior corporate management payroll and operating costs of the corporate departments of accounting and budgeting internal audit treasury investor relations tax risk management legal human resources and systems and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff in addition general corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing retirees and nonoperating costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions general corporate expense is included in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 

  the increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 is primarily due to the costs associated with executive resignation agreements 9 million and of exiting the ecommerce business of 6 million both of these items occurred in our third quarter period ended october 29 2005 in addition general corporate expense includes a charge 4 million in connection with an idle leased facility 

  the increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2005 over the prior year reflects the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses the majority of which relates to derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency exposures on intercompany activity in addition general corporate expense for fiscal 2005 reflects an increase in general corporate overhead incremental audit fees and costs related to the startup of our ecommerce businesses this increase was offset in part by a 63 million reduction in contributions to the tjx foundation in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities 

  net cash provided by operating activities was 11580 million in fiscal 2006 10768 million in fiscal 2005 and 7679 million in fiscal 2004 the cash generated from operating activities in each of these fiscal years was largely due to operating earnings net income adjusted for noncash items was essentially the same in each year the difference in net cash provided from operating activities from year to year was largely driven by the change in inventory net of accounts payable from prior yearend levels in fiscal 2006 this change in net inventory position resulted in a source of cash of 262 million compared to a use of cash of 853 million in fiscal 2005 and 1918 million in fiscal 2004 this trend is largely explained by our average per store inventory levels at each yearend period average per store inventories at january 28 2006 including inventory on hand at our distribution centers decreased 11 compared to the prior year and at january 29 2005 they increased 1 compared to the prior year this compares to inventories per store at january 31 2004 that were up 11 compared to the prior year effective with the third quarter ended october 30 2004 we began to accrue for inventory obligations at the time inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by tjx this accrual increased inventory by 341 million as of january 28 2006 and by 237 million as of january 29 2005 along with a comparable increase to our accounts payable and thus had no impact on cash flows from operations 

  the cash flows from operating activities for both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 were also impacted by increases in accrued expenses and other liabilities in each year accrued expenses and other liabilities increased in each year in part due to higher liabilities for rent gift cards and payroll and benefits in addition fiscal 2005 was impacted by an increase in deferred landlord allowances cash flows from operating activities were reduced by contributions to our qualified pension fund of 40 million in fiscal 2006 250 million in fiscal 2005 and 175 million in fiscal 2004 all of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 were made on a voluntary basis 

  discontinued operations reserve we have a reserve for potential future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases of former tjx businesses the reserve reflects tjx’s estimation of its cost for claims updated quarterly that have been or are likely to be made against tjx for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of 

24 the leases of these businesses after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations at january 28 2006 substantially all leases of discontinued operations that were rejected in bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against tjx had been resolved although tjx’s actual costs with respect to any of these leases may exceed amounts estimated in our reserve and tjx may incur costs for leases from these discontinued operations that were not terminated or had not expired tjx does not expect to incur any material costs related to discontinued operations in excess of the reserve the reserve balance amounted to 150 million as of january 28 2006 124 million as of january 29 2005 and 175 million as of january 31 2004 during fiscal 2006 tjx received creditor recoveries of 85 million offset by equivalent additions to the reserve to reflect adjustments to the reserve during the year any additional creditor recoveries are expected to be immaterial 

  we may also be contingently liable on up to 18 leases of bj’s wholesale club another former tjx business for which bj’s wholesale club is primarily liable our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to tjx with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of bj’s wholesale club 

  offbalance sheet liabilities we have contingent obligations on leases for which we were a lessee or guarantor which were assigned to third parties without tjx being released by the landlords over many years we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties with the exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed above we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases and accordingly we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them 

  we also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate we estimate the undiscounted obligations not reflected in our reserves of leases of closed stores of continuing operations bj’s wholesale club leases discussed above and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations is approximately 100 million as of january 28 2006 we believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to tjx and to the extent they do will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors 

  we are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold specified environmental matters or certain income taxes these obligations are typically limited in time and amount there are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations 

investing activities 

our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table below 

   we expect that capital expenditures will approximate 395 million for fiscal 2007 this includes 115 million for new stores 226 million for store renovations expansions and improvements and 54 million for our office and distribution centers the planned decrease in capital expenditures is attributable to fewer new store openings primarily at homegoods aj wright and tk maxx as well as lower capital spending across most other areas of our business 

25 financing activities 

  cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 5037 million in fiscal 2006 5846 million in fiscal 2005 and 5443 million in fiscal 2004 the majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program 

  we spent 6037 million in fiscal 2006 5946 million in fiscal 2005 and 5207 million in fiscal 2004 under our stock repurchase programs we repurchased 259 million shares in fiscal 2006 251 million shares in fiscal 2005 and 268 million shares in fiscal 2004 all shares repurchased were retired during fiscal 2006 we completed a 1 billion stock repurchase program and announced our intention to repurchase an additional 1 billion of common stock under the new 1 billion stock repurchase program we repurchased 03 million shares at a total cost of 66 million through january 28 2006 

  in january 2006 winners entered into a c235 million us2044 nonrevolving term credit facility due in january 2009 and guaranteed by tjx interest is payable at rates equal to or less than the canadian prime rate winners entered into an interest rate swap agreement which effectively establishes a fixed rate of approximately 45 on this debt the proceeds were used to fund the repatriation of winners earnings to tjx as well as other general corporate purposes of this division financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on longterm debt of 100 million in fiscal 2006 5 million in fiscal 2005 and 15 million in fiscal 2004 

  we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 24 per share in fiscal 2006 18 per share in fiscal 2005 and 14 per share in fiscal 2004 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 1053 million in fiscal 2006 834 million in fiscal 2005 and 689 million in fiscal 2004 financing activities also include proceeds of 1024 million in fiscal 2006 969 million in fiscal 2005 and 592 million in fiscal 2004 from the exercise of employee stock options 

  we traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of shortterm commercial paper in may 2005 we entered into a 500 million fouryear revolving credit facility and a 500 million fiveyear revolving credit facility these arrangements replaced our 370 million fiveyear revolving credit facility entered into in march 2002 and our 330 million 364day revolving credit facility which had been extended through july 15 2005 the new agreements have no compensating balance requirements and have various covenants including a requirement of a specified ratio of debt to earnings these agreements serve as back up to our commercial paper program as of january 28 2006 there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities the maximum amount of our us shortterm borrowings outstanding was 567 million during fiscal 2006 5 million during fiscal 2005 and 27 million during fiscal 2004 the weighted average interest rate on our us shortterm borrowings was 369 in fiscal 2006 204 in fiscal 2005 and 109 in fiscal 2004 

  as of january 28 2006 winners had credit lines totaling c20 million c10 million to meet certain operating needs and c10 million letter of credit facility there were credit lines totaling c20 million at both january 29 2005 and january 31 2004 respectively the maximum amount outstanding under our canadian credit lines was c46 million in fiscal 2006 c68 million in fiscal 2005 and c56 million in fiscal 2004 as of january 28 2006 tk maxx had a £2 million credit line to meet certain operating needs the maximum amount outstanding in fiscal 2006 was £17 million on this line there were no outstanding borrowings on either of these credit lines as of january 28 2006 

  we believe that our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs see note c to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our longterm debt and available financing sources 

26   contractual obligations as of january 28 2006 we had payment obligations including current installments under longterm debt arrangements leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows in thousands 

 the longterm debt obligations above includes estimated interest costs and assumes that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put option in fiscal 2008 the note holders also have a put option available to them in fiscal 2014 if none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted the notes will mature in fiscal 2022 the effect of the interest rate swap agreements was estimated based on their values as of january 28 2006 

  the lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay these costs were approximately onethird of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended january 28 2006 

  our purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for merchandise purchase orders for capital expenditures supplies and other operating needs commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services and commitments under executive employment agreements we excluded longterm agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty 

  we also have longterm liabilities which includes 1387 million for employee compensation and benefits most of which will come due beyond five years derivative contracts of approximately 100 million the majority of which comes due in fiscal 2010 and 1332 million for accrued rent the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table 

critical accounting policies 

  tjx must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to inventory valuation retirement obligations casualty insurance and accounting for taxes we believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained had alternative assumptions been selected would not be materially different from the results we have reported 

  inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory on a firstin firstout basis under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costto retail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory this method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage a significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods in addition as a normal business practice we have a very specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing the need for management estimates inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but is based on a full physical inventory at fiscal year end thus the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results but is not a factor in full year results overall we believe that the retail method coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated lastly many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions which ultimately affect the 

27 value of the inventory our offprice businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors bob’s stores the valueoriented retailer we acquired in december 2003 does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain conditions are met these arrangements do have some impact on bob’s inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results 

  retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates we are required to make assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the longterm rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period the discount rate which we determine annually based on market interest rates has dropped over the past several years and our actual returns on pension assets for fiscal 2006 and for several years prior to fiscal 2004 were considerably less than our expected returns these two factors can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and in recent years have had an unfavorable effect on the funded status of our qualified pension plan we have made contributions of 825 million which exceeded the minimum required over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan 

  casualty insurance tjx’s casualty insurance program requires tjx to estimate the total claims it will incur as a component of its annual insurance cost the estimated claims are developed with the assistance of an actuary based on historical experience and other factors these estimates involve significant estimates and assumptions and actual results could differ from these estimates if tjx’s estimate for the claims component of its casualty insurance expense for fiscal 2006 were to change by 10 the fiscal 2006 pretax cost would increase or decrease by approximately 55 million a large portion of these claims are funded with a nonrefundable payment during the policy year offsetting our estimated claims accrual the company has a net accrual of 347 million for the unfunded portion of its casualty insurance program as of january 28 2006 

  accounting for taxes like many large corporations we are regularly under audit by the united states federal state local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions we accrue charges for possible exposures based on the annual evaluations of tax positions we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted the internal revenue service has examined the fiscal years ended january 2000 through january 2003 and several proposed adjustments are under appeal we also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process 

recent accounting pronouncements 

  in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r which requires that the cost of all employee stock options as well as other equitybased compensation arrangements be reflected in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date with limited exceptions that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period usually the vesting period tjx adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and elected the modified retrospective transition method accordingly all prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the impact of sfas no 123r in amounts equal to the pro forma results presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

  in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs” which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage by requiring these items to be recognized as currentperiod charges sfas no 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 with earlier application permitted we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have any material impact on our financial statements 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets” an amendment of apb opinion no 29 this statement addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets it eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21b of 

28 apb 29 and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance we adopted sfas no 153 in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 which did not have a material impact on our financial statements 

  in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections” a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3 sfas no 154 changes the requirements for accounting and reporting a change in accounting principle the statement requires retrospective application of a voluntary change in accounting principle to prior period financial statements rather than recording the cumulative effect of the change in net earnings in the current period sfas no 154 also strictly defines the term “restatement” to mean the correction of an error by revising previously issued financial statements sfas no 154 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 fiscal 2007 for tjx we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 154 to have a material effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

  in june 2005 the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 0506 “determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements” “eitf 0506” eitf 0506 provides guidance for determining the amortization period used for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased after the inception of a lease collectively referred to as subsequently acquired leasehold improvements eitf 0506 provides that the amortization period used for the subsequently acquired leasehold improvements to be the lesser of a the subsequently acquired leasehold improvements’ useful lives or b a period that reflects renewals that are reasonably assured upon the acquisition or the purchase eitf 0506 is effective on a prospective basis for subsequently acquired leasehold improvements purchased or acquired in periods beginning after the date of the fasb’s ratification which was on june 29 2005 the adoption of eitf 0506 did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

  financial accounting standards board interpretation no 47 fin 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” was issued in march 2005 this interpretation provides clarification with respect to the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets when the timing andor method of settlement of the obligation is conditional on a future event this interpretation requires that the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it occurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made we have determined that conditional legal obligations exist for certain of our leased facilities primarily our distribution centers the asset retirement obligation and the annual cost reflected in these financials is immaterial 

market risk 

  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our canadian winners and homesense and european tk maxx operations as more fully described in notes a and d to the consolidated financial statements we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations intercompany transactions with these operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations with derivative financial instruments we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we do not enter into derivatives for speculative trading purposes 

  we are also subject to interest rate risk under the terms of our revolving credit line which has variable rate of interest the impact on our future interest expense as a result of future changes in interest rates will depend largely on the gross amount of our borrowings 

  in addition the assets of our qualified pension plan a large portion of which is invested in equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market we allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend   we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our canadian winners and homesense and european tk maxx operations as more fully described in notes a and d to the consolidated financial statements we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations intercompany transactions with these operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations with derivative financial instruments we enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures most of these gains and losses are recorded directly in shareholders’ equity the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of january 28 2006 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  our cash equivalents and shortterm investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by the company we occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing however we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions 

  we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year as of january 28 2006 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 1 business tableend   we are the leading offprice retailer of apparel and home fashions in the united states and worldwide our seven offprice chains are synergistic in their philosophies and operating platforms we sell offprice family apparel and home fashions through our tj maxx marshalls and aj wright chains in the united states our winners chain in canada and our tk maxx chain in the united kingdom and ireland we sell offprice home fashions through our homegoods chain in the united states and our canadian homesense chain operated by winners the target customer for all of our offprice chains except aj wright is the middle to uppermiddle income shopper with the same profile as a department or specialty store customer aj wright targets the moderate income customer bob’s stores acquired in december 2003 is a valueoriented branded apparel chain based in the northeast united states that offers casual family apparel bob’s stores’ target customer demographic spans the moderate to uppermiddle income bracket 

  our offprice mission is to deliver an exciting fresh and rapidly changing assortment of brandname merchandise at excellent values to our customers we define value as the combination of quality brand fashion and price with over 400 buyers and over 10000 vendors worldwide and over 2200 stores we believe we are well positioned to continue accomplishing this goal our key strengths include 

   as an offprice retailer we offer quality name brand and designer family apparel and home fashions every day at substantial savings from comparable department and specialty store regular prices we can offer these everyday savings as a result of our opportunistic buying strategies disciplined inventory management including rapid inventory turns and low expense structure 

  in our offprice concepts we purchase the majority of our inventory opportunistically different from traditional retailers that order goods far in advance of the time they appear on the selling floor tjx buyers are in the marketplace virtually every week by maintaining a liquid inventory position our buyers can buy close to need enabling them to buy into current market trends and take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace due to the unpredictable nature of consumer demand in the marketplace and the mismatch of supply and demand we are regularly able to buy the vast majority of our inventory directly from manufacturers with some merchandise coming from retailers and others virtually all of our buys for our offprice concepts are made at discounts from initial wholesale prices we generally purchase merchandise to sell in the current selling season with a limited quantity of packaway merchandise that we buy specifically to warehouse and sell in a future selling season we are willing to purchase less than a full assortment of styles and sizes we pay promptly and do not ask for typical retail concessions in our offprice chains such as advertising promotional and markdown allowances or delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries our financial strength strong reputation and ability to sell large quantities of merchandise through a geographically diverse network of stores provide us excellent access to leading branded merchandise our opportunistic buying permits us to consistently offer our customers a rapidly changing merchandise assortment at everyday values that are below department and specialty store regular prices 

  we are extremely disciplined in our inventory management and we rapidly turn the inventory in our offprice chains we rely heavily on sophisticated internally developed inventory systems and controls that permit a virtually continuous flow of merchandise into our stores and an expansive distribution infrastructure that supports our closetoneed buying by delivering goods to our stores quickly and efficiently for example highly automated storage and distribution systems track allocate and deliver an average of 11000 items per week to each tj maxx and marshalls store in addition specialized computer inventory planning purchasing and monitoring systems coupled with warehouse storage processing handling and shipping systems permit a continuous evaluation and rapid replenishment of store inventory pricing markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment requirements are determined 

2 centrally using satellitetransmitted information provided by pointofsale computer terminals and are designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner these inventory management and distribution systems allow us to achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of product and sell substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods 

  we operate with a low cost structure relative to many other retailers while we seek to provide a pleasant easy shopping environment with emphasis on customer convenience we do not spend large amounts on store fixtures our selling floor space is flexible and largely free of permanent fixtures so we can easily expand and contract departments in response to customer demand and available merchandise also our large presence strong financial position and expertise in the real estate market allow us to obtain favorable lease terms in our offprice concepts our advertising budget as a percentage of sales is low compared to traditional department and specialty stores with our advertising focused on awareness of shopping at our stores rather than promoting particular merchandise our high salespersquarefoot productivity and rapid inventory turnover also provide expense efficiencies 

  with all of our offprice chains operating with the same offprice strategies and systems we are able to capitalize upon expertise and best practices across our chains develop associates by transferring them from one chain to another and grow our various businesses more efficiently and effectively 

  during the fiscal year ended january 29 2005 we derived 814 of our sales from the united states 301 from the northeast 145 from the midwest 231 from the south 08 from the central plains and 129 from the west 86 from canada 88 from europe specifically in the united kingdom and ireland and 12 from puerto rico 

  we consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment the tj maxx and marshalls store chains are managed as one division referred to as marmaxx and are reported as a single segment the winners and homesense chains which operate exclusively in canada are also managed as one division and are reported as a single segment each of our other store chains tk maxx homegoods aj wright and bob’s stores are reported as separate segments more detailed information about our segments can be found in note n to the consolidated financial statements

  tj maxx is the largest offprice retail chain in the united states with 771 stores in 48 states marshalls is the secondlargest offprice retailer in the united states with 683 stores in 42 states as well as 14 stores in puerto rico we maintain the separate identities of the tj maxx and marshalls stores through product assortment and merchandising marketing and store appearance this encourages our customers to shop at both chains 

  tj maxx and marshalls primarily target female shoppers who have families with middle to uppermiddle incomes and who generally fit the profile of a department or specialty store customer these chains operate with a common buying and merchandising organization and have consolidated administrative functions including finance and human resources the combined organization known internally as the marmaxx group offers us increased leverage to purchase merchandise at favorable prices and allows us to operate with a lower cost structure these advantages are key to our ability to sell quality brand name merchandise at substantial discounts from department and specialty store regular prices 

  tj maxx and marshalls sell quality brand name merchandise at prices generally 2060 below department and specialty store regular prices both chains offer family apparel accessories giftware and home fashions within these broad categories tj maxx offers a shoe assortment for women and fine jewelry while marshalls offers a fullline footwear department and a larger men’s department in fiscal 2005 tj maxx continued to roll out expanded jewelry and accessories departments and marshalls continued to add expanded footwear departments based on customers’ enthusiastic response to our testing these expanded departments in fiscal 

3 2004 we believe these expanded offerings further differentiate the shopping experience at tj maxx and marshalls driving traffic to both chains and we expect to continue rolling out these expanded departments

competition 

  the retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive our customers focus upon fashion quality price merchandise selection and freshness brand name recognition and to a lesser degree store location we compete with local regional and national department specialty and offprice stores we also compete to some degree with any retailer that sells apparel and home fashions in stores through catalogues or over the internet we purchase most of our inventory opportunistically and compete for that merchandise with other national and regional offprice apparel and outlet stores we also compete with other retailers for store locations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of tableend financial condition and results of operations 

  the following discussion contains forwardlooking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements due to various factors including those discussed in item 1 of this report under the section entitled “safe harbor statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995” 

results of operations 

  overview our financial performance for the 52week fiscal year ended january 29 2005 fiscal 2005 as compared to our 53week fiscal year ended january 31 2004 fiscal 2004 is summarized below 

   the following is a summary of the operating results of tjx at the consolidated level this discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment all references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise indicated and diluted earnings per share for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the new accounting rules relating to our contingently convertible debt see note a to our consolidated financial statements 

  net sales net sales for tjx for our fiscal year ended january 29 2005 totaled 149 billion an 119 increase over sales of 133 billion for the fiscal year ended january 31 2004 our reporting period for fiscal 2004 included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in both fiscal 2005 and the fiscal year ended january 25 2003 fiscal 2003 the 53rd week in fiscal 2004 added incremental 

14 sales of approximately 200 million as compared to fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2003 the net sales for fiscal 2004 of 133 billion represented an 112 increase over sales of 120 billion for our fiscal year ended january 25 2003 

  the 12 increase in net sales for fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 reflects approximately 6 from new stores 5 from same store sales growth and 2 from the acquisition of bob’s stores partially offset by approximately a 1 reduction to the growth rate due to fiscal 2005 having one less week than fiscal 2004 bob’s stores was acquired on december 24 2003 and our sales results for fiscal 2004 include bob’s stores from the date of acquisition as compared to a full year for fiscal 2005 the 11 increase in net sales for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 includes approximately 8 from new stores 1 from same store sales growth with the balance primarily due to the 53rd week sales growth in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates 

  new stores are our major source of sales growth our consolidated store count increased by 79 in fiscal 2005 and 102 in fiscal 2004 over the respective prior year period our selling square footage increased by 82 in fiscal 2005 and 96 in fiscal 2004 in each case over the prior year bob’s stores is excluded from fiscal 2004 store count and selling square footage calculations as it was acquired late in fiscal 2004 our acquisition of bob’s stores on december 24 2003 added 31 units as of the end of fiscal 2004 net sales for bob’s stores are included in our results from the date of acquisition we expect to add 161 stores net of store closings in the fiscal year ending january 28 2006 fiscal 2006 a 7 projected increase in our consolidated store base and we expect to increase our selling square footage base by 8 

  net sales for fiscal 2005 reflect strong demand for jewelry and accessories women’s apparel and footwear partially offset by weaker demand for men’s apparel and home fashions the 5 growth in consolidated same store sales for fiscal 2005 over the prior year was driven by a 4 same store sales increase at marmaxx marmaxx continued its program of expanding certain departments in its stores and ended the year with 303 tj maxx stores with expanded jewelryaccessories departments and 67 marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments these initiatives were significant factors in marmaxx achieving a 4 same store sales increase in fiscal 2005 consolidated same store sales growth of 1 in fiscal 2004 reflects the impact of unseasonable weather in the first half of that year same store sales growth in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 benefited by approximately 1 1  2 percentage points from foreign currency exchange rates 

  we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and stores that are increased in size are generally classified in the same way as the original store and we believe that the impact of these stores on the same store percentage is immaterial consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in us dollars we also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of their operating performance 

  the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales 

   cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 763 in fiscal 2005 756 in fiscal 2004 and 758 in fiscal 2003 our consolidated merchandise margin was essentially flat to the prior year throughout fiscal 2005 the marmaxx division continued to effectively execute our merchandising and inventory management strategies maintaining a liquid inventory position and buying close to need all of which led to improved 

15 merchandise margin at this division however this improved merchandise margin at marmaxx in fiscal 2005 was offset by reduced merchandise margin at our other divisions most of which experienced higher markdowns the increase in this ratio in fiscal 2005 includes a 2 increase due to a 307 million noncash charge 193 million aftertax to conform our lease accounting practices to generally accepted accounting principles see note a to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “lease accounting” this ratio in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 also reflects an increase of approximately 2 due to the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2005 as the sales volume from the extra week helped lever certain fixed costs in fiscal 2004 the balance of the increase in the ratio in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to higher cost of sales ratios at divisions other than marmaxx which represent a greater proportion of the consolidated results in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 

  the improvement in the cost of sales ratio in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 reflects a significant improvement in merchandise margin primarily in the second half of fiscal 2004 the improved merchandise margin contributed to an approximate 6 reduction in our consolidated cost of sales ratio successful execution of our inventory and merchandising strategies and buying closer to need led to this improvement the contribution from improved merchandise margin was partially offset by higher store occupancy costs as a percentage of sales due to lowerthanplanned same store sales growth and higher distribution costs as a result of opening our new tj maxx distribution facility in pittston pennsylvania store occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales increased by 3 for fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales increased by 1 the cost of sales ratio was favorably impacted by the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 reporting period estimated to be a 2 improvement in this ratio as the sales volume from this extra week helped lever certain fixed costs 

  selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 163 in fiscal 2005 and 162 in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 the increase in this ratio in fiscal 2005 was primarily due to a 1 increase in advertising costs as a percentage of sales as a result of the inclusion of bob’s stores for a full fiscal year in our consolidated results bob’s stores operates with a higher advertising cost ratio than our offprice divisions in comparing fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2003 store payroll costs as a percentage of sales increased as a result of the delevering impact of lessthanplanned sales but this increase in the expense ratio was offset by the effect of higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to a pretax 16 million litigation charge the litigation charge was for the estimated cost of settling claims related to four california lawsuits that alleged tjx had improperly classified store managers and assistant store managers as exempt from california overtime laws the lawsuits were settled in fiscal 2004 for slightly less than 16 million 

  interest expense net interest expense net of interest income was 258 million in fiscal 2005 273 million in fiscal 2004 and 254 million in fiscal 2003 interest income was 77 million in fiscal 2005 65 million in fiscal 2004 and 105 million in fiscal 2003 the reduction in interest income in fiscal 2005 and 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates 

  income taxes our effective annual income tax rate was 385 in fiscal 2005 384 in fiscal 2004 and 383 in fiscal 2003 the increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 and the increase in this rate in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 were primarily due to increases in state income tax rates the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2003 also reflects the favorable effect of the tax benefit for payment of executive retirement benefits in exchange for the termination of splitdollar arrangements as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements 

  the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca enacted on october 22 2004 will allow companies to repatriate the undistributed foreign earnings of their foreign operations in fiscal 2006 at an effective rate of 525 the company is evaluating the impact of the act on tjx 

  net income net income was 6641 million in fiscal 2005 6584 million in fiscal 2004 and 5784 million in fiscal 2003 net income per share was 130 in fiscal 2005 125 in fiscal 2004 and 105 in fiscal 2003 diluted earnings per share reflect the impact of retroactive implementation of a new accounting pronouncement that requires the inclusion of shares associated with contingently convertible debt in the calculation of diluted earnings per share even if the contingencies have not been met this accounting change had an adverse effect of 04 on our diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2005 and 03 on previously reported diluted earnings per share in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 net income for fiscal 2005 includes the aftertax effect of the 307 million cumulative pretax charge associated with our lease accounting practices which reduced net income in fiscal 2005 by 193 million or 04 per share we estimate that the 53rd week in fiscal 2004 added approximately 24 million to net income and 05 to our 

16 earnings per share and that favorable changes in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 added approximately 02 to our earnings per share in each year the increase in earnings per share on a percentage basis in all periods increased more than the related earnings as a result of the impact of our share repurchase program during fiscal 2005 we repurchased 251 million shares of our stock at a cost of 588 million and we plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2006 with planned purchases of approximately 600 million 

  segment information the following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments we consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income before general corporate expense and interest expense net “segment profit or loss” as defined by tjx may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities in addition this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity more detailed information about our segments including a reconciliation of “segment profit or loss” to “income before provision for income taxes” can be found in note n to the consolidated financial statements 

  segment profit or loss for fiscal 2005 includes each segment’s share of the cumulative pretax charge relating to lease accounting see note a to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “lease accounting” 

marmaxx 

   marmaxx posted a 4 same store sales increase in fiscal 2005 compared to a 1 decrease in same store sales for fiscal 2004 same store sales growth was driven by strong sales in the jewelry accessories and footwear categories as well as women’s sportswear with fashion trends in these categories helping to drive customer demand sales for men’s apparel and home fashions in fiscal 2005 were soft same store sales benefited from the continuation of the marmaxx program whereby certain departments in the tj maxx and marshalls stores were expanded marmaxx ended fiscal 2005 with 303 tj maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 67 marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments as compared to 5 tj maxx stores with expanded jewelry and accessories departments and 5 marshalls stores with expanded footwear departments at the end of fiscal 2004 these initiatives drove overall sales in the stores with the expanded departments in addition to increasing sales in these categories and were significant factors in marmaxx achieving a 4 same stores sales increase in fiscal 2005 segment profit increased to 98 in fiscal 2005 from 97 in fiscal 2004 despite the impact of a 168 million charge for its share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment the lease accounting charge reduced fiscal 2005 segment profit margin by 2 marmaxx continued to effectively execute its merchandising and inventory strategies aggressively managing the liquidity of its inventory and buying and shipping goods close to need all of which led to strong markon and improved merchandise margins for fiscal 2005 merchandise margins increased 4 marmaxx also continued to effectively manage expenses in fiscal 2005 these improvements in segment profit margin were partially offset by an increase in occupancy costs of 3 as a percentage of sales 2 of which represents the impact of the lease accounting charge segment profit and segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 is also impacted by the benefit of the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 reporting period described below 

  the increase in segment profit and profit margin for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 reflects marmaxx’s sharp execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies and effective expense controls in fiscal 2004 marmaxx was able to buy closer to need in fiscal 2004 leading to a strong markon and an improved merchandise margin especially in the second half of the year the 53rd week in fiscal 2004 had an estimated favorable impact of 2 on the segment profit margin for that year as the sales volume from this 

17 extra week helped lever certain fixed costs the increase in segment profit and segment profit margin in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 also reflect the effect of higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to the 16 million litigation charge discussed above 

  we added a net of 50 new stores tj maxx or marshalls in fiscal 2005 and increased total selling square footage of the division by 4 we expect to open a net of 47 new stores in fiscal 2006 increasing the marmaxx store base by 3 and to increase the selling square footage of the division by 4 we plan to add expanded jewelry and accessories departments in approximately 267 existing tj maxx stores as well as all new tj maxx stores and to add approximately 56 expanded footwear departments in existing and new marshalls stores 

winners and homesense 

   same store sales in local currency for winners and homesense our canadian businesses increased by 4 in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2005 include a 35 million charge for this division’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment the growth in the winners segment profit in fiscal 2005 over the prior year was due to favorable currency exchange rates the segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 of 85 was 14 below fiscal 2004 segment profit margin primarily due to lower merchandise margins which decreased 9 from the prior year primarily driven by markdowns sales in the second half of fiscal 2005 slowed considerably from the first half primarily due to unseasonable weather and a promotional retail environment this along with winners buying based on the strength of its first half sales resulted in excess inventories requiring the division to take aggressive markdowns to clear merchandise in the second half of the year the lease accounting charge reduced segment profit margin by 2 with the balance of the segment profit margin reduction coming largely from the increasing impact of homesense on the division’s combined results homesense is at an earlier stage of development and therefore operates with higher expense ratios than does winners 

  winners and homesense segment profit in fiscal 2004 increased 25 over the segment profit in fiscal 2003 approximately twothirds of the increase in segment profit in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 was due to changes in currency exchange rates winners and homesense segment profit margin for fiscal 2004 was below that of fiscal 2003 this reduction reflects increased markdowns at winners and the increasing impact of homesense on their combined results 

  we opened 8 winners stores and 15 homesense stores in fiscal 2005 and expanded selling square footage in canada by 13 we expect to add a net of 4 winners and 17 homesense stores in fiscal 2006 increasing our total canadian store base by 10 and increasing selling square footage by 10 the store counts include the winners portion and homesense portion of this division’s superstores which either combine a winners store with a homesense store or operates them sidebyside as of january 29 2005 we operated 11 superstores and expect to have a total of 23 superstores at the end of fiscal 2006 

18 tk maxx 

   tk maxx operating in the united kingdom and ireland had a same store sales increase of 3 in local currency in fiscal 2005 on top of a 6 increase in fiscal 2004 tk maxx’s same store sales in fiscal 2005 were adversely affected by unseasonable weather patterns in the first half of the year and a highly promotional retail environment in the latter half of the year in light of the retail environment under which tk maxx operated in fiscal 2005 this division was effective in managing inventories and expenses to minimize the impact on segment profit margins segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2005 include a 65 million charge for tk maxx’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment the significant growth in tk maxx’s segment profit in fiscal 2005 is attributable to the increase in sales as well as the favorable benefit of foreign currency exchange rates the segment profit margin in fiscal 2005 decreased 6 to 54 primarily due to an increase in occupancy costs of 7 as a percentage of sales of which 5 was attributable to the cumulative lease accounting charge 

  segment profit for fiscal 2004 increased 37 over the segment profit for fiscal 2003 with approximately onequarter of this growth coming from currency exchange rates the strong segment performance in fiscal 2004 was driven by tk maxx’s strong execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies 

  we added 23 new tk maxx stores in fiscal 2005 and increased the division’s selling square footage by 23 selling square footage was favorably impacted by the addition of mezzanines in some of our existing stores we plan to open an additional 23 tk maxx stores in fiscal 2006 and expand selling square footage by 20 

homegoods 

   homegoods’ same store sales grew 1 in fiscal 2005 compared to a 1 increase in fiscal 2004 segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales include a 22 million charge for homegoods’ share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment homegoods’ segment profit declined from 498 million in fiscal 2004 to 231 million in fiscal 2005 the business was adversely affected by weaker retail demand for home fashion product as well as an unfavorable merchandise mix which led to a modest 1 same store sales increase consequently the division took additional markdowns which contributed to a 18 reduction in its merchandise margin the decline in segment profit margin from 57 in fiscal 2004 to 23 in fiscal 2005 is primarily due to this reduction in merchandise margin segment profit margin was also impacted by a 9 increase in occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales including 2 due to the lease accounting charge and a 7 increase in distribution center 

19 costs as a percentage of net sales these expense ratio increases reflect the negative impact on expense ratios of a 1 same store sales increase 

  in fiscal 2004 segment profit increased 55 over the segment profit of fiscal 2003 despite only a modest 1 increase in same store sales in fiscal 2004 homegoods’ segment profit margin reflected the solid execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies in fiscal 2004 and a reduction in distribution and administrative expenses as the business expanded over fiscal 2003 

  we opened a net of 34 homegoods stores in fiscal 2005 a 19 increase and increased selling square footage of the division by 17 in fiscal 2006 we plan to add a net of 40 new homegoods stores including freestanding and superstore formats and increase selling square footage by 19 

aj wright 

   aj wright’s same store sales increased 4 for fiscal 2005 compared to an 8 increase in same store sales for fiscal 2004 segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of net sales include a 17 million charge for aj wright’s share of the cumulative impact of the lease accounting adjustment we believe that the aj wright customer is more sensitive to economic factors such as higher energy costs and that this had an impact on the division’s sales performance in fiscal 2005 we also believe that a weaker demand in urban fashion trends impacted sales during the year these sales trends caused us to take higher markdowns to clear inventories and to reposition our merchandise mix segment profit margin for fiscal 2005 reflects a reduction in merchandise margins of 12 primarily due to this higher markdown activity we believe that the pace of store openings in fiscal 2005 especially later in the year may have been too aggressive for this young division and placed a strain on operations in addition the lowerthanplanned sales volume for fiscal 2005 negatively impacted expense ratios for occupancy costs distribution center costs and store payroll distribution center costs were also impacted by expense increases relating to aj wright’s new distribution facility in indiana 

  in fiscal 2004 the improvement in aj wright’s segment profit as compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the impact of improved merchandising and strong inventory management which led to improved merchandise margins segment profit for fiscal 2004 also included a 17 million gain in connection with an agreement to vacate a store property 

  we added 31 new aj wright stores in fiscal 2005 increasing selling square footage by 32 in fiscal 2006 we plan to add 25 new stores and increase selling square footage by 20 

bob’s stores 

  fiscal 2005 was the first full fiscal year for bob’s stores as a tjx division bob’s stores now operates 32 stores and recorded fiscal 2005 sales of 2906 million and a segment loss of 173 million in fiscal 2005 we built the bob’s stores organization and we continued to refine the concept including repositioning the division’s promotional activity improving its inventory management fine tuning its product assortment and testing a smaller store size for fiscal 2006 we plan to open 5 bob’s stores and increase selling square footage by 15 

20 general corporate expense 

   general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments this item includes the costs of the corporate office including the compensation and benefits for senior corporate management payroll and operating costs of the nondivisional departments for accounting and budgeting internal audit treasury investor relations tax risk management legal human resources and systems and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff in addition general corporate expense includes the cost of benefits for existing retirees and nonoperating costs and other gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions general corporate expense is included in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 

  the increase in general corporate expense in fiscal 2005 over the prior year reflects the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses the majority of which relates to derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency exposures on intercompany activity in addition general corporate expense for fiscal 2005 reflects an increase in general corporate overhead incremental audit fees and costs related to the startup of our ecommerce businesses this increase was offset in part by a 63 million reduction in contributions to the tjx foundation in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

  the increase in general corporate expense from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of contributions to the tjx foundation of 98 million in fiscal 2004 in fiscal 2003 there were no contributions to the tjx foundation this increase in general corporate expense was partially offset by the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses and related hedging activity the majority of this item relates to derivative contracts that provide an economic hedge of foreign currency exposures on divisional inventory commitments and intercompany activity the changes in the fair value of the contracts are reflected currently in earnings in fiscal 2003 and for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 the realized gains or losses on these contracts were allocated to the appropriate division at the time the contracts were settled effective with the fourth quarter ended january 31 2004 we began including the unrealized values of these contracts within the individual segments 

liquidity and capital resources 

operating activities 

  net cash provided by operating activities was 10798 million in fiscal 2005 7705 million in fiscal 2004 and 9086 million in fiscal 2003 the cash generated from operating activities each of these fiscal years is largely due to strong operating earnings the difference in net cash provided from operating activities from year to year is largely driven by the change in inventory net of accounts payable from prior yearend levels in fiscal 2005 this change in net inventory position resulted in a use of cash of 853 million compared to 1918 million in fiscal 2004 and 401 million in fiscal 2003 average per store inventories including inventory on hand at our distribution centers at january 29 2005 increased only 1 compared to the prior year whereas inventories per store at january 31 2004 were up 11 compared to the prior year this change in net inventory position and the trend in inventory levels per store reflect our decision to raise the level of store inventories in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 levels and to maintain them at fiscal 2004 levels in fiscal 2005 effective with the third quarter ended october 30 2004 we began to accrue for inventory obligations at the time inventory is shipped rather than when received and accepted by tjx this accrual as of january 29 2005 increased both inventory and accounts payable by 237 million and thus had no impact on cash flow from operations 

  the cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2005 were also impacted by a larger increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities than in fiscal 2004 reflecting increased accruals at the end of fiscal 2005 for rent and landlord allowances property additions gift cards and payroll the cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2004 were impacted by a smaller increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities at the end of fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 reflecting reduced accruals for property additions and the payment of the california lawsuits in fiscal 2004 the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities also reflects cash expenditures of 71 million in fiscal 2005 372 million in fiscal 2004 and 322 million in fiscal 2003 charged against our discontinued operations reserve as discussed in more detail below 

21   operating cash flows in fiscal 2005 and to a greater extent in fiscal 2004 were favorably affected by deferred tax benefits related to payments against the discontinued operations reserve and increased accelerated depreciation on certain assets allowed for us income tax purposes cash flows from operating activities were reduced by contributions to our qualified pension fund of 250 million in fiscal 2005 175 million in fiscal 2004 and 580 million in fiscal 2003 all of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 were made on a voluntary basis 

  discontinued operations reserve we have a reserve for potential future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases of former tjx businesses that have been sold or spun off the reserve reflects tjx’s estimation of its cost for claims that have been or are likely to be made against tjx for liability as an original lessee or guarantor of the leases when the assignees of the leases filed for bankruptcy after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations 

  at january 29 2005 substantially all leases of discontinued operations that were rejected in the bankruptcies and for which the landlords asserted liability against tjx had been resolved it is possible that there will be future costs for leases from these discontinued operations that were not terminated or have not expired we do not expect to incur any material costs related to our discontinued operations in excess of our reserve the reserve balance amounted to 124 million as of january 29 2005 and 175 million as of january 31 2004 

  we may also be contingently liable on up to 20 leases of bj’s wholesale club another former tjx business for which bj’s wholesale club is primarily liable our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to tjx with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of bj’s wholesale club 

  offbalance sheet liabilities we have contingent obligations on leases for which we were a lessee or guarantor which were assigned to third parties without tjx being released by the landlords over many years we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties with the exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed above we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned leases and accordingly we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them 

  we also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate we estimate the undiscounted obligations not reflected in our reserves of leases of closed stores of continuing operations bj’s wholesale club leases discussed in note k to the consolidated financial statements and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations is approximately 120 million as of january 29 2005 we believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to tjx and to the extent they do will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors 

  we are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold specified environmental matters or certain income taxes these obligations are typically limited in time and amount there are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations 

investing activities 

  our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table below 

 22   we expect that capital expenditures will approximate 530 million for fiscal 2006 this includes 168 million for new stores 262 million for store renovations expansions and improvements and 100 million for our office and distribution centers our planned rate of growth in selling square footage per year is approximately 8 on a consolidated basis for the next several years our rate of store growth and the planned expansion and renovation of existing stores are the major factors in our increase in planned capital expenditures 

  investing activities for fiscal 2004 includes a net cash outflow of 571 million to acquire bob’s stores as discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements 

financing activities 

  cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 5876 million in fiscal 2005 5468 million in fiscal 2004 and 5091 million in fiscal 2003 the majority of this outflow relates to our share repurchase program 

  we spent 5946 million in fiscal 2005 5207 million in fiscal 2004 and 4817 million in fiscal 2003 under our stock repurchase programs we repurchased 251 million shares in fiscal 2005 268 million shares in fiscal 2004 and 259 million shares in fiscal 2003 all shares repurchased were retired with the exception of 75000 shares purchased in fiscal 2004 and 87638 shares purchased in fiscal 2003 which are held in treasury during may 2004 we completed a 1 billion stock repurchase program and announced our intention to repurchase an additional 1 billion of common stock since the inception of the new 1 billion stock repurchase program as of january 29 2005 we have repurchased 177 million shares at a total cost of 4066 million under this program all of these repurchased share numbers reflect the twoforone stock split distributed in may 2002 

  financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on longterm debt of 5 million in fiscal 2005 and 15 million in fiscal 2004 

  we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 18 per share in fiscal 2005 14 per share in fiscal 2004 and 12 per share in fiscal 2003 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 834 million in fiscal 2005 689 million in fiscal 2004 and 600 million in fiscal 2003 financing activities also include proceeds of 969 million in fiscal 2005 592 million in fiscal 2004 and 339 million in fiscal 2003 from the exercise of employee stock options these stock option exercises along with vesting of restricted stock awards also provided tax benefits of 209 million in fiscal 2005 136 million in fiscal 2004 and 118 million in fiscal 2003 these tax benefits are included in cash provided by operating activities 

  we traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of shortterm commercial paper during fiscal 2003 we entered into a 370 million fiveyear revolving credit facility and in fiscal 2005 we renewed our 364day revolving credit facility for 330 million effective march 17 2005 we extended the 364day agreement until july 15 2005 with substantially all of the terms and conditions of the original facility remaining unchanged we anticipate that during the year we will negotiate new agreements increasing the aggregate size of our revolving credit facilities and extending their maturity the credit facilities do not require any compensating balances however tjx must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios based on our current financial condition we believe that noncompliance with these covenants is remote the revolving credit facilities are used as backup to our commercial paper program as of january 29 2005 there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities the maximum amount of our us shortterm borrowings outstanding was 5 million during fiscal 2005 and 27 million during fiscal 2004 there were no shortterm borrowings during fiscal 2003 the weighted average interest rate on our us shortterm borrowings was 204 in fiscal 2005 and 109 in fiscal 2004 as of january 29 2005 we had credit lines totaling c20 million for our canadian subsidiary the maximum amount outstanding under our canadian credit line was c68 million during fiscal 2005 c56 million in fiscal 2004 and c192 million in fiscal 2003 the funding requirements of our canadian operations were largely provided by tjx 

  we believe that our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs see note c to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our longterm debt and available financing sources 

23   contractual obligations as of january 29 2005 we had payment obligations including current installments under longterm debt arrangements leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows in thousands 

   the above maturity table assumes that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal 2008 the note holders also have put options available to them in fiscal 2014 if none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted the notes will mature in fiscal 2022 

  the lease commitments in the above table are for minimum rent and do not include costs for insurance real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs that we are obligated to pay these costs were approximately onethird of the total minimum rent for the fiscal year ended january 29 2005 

  our purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for merchandise purchase orders for capital expenditures supplies and other operating needs commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services and commitments under a limited number of executive employment agreements we excluded longterm agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty 

  we also have longterm liabilities that do not have specified maturity dates included in other longterm liabilities is 1257 million for employee compensation and benefits most of which will come due beyond five years and 1153 million for accrued rent the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table 

critical accounting policies 

  tjx must evaluate and select applicable accounting policies we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to inventory valuation retirement obligations casualty insurance and accounting for taxes we believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained had alternative assumptions been selected would not be materially different from the results we have reported 

  inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory on a firstin firstout basis under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory this method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage a significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns under the retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed we believe the retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods in addition as a normal business practice we have a very specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing the need for management estimates inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but is based on a full physical inventory at fiscal year end thus the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results but is not a factor in full year results overall we believe that the retail method coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated lastly many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions which ultimately affect the value of the inventory our offprice businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors bob’s stores the valueoriented retailer we acquired in december 2003 does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain 

24 conditions are met these arrangements do have some impact on bob’s inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results 

  retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent in the aggregate obligations that will ultimately be settled far in the future and are therefore subject to estimates we are required to make assumptions regarding variables such as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the longterm rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period the discount rate which we determine annually based on market interest rates has dropped over the past several years and our actual returns on pension assets for the several years prior to fiscal 2004 were considerably less than our expected returns these two factors can have a considerable impact on the annual cost of retirement benefits and in recent years have had an unfavorable effect on the funded status of our qualified pension plan we have made contributions of 1005 million which exceeded the minimum required over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan 

  casualty insurance the nature of our casualty insurance program for certain fiscal periods primarily fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 carries a deductible that exposes tjx to losses for casualty claims in excess of our estimated annual cost of such losses the accrual for our estimated losses requires us with the aid of an actuarial service and based upon claims experience of tjx and other factors to make significant estimates and assumptions actual results could differ from these estimates a large portion of these losses are funded during the policy year offsetting our estimated loss accruals the company has a net accrual of 264 million for the unfunded portion of its casualty losses as of january 29 2005 

  accounting for taxes like many large corporations we are regularly under audit by the united states federal state local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions we accrue charges for possible exposures based on the annual evaluations of tax positions we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted the internal revenue service is currently examining the fiscal years ended january 2000 through january 2003 and we also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process 

recent accounting pronouncements 

  in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” sfas no 123r which requires that the cost of all employee stock options as well as other equitybased compensation arrangements be reflected in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date with limited exceptions that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period usually the vesting period this statement is effective for public entities as of the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june 15 2005 our third quarter of fiscal 2006 we disclose the pro forma impact of expensing stock options in accordance with sfas no 123 as originally issued in our notes to the consolidated financial statements and we are still assessing the impact that sfas no 123r will have on our financial statements 

  in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 “inventory costs” which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and wasted material spoilage by requiring these items to be recognized as currentperiod charges sfas no 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 with earlier application permitted we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements 

  in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets” an amendment of apb opinion no 29 this statement addresses the measurement of exchanges of nonmonetary assets it eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21b of apb 29 and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance this statement is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have any material impact on our financial statements 

25   on january 12 2004 the fasb released staff position no sfas 1061 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” which addresses the accounting and disclosure implications that are expected to arise as a result of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the “act” enacted on december 8 2003 we are in the process of determining if our plan is actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and our disclosed postretirement medical cost of 67 million for fiscal 2005 has not been reduced by any federal subsidy we do not expect that any subsidy for which we may qualify will be material 

market risk 

  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our canadian winners and homesense and european tk maxx operations as more fully described in notes a and d to the consolidated financial statements we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations intercompany transactions with these operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations with derivative financial instruments we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we do not enter into derivatives for speculative trading purposes 

  in addition the assets of our qualified pension plan a large portion of which is invested in equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market we allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 

  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our canadian winners and homesense and european tk maxx operations as more fully described in notes a and d to the consolidated financial statements we hedge a significant portion of our net investment in foreign operations intercompany transactions with these operations and certain merchandise purchase commitments incurred by these operations with derivative financial instruments we enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of january 29 2005 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  our cash equivalents and shortterm investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by the company we occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing however we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions 

  we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year as of january 29 2005 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

  b management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting 

  the management of tjx is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f promulgated under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended as a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

  because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of january 29 2005 based on the framework in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” based on that evaluation management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january 29 2005

 item 1 business tableend   we are the leading offprice retailer of apparel and home fashions in the united states and worldwide our seven offprice chains are synergistic in their philosophies and operating platforms we offer offprice family apparel and home fashions through our tj maxx marshalls and aj wright chains in the united states our winners chain in canada and our tk maxx chain in the united kingdom and ireland we offer exclusively offprice home fashions through our homegoods chain in the united states and our canadian homesense chain operated by winners the target customer for all of our offprice chains except aj wright is the middle to uppermiddle income shopper with the same profile as a department or specialty store customer aj wright targets a more moderate income customer we acquired bob’s stores in december 2003 a 31store valueoriented branded apparel retailer based in the northeast united states that offers casual family apparel bob’s stores’ target customer demographic includes a large percentage of male shoppers and spans the moderate to uppermiddle income bracket   our offprice mission is to deliver an exciting fresh and rapidly changing assortment of brandname merchandise at excellent values to our customers we define value as the combination of quality brand fashion and price with over 400 buyers worldwide and over 10000 vendors we believe we are well positioned to continue accomplishing this goal our key strengths include    as an offprice retailer we offer finequality name brand and designer family apparel and home fashions every day at substantial savings from comparable department and specialty store regular prices we can offer these everyday savings as a result of our opportunistic buying strategies disciplined inventory management including rapid inventory turns and low expense structure   in our offprice concepts we purchase much of our inventory opportunistically with only a small percentage specifically manufactured for us different from traditional retailers that order goods far in advance of the time they will appear on the selling floor tjx buyers are in the marketplace virtually every week by maintaining a liquid inventory position our buyers can buy close to need enabling them to buy into current market trends and take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace due to the unpredictable nature of consumer demand in the marketplace and the mismatch of supply and demand we are regularly able to buy the vast majority of our inventory directly from manufacturers with some merchandise coming from retailers and others virtually all of our buys are made at significant discounts from initial wholesale prices we generally purchase merchandise to sell in the current selling season as well as a limited quantity of packaway merchandise that we buy specifically to warehouse and sell in a future selling season we are willing to purchase less than a full assortment of styles and sizes we pay promptly and do not ask for typical retail concessions such as promotional and markdown allowances or delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries our financial strength strong reputation and ability to sell large quantities of merchandise through a geographically diverse network of stores gives us excellent access to leading branded merchandise our opportunistic buying permits us to consistently offer our customers a rapidly changing merchandise assortment at everyday prices which are below department and specialty store regular prices   we are extremely disciplined in our inventory management and we rapidly turn the inventory in our offprice chains we rely heavily on sophisticated internally developed inventory systems and controls that permit a virtually continuous flow of merchandise into our stores and an expansive distribution infrastructure that 1 supports our closetoneed buying by delivering goods to the selling floor quickly and efficiently for example highly automated storage and distribution systems track allocate and deliver an average of 12000 items per week to each tj maxx and marshalls store in addition specialized computer inventory planning purchasing and monitoring systems coupled with warehouse storage processing handling and shipping systems permit a continuous evaluation and rapid replenishment of store inventory pricing markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment requirements are determined centrally using satellitetransmitted information provided by pointofsale computer terminals and are designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner these inventory management and distribution systems allow us to achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of product and sell substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods 

  we operate with a low cost structure relative to many other retailers while we seek to provide a pleasant easy shopping environment with emphasis on customer convenience we do not spend large sums on store fixtures our selling floor space is flexible and largely free of permanent fixtures so we can easily expand and contract departments in response to customer demand and available merchandise also our large presence and expertise in the real estate market allows us to retain very favorable lease terms in our offprice concepts our advertising budget as a percentage of sales is low compared to traditional department and specialty stores with our advertising focused on awareness of shopping at our stores rather than promoting particular merchandise our high sales per square foot productivity and rapid inventory turnover also provide expense efficiencies   with all our offprice chains operating with the same offprice strategies and systems we are able to capitalize upon expertise and best practices throughout our divisions develop associates by transferring them from one chain to another and grow our various businesses efficiently and effectively   during the fiscal year ended january 31 2004 we derived 831 of our sales from the united states 297 from the northeast 152 from the midwest 245 from the south 08 from the central plains 129 from the west 81 from canada 75 from europe specifically in the united kingdom and ireland and 13 from puerto rico   unless otherwise indicated all store information is as of january 31 2004 all references to store square footage are to gross square feet fiscal 2003 means the fiscal year ended january 25 2003 fiscal 2004 means the fiscal year ended january 31 2004 and fiscal 2005 means the fiscal year ending january 29 2005 our business is subject to seasonal influences which causes us generally to realize higher levels of sales and income in the second half of the year this is common in the apparel retail business tj maxx and marshalls   tj maxx is the largest offprice retail chain in the united states with 745 stores in 47 states marshalls is the secondlargest offprice retailer in the united states with 659 stores in 42 states as well as 14 stores in puerto rico we maintain the separate identities of the tj maxx and marshalls stores through product assortment and merchandising marketing and store appearance this encourages our customers to shop at both chains   tj maxx and marshalls primarily target female customers who have families with middle to uppermiddle incomes and who generally fit the profile of a department or specialty store shopper these chains operate with a common buying and merchandising organization and have consolidated administrative functions including finance and human resources the combined organization known internally as the marmaxx group offers us increased leverage to purchase merchandise at favorable prices and allows us to operate with a lower cost structure these advantages are key to our ability to sell quality brand name merchandise at substantial discounts from department and specialty store regular prices   tj maxx and marshalls sell quality brand name merchandise at prices generally 2060 below department and specialty store regular prices both chains offer family apparel accessories giftware and home fashions tj maxx also offers women’s shoes and fine jewelry while marshalls also offers a fullline footwear department and a larger men’s department in fiscal 2004 tj maxx tested expanded jewelry and accessories 2 departments and marshalls experimented with an expanded footwear offering we believe these expanded offerings will further differentiate the shopping experience at tj maxx and marshalls giving our customers even more reasons to shop at both concepts our plan for fiscal 2005 calls for the addition of approximately 282 expanded jewelry and accessories departments at tj maxx and 67 expanded shoe departments at marshalls 

  in fiscal 2005 we plan to launch a tj maxx ecommerce website this website will offer a rapidly changing wide selection of quality brand name fashions priced below department and specialty store regular prices designed to create a shopping experience similar to shopping in our stores we see this website as a means to further service our existing customer base and attract new customers to both the website and to our stores   tj maxx and marshalls stores are generally located in suburban community shopping centers tj maxx stores average approximately 30000 square feet marshalls stores average approximately 31000 square feet we currently expect to add a net of 60 stores in fiscal 2005 ultimately we believe that tj maxx and marshalls together can operate approximately 1800 stores in the united states and puerto rico homegoods   homegoods is our offprice retail chain that focuses exclusively on the home fashions market homegoods offers a broad array of giftware accent furniture lamps rugs accessories and seasonal merchandise for the home in fiscal 2004 homegoods increased its lighting and accent furniture selections many of the homegoods stores are standalone stores however we also combine homegoods stores with a tj maxx or marshalls store in a superstore format that we call tj maxx ’n more or marshalls megastore we count the superstores as both a tj maxx or marshalls store and a homegoods store   homegoods like tj maxx also plans to launch an ecommerce website in fiscal 2005 with a similar offprice approach the homegoods website will offer home fashions in a wide array of rapidly changing assortments priced below department and specialty store regular prices we believe an ecommerce business is well suited for homegoods and will attract new customers to the website and to our stores   standalone homegoods stores average approximately 28000 square feet in superstores which average approximately 52000 square feet we dedicate an average of 21000 square feet to homegoods the 182 stores open at yearend include 106 standalone stores and 76 superstores in fiscal 2005 we anticipate adding a net of 40 homegoods stores including 22 superstores we believe that the us market could support approximately 500 freestanding homegoods stores and 150 superstores in the longterm winners and homesense   winners is the leading offprice retailer in canada offering offprice brand name women’s apparel and shoes lingerie accessories home fashions giftware fine jewelry menswear and children’s clothing in fiscal 2002 winners opened its first seven homesense stores in canada like our homegoods chain homesense offers a wide and rapidly changing assortment of offprice home fashions including giftware accent furniture lamps rugs accessories and seasonal merchandise for the home in fiscal 2004 winners also opened its first superstore which combines a winners store with a homesense store we count the superstores as both a winners store and a homesense store   we currently operate a total of 160 winners stores which average approximately 28000 square feet and 25 homesense stores which average approximately 24000 square feet we expect to add 8 winners stores and 15 homesense stores in fiscal 2005 including seven superstores ultimately we believe the canadian market can support approximately 200 winners stores and approximately 80 homesense stores 3 tk maxx   tk maxx is the only major offprice retailer in any european country tk maxx utilizes the same offprice strategies employed by tj maxx marshalls and winners and offers the same type of merchandise we currently operate 147 tk maxx stores in the united kingdom and ireland tk maxx stores average approximately 27000 square feet tk maxx has been successfully expanding its selling square footage with the addition of mezzanines in some of its stores this increases sales productivity with little additional rental costs tk maxx expects to continue to add mezzanines to its stores where possible tk maxx opened 23 stores in the united kingdom and one store in ireland in fiscal 2004 we currently expect to add a total of 25 stores in the united kingdom and ireland in fiscal 2005 we believe that the uk and ireland can support approximately 300 stores in the long term aj wright   aj wright a relatively young chain launched in fiscal 1999 brings our offprice concept to a different demographic customer the moderate income shopper aj wright stores offer brandname family apparel accessories footwear home fashions giftware and special marketdriven purchases aj wright has advanced its understanding of its target customers’ tastes and has transitioned to offering both “hot” fashion items as well as basic apparel assortments aj wright stores average approximately 26000 square feet we added a net of 24 aj wright stores in fiscal 2004 and operated 99 stores at fiscal year end we currently expect to open 32 aj wright stores in fiscal 2005 we believe this developing business offers us the longterm opportunity to open over 1000 aj wright stores throughout the united states bob’s stores   bob’s stores was acquired by tjx on december 24 2003 with large highvolume stores branded apparel selections a value orientation and a loyal customer base bob’s stores shares many characteristics with our offprice chains bob’s stores offers casual family apparel and footwear with emphasis on men’s clothing footwear workwear activewear and licensed team apparel bob’s stores customer demographics span the moderate to uppermiddle income bracket with a large percentage of male shoppers tjx purchased bob’s stores as a longterm growth vehicle and plans to grow bob’s stores slowly in the shortterm we currently operate 31 bob’s stores in the northeast united states and expect to open 2 additional bob’s stores in fiscal 2005 we see the potential over time of growing bob’s stores to a chain of 400 stores in the united states 4   we operated stores in the following locations as of january 31 2004     winners operated 160 stores in canada 21 in alberta 5 in manitoba 73 in ontario 26 in quebec 4 in nova scotia 6 in saskatchewan 19 in british columbia 3 in new brunswick 2 in

  tk maxx operated 143 stores in the united kingdom and 4 stores in the republic of ireland 5 employees   at january 31 2004 we had approximately 105000 employees many of whom work less than 40 hours per week in addition we hire temporary employees during the peak backtoschool and holiday seasons competition   the retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive our customers focus upon fashion quality price merchandise selection and freshness brand name recognition and to a lesser degree store location we compete with local regional and national department specialty and offprice stores we also compete to some degree with any retailer that sells apparel or home fashions in stores through catalogues or over the internet we purchase most of our inventory opportunistically and compete for that merchandise with other national and regional offprice apparel and outlet stores we also compete with other retailers for store locations credit   our stores operate primarily on a cashandcarry basis each chain accepts credit sales through programs offered by banks and others while we do not operate our own customer credit card program or maintain customer credit receivables a tjx visa card is offered through a major bank for our domestic offprice divisions the rewards program associated with this card is partially funded by tjx buying and distribution   we operate a centralized buying organization that services both the tj maxx and marshalls chains while each of our other chains has its own centralized buying organization all of our chains are

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   the following discussion contains forwardlooking information and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements due to various factors including those discussed in item 1 of this report under the section entitled “safe harbor statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995” results of operations 

 

   during the fiscal year ended january 31 2004 fiscal 2004 the company’s diluted earnings per share increased 19 to 128 which was in the upper end of our planned range our strong results helped us to achieve an aftertax return on average shareholders’ equity of 44 we achieved this performance despite below plan growth in both same store and total sales by growing our pretax profit margin the ratio of pretax income to sales the pretax profit margin increase was achieved primarily through improvement to our merchandise margins the result of effective inventory management and merchandising strategies pretax profit margin also benefited from disciplined expense management and was favorably impacted by the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 calendar we continued to grow our business opening 188 new stores net of closings and excluding the acquisition of bob’s stores increasing our store count 10 to 2031 bob’s stores a valueoriented chain of 31 stores located in the northeast united states was acquired in december 2003 as a platform for future growth strong cash flows from operations allowed us to fund our capital expenditure requirements and the bob’s stores acquisition while continuing our stock buyback program during fiscal 2004 we repurchased 27 million shares at a cost of 515 million which contributed to earnings per share growth our ability to continue to report annual earnings per share growth will be driven by revenue growth from our new store openings along with increases in same store sales maintaining steady profit margins and the benefit from our share repurchase program the execution of our buying strategies and disciplined inventory management leading to rapid inventory turns are key factors to our continued success   the following is a summary of the operating results of tjx at the consolidated level this discussion is followed by an overview of operating results by segment all references to earnings per share are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise indicated all earnings per share calculations and per share data have been adjusted to give effect for the twoforone stock split distributed on may 8 2002 

 

   net sales for tjx for our fiscal year ended january 31 2004 totaled 133 billion an 112 increase over sales of 120 billion for our fiscal year ended january 25 2003 fiscal 2003 the net sales for fiscal 2003 represented an 119 increase over sales of 107 billion for our fiscal year ended january 26 2002 fiscal 2002 our reporting period for fiscal 2004 included 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in both fiscal 2003 and 2002 the 53rd week in fiscal 2004 increased net sales by an estimated 15 over fiscal 2003   the 11 increase in net sales for fiscal 2004 includes approximately 8 from new stores 1 from same store sales growth with the balance primarily due to the 53rd week each of these factors includes the favorable effect of changes in the currency exchange rates of our winners and tk maxx operations same store sales in fiscal 2004 benefited approximately 1 12 percentage points from foreign currency exchange rates the 11 growth in net sales for the year was less than we had planned primarily due to lower than expected same store sales the increase in net sales of 12 in fiscal 2003 includes approximately 9 from new stores and 3 from same store sales growth foreign currency exchange rate changes also favorably impacted fiscal 2003 sales growth but to a much lesser extent than the impact in fiscal 2004   new stores are our major source of sales growth our consolidated store count excluding bob’s stores increased by 102 in fiscal 2004 and 107 in fiscal 2003 over the respective prior year period our selling square footage excluding bob’s stores increased by 96 in fiscal 2004 and by 101 in fiscal 2003 in each case over the prior year our acquisition of bob’s stores on december 24 2003 added 31 units as of the end of 13 fiscal 2004 net sales for bob’s stores are included in our results from the date of acquisition although the impact on sales growth was not significant 

  consolidated same store sales growth of 1 in fiscal 2004 including foreign currency benefit was less than planned largely due to the effect of unseasonable weather in the first half of the year the sales results for fiscal 2003 reflected strong demand for home fashions and were achieved despite a weak economy geopolitical concerns and a highly promotional retail environment same store sales growth in both years was favorably affected by our younger divisions as their share of consolidated results continues to increase   we expect to add 182 stores net of store closings in fiscal 2005 an 88 increase in our consolidated store base and we expect to increase our selling square footage base by 89 we have planned a 4 to 5 increase in same store sales and a 13 increase in total sales for fiscal 2005 we estimate that approximately 1 to 15 of this sales growth will come from favorable currency exchange rates we plan on adding or expanding certain departments in many of our stores to help drive our same store sales growth these initiatives are discussed in more detail below   we define same store sales to be sales of those stores that have been in operation for all or a portion of two consecutive fiscal years or in other words stores that are starting their third fiscal year of operation we classify a store as a new store until it meets the same store criteria we determine which stores are included in the same store sales calculation at the beginning of a fiscal year and the classification remains constant throughout that year unless a store is closed we calculate same store sales results by comparing the current and prior year weekly periods that are most closely aligned relocated stores and expanded stores are generally classified in the same way as the original store we believe that the impact of relocated or expanded stores on the same store percentage is immaterial consolidated and divisional same store sales are calculated in us dollars we also show divisional same store sales in local currency for our foreign divisions because this removes the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and we believe it is a more appropriate measure of their operating performance   the following table sets forth our consolidated operating results as a percentage of net sales  

 

   cost of sales including buying and occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales was 756 in fiscal 2004 758 in fiscal 2003 and 759 in fiscal 2002 this ratio in fiscal 2004 was better than our plan and reflects a significant improvement in merchandise margin primarily in the second half of fiscal 2004 the improved merchandise margin contributed to an approximate 6 reduction in our consolidated cost of sales ratio successful execution of our inventory and merchandising strategies and buying closer to need led to this improvement the improvement in this ratio in fiscal 2004 was partially offset by higher store occupancy costs as a percentage of sales due to lowerthanplanned same store sales growth and higher distribution costs as a result of opening our new tj maxx distribution facility in pittston pennsylvania store occupancy costs as a percentage of net sales increased by 3 for fiscal 2004 over last year and distribution costs as a percentage of net sales increased by 1 the cost of sales ratio was favorably impacted by the 53rd week in the fiscal 2004 reporting period as the sales volume from this extra week helped lever certain fixed costs the benefit from the 14 53rd week in fiscal 2004 which we estimate to be a 2 improvement in this ratio is reflected in the results discussed above 

  the improvement in the cost of sales ratio in fiscal 2003 is largely due to the improvement in merchandise margin at winners homegoods and tk maxx due to reduced markdowns resulting from improved inventory liquidity these improvements in fiscal 2003 offset an increase in this ratio of approximately 3 at marmaxx in fiscal 2003 marmaxx experienced higher distribution costs store occupancy costs and insurance and employee benefit costs as a percentage of net sales marmaxx was also impacted in fiscal 2003 by a lessthanplanned sales performance   we anticipate the cost of sales ratio in fiscal 2005 will be similar to fiscal 2004 

 

   selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 162 in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and 157 in fiscal 2002 overall selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were flat compared to fiscal 2003 and in line with our plan store payroll costs as a percentage of sales increased in fiscal 2004 as a result of the levering impact of lessthanplanned sales but this increase in the expense ratio was offset by the effect of higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to a 16 million litigation charge the litigation charge was for the estimated cost of settling claims related to four california lawsuits that alleged tjx had improperly classified store managers and assistant store managers as exempt from california overtime laws the lawsuits were settled and paid in fiscal 2004 for slightly less than 16 million selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2003 increased by approximately 3 due to increased costs for medical and retirement benefits and increases in store payroll attributable to lower employee turnover the charge for the california lawsuits in fiscal 2003 increased selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales by 1 we anticipate this expense ratio to increase in fiscal 2005 by 3 to 4 compared to fiscal 2004 this anticipated increase is largely due to the impact of the planned expansion of certain departments at many of our stores as well as increased costs for medical and retirement benefits 

 

   interest expense net of interest income was 273 million in fiscal 2004 254 million in fiscal 2003 and 256 million in fiscal 2002 interest income was 65 million in fiscal 2004 versus 105 million in fiscal 2003 and 150 million in fiscal 2002 the reduction in interest income in fiscal 2004 was due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates the reduction in interest income in fiscal 2003 was due to lower interest rates the decrease in gross interest expense in fiscal 2003 is due to the inclusion in fiscal 2002’s interest expense of amortization of debt expenses relating to the zero coupon convertible notes issued in february 2001 see note c to the consolidated financial statements we expect net interest expense to increase slightly in fiscal 2005 

 

   our effective annual income tax rate was 384 in fiscal 2004 383 in fiscal 2003 and 382 in fiscal 2002 the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2004 reflects increases in state income taxes compared to fiscal 2003 the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2003 includes the favorable effect of the tax benefit for payment of executive retirement benefits in exchange for the termination of splitdollar arrangements as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements this improvement in the effective tax rate was completely offset by the effect of increases in state income tax rates in fiscal 2003 the slight increase in the effective rate for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 is due to the impact of a onetime benefit in foreign taxes in fiscal 2002 based on our operating plans for fiscal 2005 and an anticipated increase in state income taxes we are planning a tax rate for fiscal 2005 of 386 

 

   income from continuing operations was 6584 million in fiscal 2004 5784 million in fiscal 2003 and 5404 million in fiscal 2002 income from continuing operations per share was 128 in fiscal 2004 versus 15 108 in fiscal 2003 and 97 in fiscal 2002 net income for fiscal 2002 includes an aftertax charge of 40 million or 07 per share due to discontinued operations for contingent lease obligations associated with house2home inc as described in note l to the consolidated financial statements net income after reflecting the above item was 6584 million or 128 per share in fiscal 2004 5784 million or 108 per share in fiscal 2003 and 5004 million or 90 per share in fiscal 2002 we estimate that the 53rd week in fiscal 2004 added 05 to our earnings per share and that favorable changes in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2004 added approximately 02 to our earnings per share the increase in earnings per share on a percentage basis in all periods increased more than the related earnings as a result of the impact of our share repurchase program we plan to continue our share repurchase program in fiscal 2005 with planned spending of 550 million 

 

   the following is a discussion of the operating results of our business segments we consider each of our operating divisions to be a segment we evaluate the performance of our segments based on “segment profit or loss” which we define as pretax income before general corporate expense goodwill amortization prior to fiscal 2003 and interest “segment profit or loss” as defined by tjx may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities in addition this measure of performance should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity more detailed information about our segments including a reconciliation of “segment profit or loss” to “income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes” can be found in note o to the consolidated financial statements marmaxx    marmaxx had a 1 same store sales decrease in fiscal 2004 which was below our plan and also below last year’s 2 increase despite a belowplan sales performance marmaxx segment profit margin was above plan as a result of sharp execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies and effective expense control with an expanded distribution capacity marmaxx was able to make closertoneed buys in fiscal 2004 leading to a strong markon and an improved merchandise margin especially in the second half of the year the marmaxx segment profit margin was also favorably impacted in fiscal 2004 by the 53rd week as the sales volume from this extra week helped lever certain fixed costs we estimate this impact to be 2 marmaxx segment profit improvement in fiscal 2004 also reflects the effect of higher costs in fiscal 2003 due to the 16 million litigation charge this charge also reduced segment profit margin by 2 in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 in fiscal 2003 marmaxx maintained a liquid inventory position throughout the year a key factor in this division’s maintaining its merchandise margin in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 the overall reduction in segment profit margin for fiscal 2003 reflected increases in insurance and employee benefits which accounted for a 3 drop in the segment profit margin lowerthanplanned sales and increased store payroll costs due in part to lower attrition also reduced the segment profit margin in fiscal 2003 new stores for marmaxx in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 performed above expectations   we added a net of 76 new stores in fiscal 2004 and increased total selling square footage by 6 we expect to open a net of 60 new stores in fiscal 2005 increasing the marmaxx store base by 4 we expect to increase our selling square footage by 5 16 winners and homesense    same store sales in local currency for winners and homesense increased by 4 in fiscal 2004 slightly less than planned on top of a 5 increase in the prior year new stores for winners and homesense performed above expectations in both fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 segment profit increased 25 in fiscal 2004 versus a 44 increase in fiscal 2003 and was slightly above our plan due to favorable changes in currency exchange rates we estimate that approximately twothirds of the increase in segment profit in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 was due to changes in currency exchange rates winners and homesense segment profit margin for fiscal 2004 was below plan and last year the reduction in segment profit margin as compared to fiscal 2003 reflects increased markdowns at winners and the increasing impact of homesense on their combined results homesense is at an earlier stage of development and operates with higher expense ratios than does winners in fiscal 2003 results were driven by a significant improvement in merchandise margin as a result of better inventory management as well as improved merchandise flow and mix throughout the year homesense net sales were 10 of this group’s total net sales in fiscal 2004 and 7 of total net sales in fiscal 2003   we added 14 winners stores and 10 homesense stores in fiscal 2004 and expanded selling square footage in canada by 14 in fiscal 2004 winners also opened its first superstore which combines a winners store with a homesense store we expect to open 8 winners and 15 homesense stores in fiscal 2005 including seven superstores increasing our total canadian store base by 12 and increasing selling square footage by 13 tk maxx    tk maxx operating in the united kingdom and ireland recorded sales and segment profit that exceeded plan same store sales increased 6 in local currency in fiscal 2004 on top of a 5 increase in the 17 prior year new stores for fiscal 2004 performed above our expectations segment profit increased 37 in fiscal 2004 and we estimate that approximately onequarter of the growth in segment profit during fiscal 2004 resulted from changes in currency exchange rates the strong segment performance in fiscal 2004 was driven by tk maxx’s strong execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies in fiscal 2003 segment profit increased 232 as we saw a significant increase in merchandise margin driven by improvements in inventory management the growth in segment profit for fiscal 2003 was also favorably impacted by changes in currency exchange rates which accounted for approximately 10 of the increase in segment profit 

  we added 24 new tk maxx stores in fiscal 2004 and increased selling square footage by 24 the actual store openings were six fewer than we originally planned but our increased use of mezzanine selling floors added selling square footage during fiscal 2004 and helped offset the fewer store openings with mezzanine space we increase our selling space with little additional rental costs thus increasing store productivity we plan to open an additional 25 tk maxx stores in fiscal 2005 and expand selling square footage by 26 homegoods    homegoods’ same store sales grew 1 in fiscal 2004 less than planned compared to a 6 increase in the prior year segment profit increased by 55 in fiscal 2004 to 498 million and was above our plan despite lessthanplanned sales performance the betterthanplan segment profit reflects homegoods’ continued solid execution of its merchandising and inventory strategies and a reduction in distribution and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales as the business grows new stores in both fiscal years performed above expectations in fiscal 2003 segment profit margins were up significantly as we saw improvements in merchandising inventory management store operations and distribution   we opened a net of 40 homegoods stores in fiscal 2004 a 28 increase and increased selling square footage by 25 in fiscal 2005 we plan on adding a net of 40 new homegoods stores and increasing selling square footage by 20 aj wright    aj wright sales were up 52 in fiscal 2004 to 4216 million due to an 8 increase in same store sales and 24 new stores in fiscal 2004 although same store sales were slightly below our plan total net sales were above plan reflecting the strong performance of new stores aj wright achieved a segment profit of 17 million in fiscal 2004 which was well ahead of plan and up significantly compared to a segment loss of 126 million in fiscal 2003 the improvement in aj wright’s segment profit is primarily the impact of 18 improved merchandising and strong inventory management leading to improved merchandise margins segment profit for fiscal 2004 also includes a 17 million gain in connection with an agreement to vacate a store property in fiscal 2003 aj wright’s segment loss was impacted in part by the unseasonably warm weather in the third quarter in areas of the country where aj wright has a large concentration of stores aj wright’s aggressive storeopening program for fiscal 2003 also placed strains on this young division and resulted in some execution issues which negatively impacted the bottom line in fiscal 2003 

  we added 24 new aj wright stores in fiscal 2004 increasing selling square footage by 31 in fiscal 2005 we plan to add 32 new stores and increase selling square footage by 31 bob’s stores   on december 24 2003 we completed the acquisition of bob’s stores a valueoriented casual family apparel retailer operating 31 stores the results of bob’s stores are included in our consolidated results from the date of acquisition during fiscal 2004 bob’s stores contributed 241 million to net sales and generated a segment loss of 5 million we currently operate 31 bob’s stores and expect to open 2 additional stores in fiscal 2005 we plan to evaluate and further develop this concept before initiating significant expansion plans we do not anticipate bob’s stores having a significant impact on tjx’s earnings over the next several years general corporate expense    general corporate expense for segment reporting purposes are those costs not specifically related to the operations of our business segments this item includes the costs of the corporate office including the compensation and benefits for senior corporate management payroll and operating costs of the nondivisional departments for accounting and budgeting internal audit treasury investor relations tax risk management legal human resources and systems and the occupancy and office maintenance costs associated with the corporate staff in addition general corporate expense includes the benefit costs of existing retirees and nonoperating costs and unusual gains and losses not attributable to individual divisions general corporate expense is included in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income   the increase in general corporate expense from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 is primarily the result of contributions to the tjx foundation of 98 million in fiscal 2004 in fiscal 2003 there were no contributions to the tjx foundation this increase in general corporate expense was partially offset by the change in net foreign exchange gains and losses and related hedging activity fiscal 2004 includes approximately 1 million in income due to net foreign exchange gains and losses as compared to approximately 5 million in net charges in fiscal 2003 the majority of this item relates to derivative contracts that provide an economic hedge of foreign currency exposures on divisional inventory commitments and intercompany activity we have not elected hedge accounting for these contracts thus the changes in the fair value of the contracts are reflected currently in earnings as of the end of fiscal 2004 the unrealized fair value of derivative contracts outstanding has been allocated to the related segments   the increase in general corporate expense from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2003 reflects increased costs for retirement and medical benefits of approximately 3 million as well as a pretax charge of approximately 2 million in connection with the transaction terminating splitdollar life insurance policies for two senior executives as described in note i to the consolidated financial statements this pretax charge was offset by tax benefits of 38 million in the income tax provision fiscal 2003 also includes approximately 5 million in net charges due to foreign exchange gains and losses and related hedging activity as compared to a net gain of less than 1 million in fiscal 2002 19 liquidity and capital resources 

 

   net cash provided by operating activities was 7705 million in fiscal 2004 9086 million in fiscal 2003 and 9124 million in fiscal 2002 the cash generated from operating activities each fiscal period is largely due to strong operating earnings the decline in net cash provided from operations in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 is primarily a result of an increase in our inventory net of related increase in accounts payable at the end of fiscal 2004 compared to the end of fiscal 2003 inventories per store at january 31 2004 were up 11 compared to the prior year and inventories per store at january 25 2003 were down 3 compared to the prior year excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates inventories per store at january 31 2004 increased 9 over the prior year this increase in inventory was attributable in part to our plan to raise the level of store inventories over fiscal 2003 levels the timing of inventory receipts in part due to the 53rd week also contributed to the higher inventory levels at january 31 2004 the cash flows from operating activities for fiscal 2004 were also impacted by a lower increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 the lower increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities reflects reduced accruals for property additions at the end of fiscal 2004 and the payment of the california lawsuits in fiscal 2004 the significant cash generated from operating activities in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 is largely due to strong operating earnings along with our liquid inventory position and our buying closer to need cash flows for fiscal 2003 also reflect the favorable impact of an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities the increase in accrued expenses for fiscal 2003 reflects the reserve for the settlement of the california lawsuits and higher accruals for property additions payroll and benefits merchandise credits and occupancy costs   operating cash flows for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 were favorably impacted by additional deferred tax benefits related to payments against the discontinued operations reserve and due to increased accelerated depreciation on certain assets allowed for us income tax purposes the cash flows from operating activities have been reduced by contributions to our qualified pension fund of 175 million in fiscal 2004 580 million in fiscal 2003 and 468 million in fiscal 2002 all of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 and 260 million of the contributions to the pension fund in fiscal 2002 were made on a voluntary basis cash flows from operating activities were also reduced by 372 million in fiscal 2004 322 million in fiscal 2003 and 41 million in fiscal 2002 for cash expenditures charged against the discontinued operations reserve as discussed in more detail below   discontinued operations reserve we have a reserve for potential future obligations of discontinued operations that relates primarily to real estate leases of the former house2home and zayre stores for which tjx is an original lessee or guarantor these discontinued operations are being liquidated in bankruptcy by third parties the reserve activity in prior years also reflects leases of hit or miss another discontinued operation that liquidated in the bankruptcy of a third party the reserve was established at various times subsequent to tjx’s disposition of these businesses when the companies then owning them suffered significant financial distress   when discontinued operations were sold to third parties tjx generally remained secondarily liable with respect to lease obligations if the purchaser fails to perform unless there are circumstances that terminate or reduce tjx’s potential liability the reserve reflects tjx’s estimation of its cost for claims that have been or are likely to be made against tjx based on potential secondary liability after mitigation of the number and cost of lease obligations mitigating factors include assignments to third parties lease terminations expirations subleases buyouts modifications and other actions legal defenses and use by tjx for its store opening program   at january 31 2004 substantially all of the house2home zayre stores and hit or miss leases that were rejected in the bankruptcy and for which the landlords asserted liability against tjx had been resolved as a result of negotiated buyouts assignments to third parties leasing for tjx’s own use or for sublease and lease expirations it is possible that there will be future costs for leases from these discontinued operations that were not terminated or expired but tjx does not expect any such costs to be material 20   the balance in the reserve and the activity for the last three fiscal years is presented below the addition to the reserve in fiscal 2002 relates to house2home the charges against the reserve during fiscal 2004 relate primarily to house2home and zayre stores lease obligations during fiscal 2003 the charges relate primarily to house2home lease obligations and during fiscal 2002 the charges relate primarily to former zayre stores and hit or miss locations    we do not expect to incur any material costs related to our discontinued operations in excess of our reserve in addition we expect to receive a creditor recovery in the house2home bankruptcy although the amount has not yet been determined   we may also be contingently liable on up to 20 leases of bj’s wholesale club for which bj’s wholesale club is primarily liable our reserve for discontinued operations does not reflect these leases because we believe that the likelihood of any future liability to tjx with respect to these leases is remote due to the current financial condition of bj’s wholesale club   offbalance sheet liabilities we have contingent obligations on any property we have leased or guaranteed and assigned to third parties without being released by the landlords over many years we have assigned numerous leases that we originally leased or guaranteed to a significant number of third parties with the exception of leases of our discontinued operations discussed in note l to the consolidated financial statements we have rarely had a claim with respect to assigned or guaranteed leases and accordingly we do not expect that such leases will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows we do not generally have sufficient information about these leases to estimate our potential contingent obligations under them   we also have contingent obligations in connection with some assigned or sublet properties that we are able to estimate we estimate the undiscounted obligations not reflected in our reserves of leases of closed stores of continuing operations discussed in note k to the consolidated financial statements bj’s wholesale club leases discussed in note l to the consolidated financial statements and properties of our discontinued operations that we have sublet if the subtenants did not fulfill their obligations is approximately 140 million as of january 31 2004 we believe that most or all of these contingent obligations will not revert to tjx and to the extent they do will be resolved for substantially less due to mitigating factors   we are a party to various agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to breach of warranty or losses related to such matters as title to assets sold specified environmental matters or certain income taxes these obligations are typically limited in time and amount there are no amounts reflected in our balance sheets with respect to these contingent obligations 21 

 

   our cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last two years as set forth in the table below    capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 were less than planned primarily due to lowerthanplanned spending on office facilities and information systems we expect that capital expenditures will approximate 500 million for fiscal 2005 this includes 188 million for new stores 221 million for store renovations and improvements and 91 million for our office and distribution centers our planned rate of new store growth per year is in the 8 to 9 range on a consolidated basis for the next several years our rate of store growth and the planned expansion and renovation of existing stores are the major factors in our increase in planned capital expenditures   investing activities for fiscal 2004 include a net cash outflow of 571 million to acquire bob’s stores as discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements investing activities for fiscal 2002 include 55 million of cash outlays due to advances we made under a construction loan agreement in connection with the expansion of our leased home office facility we received repayments under this loan agreement of 606000 in fiscal 2004 564000 in fiscal 2003 and 125000 in fiscal 2002  

 

   cash flows from financing activities resulted in net cash outflows of 5468 million in fiscal 2004 5091 million in fiscal 2003 and 997 million in fiscal 2002 the majority of this activity relates to our share repurchase program and our longterm borrowings   we spent 5207 million in fiscal 2004 4817 million in fiscal 2003 and 4242 million in fiscal 2002 under our stock repurchase programs we repurchased 268 million shares in fiscal 2004 259 million shares in fiscal 2003 and 263 million shares in fiscal 2002 all shares repurchased are retired with the exception of 75000 shares purchased in fiscal 2004 and 87638 shares purchased in fiscal 2003 all of which are held in treasury during july 2002 we completed a 1 billion stock repurchase program and announced our intention to repurchase an additional 1 billion of common stock over several years since the inception of the new 1 billion stock repurchase program as of january 31 2004 we have repurchased 430 million shares at a total cost of 8186 million all of these repurchased share numbers reflect the twoforone stock split distributed in may 2002   on february 13 2001 we issued 5175 million zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due in february 2021 and raised gross proceeds of 3476 million the issue price of the notes represented a yield to maturity of 2 per year the notes are convertible into 169 million shares of common stock of tjx if the sale price of our common stock reaches specified thresholds if the credit rating of the notes is below investment grade if the notes are called for redemption or if certain specified corporate transactions occur none of these conditions existed as of january 31 2004 january 25 2003 or january 26 2002 and thus the shares are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculations the holders of the notes have the right to require us to purchase the notes in february 2007 and february 2013 we may pay the purchase price in cash our stock or a combination of the two if the holders exercise this option we expect to fund the payment with cash financing from our shortterm credit facility new longterm borrowings or a combination thereof at the earlier put date of february 13 2002 no holders exercised the purchase option and more recently on february 13 2004 only 3000 in face value of bonds was put to tjx which were settled in cash we used the proceeds for our accelerated store rollout program investment in our distribution center network general 22 corporate purposes and our common stock repurchase program financing activities also included scheduled principal payments on longterm debt of 15 million in fiscal 2004 and 73000 in fiscal 2002 

  we declared quarterly dividends on our common stock which totaled 14 per share in fiscal 2004 12 per share in fiscal 2003 and 09 per share in fiscal 2002 cash payments for dividends on our common stock totaled 689 million in fiscal 2004 600 million in fiscal 2003 and 483 million in fiscal 2002 financing activities also include proceeds of 592 million in fiscal 2004 339 million in fiscal 2003 and 652 million in fiscal 2002 from the exercise of employee stock options these stock option exercises also provided tax benefits of 136 million in fiscal 2004 118 million in fiscal 2003 and 306 million in fiscal 2002 these benefits are included in cash provided by operating activities   we traditionally have funded our seasonal merchandise requirements through cash generated from operations shortterm bank borrowings and the issuance of shortterm commercial paper during fiscal 2003 we entered into a 370 million fiveyear revolving credit facility and in fiscal 2004 we renewed our 364day revolving credit facility for 330 million effective march 19 2004 the 364day agreement was renewed with substantially all of the terms and conditions of the original facility remaining unchanged the credit facilities do not require any compensating balances however tjx must maintain certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios based on our current financial condition we believe that the possibility of noncompliance with these covenants is remote the revolving credit facilities are used as backup to our commercial paper program as of january 31 2004 there were no outstanding amounts under our credit facilities the maximum amount of our us shortterm borrowings outstanding was 27 million during fiscal 2004 and 39 million during fiscal 2002 there were no shortterm borrowings during fiscal 2003 the weighted average interest rate on our us shortterm borrowings was 109 in fiscal 2004 and 532 in fiscal 2002 as of january 31 2004 we had credit lines totaling c20 million for our canadian subsidiary the maximum amount outstanding under our canadian credit line was c56 million in fiscal 2004 c192 million in fiscal 2003 and c226 million in fiscal 2002 the funding requirements of our canadian operations were largely provided by tjx   we believe that our current credit facilities are more than adequate to meet our operating needs see notes c and g to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our longterm debt capital stock transactions and available financing sources 

 

   as of january 31 2004 we have payments due including current installments under longterm debt arrangements leases for property and equipment and purchase obligations that will require cash outflows as follows in thousands    the above maturity table assumes that all holders of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes exercise their put options in fiscal 2008 the note holders also have put options available to them in fiscal 2014 if none of the put options are exercised and the notes are not redeemed or converted the notes will mature in fiscal 2022 23   our purchase obligations consist of purchase orders for merchandise purchase orders for capital expenditures supplies and other operating needs commitments under contracts for maintenance needs and other services and commitments under a limited number of executive employment agreements we excluded long term agreements for services and operating needs that can be cancelled without penalty   we also have longterm liabilities that do not have specified maturity dates included in longterm liabilities is 106 million for employee compensation and benefits most of which will come due beyond five years and 78 million for our rental stepup accrual the cash flow requirements of which are included in the lease commitments in the above table our longterm liabilities also include our discontinued operations reserve of 175 million we expect a large portion of this reserve will be paid in the next five years as settlements are reached while a smaller portion will extend beyond five years for those reserve obligations tied to the remaining lease term critical accounting policies   we have the obligation to evaluate and select applicable accounting policies for tjx we consider our most critical accounting policies involving management estimates and judgments to be those relating to inventory valuation retirement obligations accounting for taxes and reserves for discontinued operations we believe that we have selected the most appropriate assumptions in each of the following areas and that the results we would have obtained had alternative assumptions been selected would not be materially different from the results we have reported   inventory valuation we use the retail method for valuing inventory on a firstin firstout basis under the retail method the cost value of inventory and gross margins are determined by calculating a costtoretail ratio and applying it to the retail value of inventory this method is widely used in the retail industry and involves management estimates with regard to such things as markdowns and inventory shrinkage a significant factor involves the recording and timing of permanent markdowns under the firstin firstout retail method permanent markdowns are reflected in the inventory valuation when the price of an item is changed we believe the firstin firstout retail method results in a more conservative inventory valuation than other accounting methods in addition as a normal business practice we have a very specific policy as to when markdowns are to be taken greatly reducing the need for management estimates inventory shortage involves estimating a shrinkage rate for interim periods but is based on a full physical inventory at fiscal year end thus the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results but is not a factor in full year results overall we believe that the retail method coupled with our disciplined permanent markdown policy and a full physical inventory taken at each fiscal year end results in an inventory valuation that is fairly stated lastly many retailers have arrangements with vendors that provide for rebates and allowances under certain conditions which ultimately affect the value of the inventory our offprice businesses have historically not entered into such arrangements with our vendors bob’s stores the valueoriented retailer we acquired in december 2003 does have vendor relationships that provide for recovery of advertising dollars if certain conditions are met these arrangements will likely have some impact on bob’s stores’ inventory valuation but such amounts are immaterial to our consolidated results for fiscal 2004 over time we have found that actual results involving inventory valuation issues have not varied significantly from our estimates   retirement obligations retirement costs are accrued over the service life of an employee and represent an obligation that will ultimately be settled far in the future and is therefore subject to estimates we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the discount rate for valuing pension obligations and the longterm rate of return assumed to be earned on pension assets both of which impact the net periodic pension cost for the period the discount rate which we determine annually based on market interest rates has dropped over the past several years and our actual returns on pension assets for the several years prior to fiscal 2004 have been considerably less than our expected returns these two situations have resulted in a considerable increase in the annual cost of retirement benefits and have had an unfavorable effect on the funded status of our qualified pension plan we have made contributions of 1223 million which exceeded the minimum required over the last three years to largely restore the funded status of our plan in addition 24 during fiscal 2003 we reduced the assumption for the longterm rate of return on pension plan assets to 8 from 9 which increased net pension expense for fiscal 2003 by approximately 2 million 

  accounting for taxes we are continuously under audit by the united states federal state local or foreign tax authorities in the areas of income taxes and the remittance of sales and use taxes in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions we accrue charges for possible exposures based on the annual evaluations of tax positions we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted the internal revenue service is currently examining the fiscal years ended january 2000 through january 2003 and we also have various state and foreign tax examinations in process   reserves for discontinued operations as discussed in note l to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in the management’s discussion and analysis we have reserves established for leases relating to operations discontinued by tjx where tjx was the original lessee or a guarantor and which have been assigned to third parties these are longterm obligations and the estimated cost to us involves numerous estimates and assumptions as to whether we remain obligated with respect to a particular lease how a particular obligation may ultimately be settled and what mitigating factors including indemnification may exist we develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating various probable outcomes and the circumstances surrounding each situation and location actual results may differ from these estimates but we believe that our current reserve is a reasonable estimate of the most likely outcome and that the reserve is adequate to cover the ultimate cost we will incur recent accounting pronouncements   in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” interpretation no 46 in december 2003 the fasb issued a revision to interpretation no 46 to make certain technical corrections and address certain implementation issues that had arisen interpretation no 46 as revised provides a new framework for identifying variable interest entities vie’sand determining when a company should include the assets liabilities noncontrolling interests and results of activities of a vie in its consolidated financial statements interpretation no 46 was effective immediately for vie’s created after january 31 2003 we adopted the provisions of interpretation no 46 as revised as of january 31 2004 the adoption of this interpretation had no impact on our overall financial position and results of operations   in april 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 149 “amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities” this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under statement no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” the provisions of this statement are effective for all derivatives and hedging activity entered into after june 30 2003 the adoption of this statement had no impact on our overall financial position and results of operations   in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity the provisions of this statement are effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 the adoption of this statement had no impact on our overall financial position and results of operations   in december 2003 the fasb issued a revised sfas no 132 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” the revised statement requires some additional annual disclosures and makes certain disclosures required for interim reporting the additional disclosures required annually are included in note i to the consolidated financial statements some of the disclosure requirements of the revised sfas no 132 related to foreign plans interim periods and certain other matters are not effective until fiscal 2005 25   on january 12 2004 the fasb released staff position no sfas 1061 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” which addresses the accounting and disclosure implications that are expected to arise as a result of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 enacted on december 8 2003 specific guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending and we will assess the impact of such guidance when it is issued market risk   we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our canadian winners and homesense and european tk maxx operations as more fully described in notes a and d to the consolidated financial statements we hedge a significant portion of our net investment intercompany transactions and certain merchandise purchase commitments in these operations with derivative financial instruments we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures the contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we do not enter into derivatives for speculative trading purposes   in addition the assets of our qualified pension plan a large portion of which is invested in equity securities are subject to the risks and uncertainties of the public stock market we allocate the pension assets in a manner that attempts to minimize and control our exposure to these market uncertainties 26

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk tableend   we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on our investment in our canadian winners and homesense and european tk maxx operations as more fully described in note d to the consolidated financial statements on page f16 we hedge a significant portion of our net investment and certain merchandise commitments in these operations with derivative financial instruments we enter into derivative contracts only when there is an underlying economic exposure we utilize currency forward and swap contracts designed to offset the gains or losses in the underlying exposures most of which are recorded directly in shareholders’ equity the contracts are executed with banks we believe are creditworthy and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above as of january 31 2004 the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows   our cash equivalents and shortterm investments and certain lines of credit bear variable interest rates changes in interest rates affect interest earned and paid by the company we occasionally enter into financial instruments to manage our cost of borrowing however we believe that the use of primarily fixed rate debt minimizes our exposure to market conditions   we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in interest rates applied to the maximum variable rate debt outstanding during the previous year as of january 31 2004 the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows

offer offprice family apparel and home fashions through our tj maxx marshalls and aj wright chains in the united states our winners chain in canada and our tk maxx chain in the united kingdom and ireland we also operate homegoods in the united states a chain that focuses exclusively on offprice home fashions and we launched a canadian home fashions chain called homesense in fiscal 2002 the target customer for all of our chains except aj wright is the middle to uppermiddle income shopper with the same profile as a department or specialty store customer aj wright targets a more moderate income customer our mission is to deliver an exciting fresh and rapidly changing assortment of brandname merchandise at excellent values to our customers we define value as the combination of quality fashion and price with approximately 300 buyers worldwide and about 9000 vendors we believe we are well positioned to continue accomplishing this goal our key strengths include  as an offprice retailer we offer finequality name brand and designer family apparel and home fashions every day at substantial savings from comparable department and specialty store regular prices we can offer these every day savings as a result of our opportunistic buying strategies rapid inventory turns and low expense structure we purchase much of our inventory opportunistically different from traditional retailers which order goods far in advance of the time they will appear on the selling floor tjx buyers are in the marketplace virtually every week by maintaining a liquid inventory position our buyers can buy close to need enabling them to buy into current market trends and take advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace as a result we can offer our customers rapidly changing inventory at everyday prices substantially lower than regular department and specialty store prices due to the unpredictable nature of consumer demand in the marketplace we are regularly able to buy the vast portion of our inventory directly from manufacturers with some merchandise coming from retailers and others virtually all of our buys are made at significant discounts from initial wholesale prices tjx sources its merchandise from approximately 9000 vendors we generally purchase merchandise to sell in the current selling season as well as a limited quantity of packaway merchandise that we buy specifically to store and sell in a future selling season we are willing to purchase less than a full assortment of styles and sizes we pay promptly and do not ask for typical retail concessions such as promotional and markdown allowances or return privileges or delivery concessions such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries our financial strength strong reputation and ability to sell large quantities of merchandise through a geographically diverse network of stores gives us excellent access to leading branded merchandise we rely heavily on sophisticated internally developed inventory controls that permit a virtually continuous flow of merchandise into our stores for example highly automated storage and distribution systems track allocate and deliver an average of 12000 items per week to each 2 tj maxx and marshalls store in addition specialized computer inventory planning purchasing and monitoring systems coupled with warehouse storage processing handling and shipping systems permit a continuous evaluation and rapid replenishment of store inventory pricing markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment requirements are determined centrally using satellitetransmitted information provided by pointofsale computer terminals this process allows us to achieve rapid instore inventory turnover on a vast array of product and sell substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods we operate with a low cost structure relative to many other retailers while we seek to provide a pleasant easy shopping environment with emphasis on customer convenience we do not spend large sums on store fixtures similarly our advertising budget as a percent of sales is low with our advertising focused on awareness of shopping at our stores rather than promoting particular merchandise our high sales per square foot productivity and rapid inventory turnover also provides expense efficiencies because all of our chains operate with the same offprice strategies and systems we are able to capitalize upon expertise and best practices in all our chains develop associates by transferring them from one chain to another and grow our various businesses efficiently and effectively during the fiscal year ended january 25 2003 we derived 874 of our sales from the united states 308 from the northeast 160 from the midwest 267 from the south 09
