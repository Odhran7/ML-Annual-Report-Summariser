research driven approach to investments – the company believes that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio growth begin with extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge the company continually assesses markets where the company operates as well as markets where the company considers future investment opportunities by evaluating markets and focusing on the following strategic criteria 

• major metropolitan areas that have regional population in excess of one million 

• constraints on new supply driven by i low availability of developable land sites where competing housing could be economically built ii political growth barriers such as protected land urban growth boundaries and potential lengthy and expensive development permit processes and iii natural limitations to development such as mountains or waterways 

• rental demand enhanced by affordability of rents relative to costs of forsale housing and 

• housing demand based on job growth proximity to jobs high median incomes and the quality of life including related commuting factors 

recognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical the company regularly evaluates the results of its regional economic and local market research and adjusts the geographic focus of its portfolio accordingly the company seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to decrease allocations in markets projected to have declining economic conditions likewise the company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields

• adverse economic regulatory or market conditions due to the covid19 pandemic leading to 1 a temporary or permanent move by tenants andor prospective tenants from locations in which our communities are located 2 increased costs or government limitations on revenue andor 3 delinquency due to various eviction moratoria 

• inflationary environments in which the costs to operate and maintain communities increase at a rate greater than our ability to increase rents or deflationary environments where we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under our shortterm leases and 

• the appeal and desirability of our communities to tenants including without limitation the size and amenity offerings of our apartment homes the safety and convenience of their locations our technology offerings and our ability to identify and cost effectively implement new relevant technologies 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents and the company may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire if the company is unable to promptly renew the in place shortterm leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then the company’s results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected with these shortterm leases our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

national and regional economic environments can negatively impact the company’s liquidity and operating results the company’s forecast for the national economy assumes growth of the gdp of the national economy and the economies of the west coast states in the event of a recession or other negative economic effects the company could incur reductions in rental and occupancy rates property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising and turnover expenses any such recession or similar event may affect consumer confidence and spending and negatively impact the volume and pricing of real estate transactions which could negatively affect the company’s liquidity and its ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes to the economy furthermore if residents do not experience increases in their income they may be unable or unwilling to pay rent increases and delinquencies in rent payments and rent defaults may increase

rent control or rent stabilization laws and new such laws that may be implemented and other regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to increase rents and pass through new or increased operating costs to our tenants these initiatives and any other future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing as well as any lawsuits against the company arising from such rent control or other laws may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs such laws and regulations limit our ability to charge market rents increase rents evict tenants or recover increases in our operating expenses and could reduce the value of our communities or make it more difficult for us to dispose of properties in certain circumstances expenses associated with our investment in these communities such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from the community furthermore such regulations may negatively impact our ability to attract higherpaying tenants to such communities 

the covid19 pandemic or the future outbreak of other highly contagious diseases could materially affect our business financial condition and results of operations uncertainty still surrounds covid19 and the potential shortterm and longterm effects including but not limited to shifts in consumer housing demand based on geography affordability housing type and unit type mainly resulting from the paradigm shift of work culture as well as economic uncertainty volatility and increased regulation as a result our ability to make distributions to essex’s stockholders and the operating partnership’s unitholders may be compromised and we could experience volatility with respect to the market value of our properties and common stock and operating partnership units in some cases we are subject to eviction moratoria or may be legally required to or otherwise agree to restructure tenants’ rent obligations and may not be able to do so on terms as favorable to us as those currently in place furthermore various city county and state laws restricting rent increases in times of emergency have come into effect in connection with the covid19 pandemic and numerous state local federal and industryinitiated efforts have and may continue to affect our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent including among others limitations or prohibitions on evicting tenants unwilling or unable to pay rent and prohibitions on the ability to collect unpaid rent during certain timeframes in the event of tenant nonpayment default or bankruptcy we may incur costs in protecting our investment and releasing our property and have limited ability to renew existing leases or sign new leases at projected rents 

our properties may also incur significant costs or losses related to legislative mandates which may result in a negative impact on our occupancy levels for example many companies initially required and now are continuing to allow or require employees to “work from home” for an extended period of time causing some tenants to move away from the urban centers temporarily or permanently some businesses many have permanently closed due to deteriorating economic conditions which has contributed to the temporary or possibly permanent deterioration of neighborhoods in and around some of our urban communities which may be further worsened by increases in homelessness and crime there may also be an increased risk of material litigation due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic including litigation brought by our residents or employees 

market fluctuations as a result of the covid19 pandemic may affect our ability to obtain necessary funds for our operations acquisitions or refinancings in addition macroeconomic factors have caused some worker shortages and construction delays which could increase costs and lower profitability market fluctuations and construction delays experienced by the company’s thirdparty mezzanine loan borrowers and preferred equity investment sponsors may also negatively impact their ability to repay the company further while the company carries general liability pollution and property insurance along with other insurance policies that may provide some coverage for any losses or costs incurred in connection with the covid19 pandemic given the novelty of the issue and the scale of losses incurred throughout the world there is no guarantee that we will be able to recover all or any portion of our losses and costs under these policies we may be additionally impacted by changes in legislation relating to insurance coverages with respect to the pandemic including but not limited to workers’ compensation the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or any other related matters could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

acquisitions of communities involve various risks and uncertainties and may fail to meet expectations the company intends to continue to acquire apartment communities however there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet the company’s expectations the company’s estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow the company to market an acquired apartment community as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate in addition following an acquisition the value and operational performance of an apartment community may be diminished if obsolescence or neighborhood changes occur before we are able to redevelop or sell the community also in connection with such acquisitions we may assume unknown or contingent liabilities which could ultimately lead to material costs for us that we did not expect to incur and for which the company may have no recourse or only limited recourse against the sellers due to limited and no indemnification requirements for a breach of representations and warranties in addition the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with apartment communities may exceed our expectations and we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the company expects to finance future acquisitions under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships 

table of contents 

or joint ventures or additional equity by the company the use of equity financing for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the company’s existing stockholders if the company finances new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless the company obtains substitute financing the company may not be able to undertake additional borrowing for further acquisitions or developments or such borrowing may be not available on advantageous terms 

development and redevelopment activities may be delayed not completed andor not achieve expected results the company pursues development and redevelopment projects the company defines development projects as new communities that are being constructed or are newly constructed and are in a phase of leaseup and have not yet reached stabilized operations and redevelopment projects as existing properties owned or recently acquired that have been targeted for additional investment by the company with the expectation of increased financial returns through property improvement as of december 31 2021 the company had one consolidated development project and one unconsolidated joint venture development project comprised of 371 apartment homes for an estimated cost of 2170 million of which 610 million remains to be expended and 326 million is the companys share 

the company’s development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including among others 

• funds may be expended and managements time devoted to projects that may not be completed on time or at all 

• construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates possibly making the project economically unfeasible 

• projects may be delayed due to without limitation adverse weather conditions labor or material shortage municipal office closures and staff shortages government recommended or mandated work stoppages due to health concerns or environmental remediation 

• occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated 

• expenses at completed development or redevelopment projects may be higher than anticipated including without limitation due to costs of litigation over construction contracts by general contractors environmental remediation or increased costs for labor materials and leasing 

• we may be unable to obtain or experience a delay in obtaining necessary zoning occupancy or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations which could result in increased costs or delay or abandonment of opportunities 

• we may be unable to obtain financing with favorable terms or at all for the proposed development or redevelopment of a community which may cause us to delay or abandon an opportunity and

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to essex’s stockholders and the operating partnerships unitholders 

the geographic concentration of the company’s communities and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and operating results the company generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 from the company’s communities concentrated in southern california primarily los angeles orange san diego and ventura counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area for the year ended december 31 2021 83 of the company’s rental revenues were generated from communities located in california this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations factors that may adversely affect local market and economic conditions include regional specific acts of nature eg earthquakes fires floods etc and those other factors listed in the risk factor titled “ general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values ” and elsewhere in this item 1a 

because the company’s communities are geographically concentrated the company is exposed to greater economic concentration risks than if it owned a more geographically diverse portfolio the company is susceptible to adverse developments in california and washington economic and regulatory environments such as increases in real estate and other taxes and increased costs of complying with governmental regulations in addition the state of california is generally regarded as more litigious and more highly regulated and taxed than many states which may reduce demand for the company’s communities california has also experienced increased relocation out of the state any adverse developments in the economy or real estate markets in california or washington or any decrease in demand for the company’s communities resulting from the california or washington regulatory or business environments could have an adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company may experience various increased costs including increased property taxes to own and maintain its properties real property taxes on our properties may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change our real estate taxes in washington could increase as a result of property value reassessments or

increased property tax rates in that state a california law commonly referred to as proposition 13 generally limits annual real estate tax increases on california properties to 2 of assessed value however under proposition 13 property tax reassessment generally occurs as a result of a change in ownership of a property as specially defined for purposes of those rules because the property taxing authorities may not determine whether there has been a change in ownership or the actual reassessed value of a property for a period of time after a transaction has occurred we may not know the impact of a potential reassessment for a considerable amount of time following a particular transaction therefore the amount of property taxes we are required to pay could increase substantially from the property taxes we currently pay or have paid in the past including on a retroactive basis in addition from time to time voters and lawmakers have announced initiatives to repeal or amend proposition 13 to eliminate its application to commercial and industrial property increase the permitted annual real estate tax increases andor introduce split tax roll legislation such initiatives if successful could increase the assessed value andor tax rates applicable to commercial property in california including our apartment communities further changes in us federal tax law could cause state and local governments to alter their taxation of real property 

the company may experience increased costs associated with capital improvements and routine property maintenance such as repairs to the foundation exterior walls and rooftops of its properties as its properties advance through their lifecycles in some cases we may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or maintenance increases in the company’s expenses to own and maintain its properties could adversely impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

competition in the apartment community market and other housing alternatives may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for the company’s communities there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting tenants these include other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent or for sale in the markets in which our communities are located competitive housing in a particular area and fluctuations in cost of owneroccupied single and multifamily homes caused by a decrease in housing prices mortgage interest rates andor government programs to promote home ownership or create additional rental andor other types of housing or an increase in desire for more space due to work from home needs or increased time spent at home could adversely affect the company’s ability to retain its tenants lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents if the demand for the company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing apartment communities rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations the company also faces competition from other companies reits businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities this competition may result in an increase in prices and costs of apartment communities that the company acquires andor develops 

investments in mortgages mezzanine loans subordinated debt other real estate and other marketable securities could adversely affect the company’s cash flow from operations  the company may purchase or otherwise invest in securities issued by entities which own real estate andor invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations such mortgages may be first second or third mortgages and these mortgages andor other investments may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed the company may make or acquire mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity or entities that owns the interest in the entity owning the property in general investing in mortgages may pose some risk including but not limited to the value of mortgaged property may be less than the amounts owed causing realized or unrealized losses the borrower may not pay indebtedness under the mortgage when due requiring the company to foreclose and the amount recovered in connection with the foreclosure may be less than the amount owed that interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than the company’s cost of funds in the case of junior mortgages that foreclosure of a senior mortgage could eliminate the junior mortgage delays in the collection of principal and interest if a borrower claims bankruptcy possible senior lender default or overconcentration of senior lenders in portfolio and unanticipated early prepayments may limit the company’s expected return on its investment if any of the above were to occur it could adversely affect the company’s cash flows from operations 

the company’s ownership of coinvestments including joint ventures and joint ownership of communities its ownership of properties with shared facilities with a homeowners association or other entity its ownership of properties subject to a ground lease and its preferred equity investments and its other partial interests in entities that own communities could limit the company’s ability to control such communities and may restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in these properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated the company has entered into and may continue in the future to enter into certain coinvestments including joint ventures or partnerships through which it owns an indirect economic interest in less than 100 of the community or land or other investments owned directly by the joint venture or partnership as of december 31 2021 the company had through several joint ventures an interest in 10257 apartment homes in stabilized operating communities for a total book value of 5653 million

joint venture partners often have shared control over the development and operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company’s business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to the company’s instructions or requests or its policies or objectives consequently a joint venture partners actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives the company may be unable to take action without its joint venture partners’ approval should a joint venture partner become bankrupt the company could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities in some instances the company and the joint venture partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause the company to sell its interest or acquire a partner’s interest at a time when the company otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

from time to time the company through the operating partnership makes certain coinvestments in the form of preferred equity investments in thirdparty entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing financing or managing real property with preferred equity investments and certain other coinvestments the operating partnership’s interest in a particular entity is typically less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such coinvestment may be limited the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such coinvestment in the event that such coinvestment or the partners in such coinvestment become insolvent or bankrupt or fail to develop or operate the property in the manner anticipated and expected the operating partnership may not receive the expected return in its expected timeframe or at all and may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the coinvestment additionally the preferred return negotiated on these coinvestments may be lower than the companys cost of funds the company may also incur losses if any guarantees or indemnifications were made by the company 

the company also owns properties indirectly under downreit structures the company has entered into and in the future may enter into transactions that could require the company to pay the tax liabilities of partners that contribute assets into downreits joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within the company’s control occur although the company plans to hold the contributed assets or if such assets consist of real property defer recognition of gain on sale of such assets pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code the company can provide no assurance that the company will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they could have a material impact on its financial position 

also from time to time the company invests in properties which may be subject to certain shared facilities agreements with homeowners’ associations and other entities andor invests in properties subject to ground leases where a subtenant may have certain similar rights to that of a party under such a shared facilities agreement and the company’s ability to control expenditures make necessary repairs and control certain decisions may adversely affect the companys business financial condition and results of operations

these transactions or any other acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties in addition the integration of acquired businesses or other acquisitions may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business to integrate acquired businesses or other acquisitions we must implement our management information systems operating systems and internal controls and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations there can be no assurance that all preacquisition property due diligence will have identified all material issues that might arise with respect to such acquired business and its properties or as to any such other acquisitions any future acquisitions we make may also require significant additional debt or equity financing which in the case of debt financing would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings and in the case of equity or equitylinked financing could be dilutive to essexs stockholders and the operating partnerships unitholders additionally the value of these investments could decline for a variety of reasons these and other factors could affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property the company carries certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk as to its properties however such coverage is not fully available for all properties and as to those properties for which limited coverage is fully available it may not apply to certain claims arising from known conditions present on those properties in general in connection with the ownership direct or indirect operation financing management and development of its communities the company could be considered as the owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances present there and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities the company may also be subject to governmental fines costs related to injuries to third parties andor damage to a third partys property 

properties which we plan to acquire undergo a preacquisition phase i environmental site assessment which is intended to afford the company protection against socalled owner liability under the primary federal environmental law as well as further environmental assessment which may involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling where conditions warranting such further assessment are identified and seller’s consent is obtained despite these assessments no assurance can be given that all environmental conditions present on or beneath or emanating from a given property will be discovered or that the full nature and extent of those conditions which are discovered will be adequately ascertained and quantified 

in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings the company does so pursuant to appropriate environmental regulatory requirements with the objective of obtaining regulatory closure or a no further action determination that will allow for future use development and sale of any impacted community

years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions the company has adopted policies for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold when it is detected and to minimize any impact mold might have on tenants of the affected property however no assurance can be provided that the company has identified and responded to all mold occurrences 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as proposition 65 requiring that covered businesses provide clear and reasonable warnings before knowingly exposing persons to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke the legislation allows private persons to sue to enforce this warning requirement and recover their legal fees and costs for doing so although the company has sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements where it appears applicable we cannot assure you that the company will not be adversely affected by private enforcement litigation relating to proposition 65 

methane gas is a naturallyoccurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas particularly in the southern california coastal areas methane is a nontoxic gas but is flammable and can be explosive at sufficient concentrations when in confined spaces and exposed to an ignition source naturallyoccurring methane gas is regulated at the state and federal level as a greenhouse gas but is not otherwise regulated as a hazardous substance however some local governments such as los angeles county require that new buildings constructed in areas designated methane gas zones install detection andor venting systems radon is also a naturallyoccurring gas that is found below the surface and can pose a threat to human health requiring abatement action if present in sufficient concentration within occupied areas the company cannot assure that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane or radon gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas however the company is unaware of any pending or threatened alleged claim resulting from such matters which would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees tenants and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material in the event of a substantial loss insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full replacement cost of the company’s lost investment or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the company’s ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed in addition certain causalities andor losses incurred may expose the company in the future to higher insurance premiums 

climate change may adversely affect our business to the extent that climate change does occur we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation temperature and wild fire exposure all of which may result in physical damage or a decrease in demand for our communities located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected and may negatively impact the types and pricing of insurance the company is able to procure 

our properties are located along the west coast of the united states to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns the regions where our communities are located could experience increases in storm intensity wild fires rising sea levels andor drought frequency over time such conditions could result in reduced demand for housing in areas where our communities are located and increased costs related to further developing our communities to mitigate the effects of climate change or repairing damage related to the effects of climate change that may or may not be fully covered by insurance 

in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased operating costs for example increased utility costs andor increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing communities and could also require us to spend more on our new development communities without a corresponding increase in revenue further the impact of climate change may increase the cost of or make unavailable property insurance or other hazard insurance on terms we find acceptable or necessary to adequately protect our properties 

accidental death or severe injuries at our communities due to fires floods other natural disasters or hazards could adversely affect our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where any such events have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

table of contents 

public utilities especially those that provide water and electric power are fundamental for the consistent operation of our communities the delayed delivery or any prolonged interruption of these services may cause tenants to terminate their leases or may result in a reduction of rents andor increase in our costs or other issues in addition we may fail to provide quality housing and continuous access to amenities as a result of other factors including government mandated closures mechanical failure power outage human error vandalism physical or electronic security breaches war terrorism or similar events such events may also expose us to additional liability claims and damage our reputation and brand and could cause tenants to terminate or not renew their leases or prospective tenants to seek housing elsewhere any such failures could impair our ability to continue providing quality housing and consistent operation of our communities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

litigation or criminal penalties and that the company may be exposed to a risk of loss including without limitation loss related to the fact that agreements with such vendors or such vendors’ financial condition may not allow the company to recover all costs related to a cyber breach for which they alone or they and the company should be jointly responsible for which could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

privacy and information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies such as ransomware and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks we maintain cyber risk insurance which may provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of cyber breaches however there can be no assurance that our cyber risk insurance will be sufficient in the event of a cyber incident 

in the future the company may expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company’s information security measures to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities andor to further ensure compliance with privacy and information security laws despite these steps there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer a significant data security incident in the future that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on the company’s systems or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner any failure in or breach of the company’s information security systems those of third party service providers or a breach of other third party systems that ultimately impacts the operational or information security systems of the company as a result of cyberattacks or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business and results of operations further the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data such as phishing are increasing in sophistication and are often novel or change frequently accordingly the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures 

reliance on third party software providers to host systems critical to our operations and to provide the company with data we rely on certain key software vendors to support business practices critical to our operations including the collection of rent and ancillary income and communication with our tenants and to provide us with data including data we use to set our rents and predict occupancies the market is currently experiencing a consolidation of these software vendors particularly in the multifamily space which may negatively impact the company’s choice of vendor and pricing options moreover if any of these key vendors were to terminate our relationship or access to data or to fail we could suffer losses while we sought to replace the services and information provided by the vendors 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

capital and credit market conditions and volatility may affect the company’s access to sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could negatively affect the company’s business stock price results of operations cash flows and financial condition our current balance sheet the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a diversified bank group access to the public and private placement debt markets and secured debt financing providers such as fannie mae and freddie mac provide some insulation from volatile capital markets we primarily use external financing including sales of debt and equity securities to fund acquisitions developments and redevelopments and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our acquisition development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or distributing less than 100 of our reit taxable income in general to the extent that the company’s access to capital and credit is at a higher cost than the company has experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing without a corresponding change to investment cap rates the company’s ability to make acquisitions develop or redevelop communities obtain new financing and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates could be adversely affected which would impact the companys financial standing and related credit rating in addition if our ability to obtain financing is adversely affected the company’s stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to satisfy scheduled maturities on existing financing through other sources of our liquidity which in the case of secured financings could result in lender foreclosure on the apartment communities securing such debt 

debt financing has inherent risks at december 31 2021 the company had approximately 63 billion of indebtedness including 5656 million of variable rate indebtedness where appropriate the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on the company’s investments and to provide for additional investments that the company could not otherwise make the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including but not limited to cash flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest and the reit distribution requirements of the code inability to renew repay or refinance maturing indebtedness on encumbered apartment communities on favorable terms or at all possibly requiring the company to sell a property or properties on disadvantageous terms inability to comply with debt covenants could trigger cash management provisions limiting our ability to control cash flows cause defaults or an acceleration of maturity dates and paying debt before the scheduled maturity date could result in prepayment penalties any of these risks might result in losses that could have an adverse effect on the company and its ability to make distributions to

essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders and pay amounts due on its debt our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations working capital and capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms which in either case could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

as of december 31 2021 the company had 12 consolidated communities encumbered by debt with respect to such communities all of them are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those communities the holders of this indebtedness will have rights with respect to these communities and if debt payment obligations are not met lenders may seek foreclosure of communities or may appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies which would reduce the company’s income and net asset value and its ability to service other debt foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet reit distribution requirements 

compliance requirements of taxexempt financing and below market rent requirements may limit income from certain communities at december 31 2021 the company had approximately 2244 million of variable rate taxexempt financing this taxexempt financing provides for certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants the company expects to engage in taxexempt financings in the future if the compliance requirements of the taxexempt financing restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderate income tenants or eligiblequalified tenants then our income from these properties may be limited while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweigh any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed communities if the company is required to decrease its rental rates to attract tenants who satisfy the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for tenants satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and the company may be subject to additional contractual liability notwithstanding the limitations due to taxexempt financing requirements the income from certain communities may be limited due to below market rent requirements imposed by local authorities in connection with the original development of the community 

the indentures governing our notes and other financing arrangements contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility the indentures that govern our publicly registered notes contain financial and operating covenants that among other things restrict our ability to take specific actions even if we believe them to be in our best interests including restrictions on our ability to consummate a merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness the instruments governing our other unsecured indebtedness require us to meet specified financial covenants including covenants relating to net worth fixed charge coverage debt service coverage the amounts of total indebtedness and secured indebtedness leverage and certain investment limitations these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies our ability to comply with these provisions and those contained in the indentures governing the notes may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance changes in general business and economic conditions adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting us the breach of any of these covenants including those contained in our indentures could result in a default under our indebtedness which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable if any of our indebtedness is accelerated we may not be able to repay it 

uncertainty relating to the libor calculation process and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may materially adversely affect us the interest rate on certain of the company’s secured and unsecured debt obligations including the company’s two unsecured lines of credit is based on the libor in july 2017 the united kingdom regulator that regulates libor announced its intention to phase out libor rates by the end of 2021 on march 5 2021 the united kingdom regulator confirmed its intentions to cease the publication of the one week and two month us dollar libor immediately following the december 31 2021 publications and the remaining us dollar libor tenors immediately following the june 30 2023 publications at this time no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor and it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide libor submissions to the administrator of libor or whether any additional reforms to libor may be enacted in the united kingdom the united states or elsewhere any changes in the method used for determining libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in libor if a published us dollar libor rate is unavailable after june 2023 the interest rates on certain of the company’s debt obligations could change uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes phase out alternative reference rates or other reforms may adversely affect the trading market for liborbased securities any of these proposals or consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs and as a result our financial condition and results of operations

interest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses the company from time to time uses interest rate swaps and interest rate caps contracts to manage certain interest rate risks although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged the company may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the company to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk the company enters into hedging arrangements only with investment grade financial institutions 

a downgrade in the companys investment grade credit rating could materially and adversely affect its business and financial condition the company plans to manage its operations to maintain its investment grade credit rating with a capital structure consistent with its current profile but there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain its current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on the company’s cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on its financial condition results of operations and liquidity as well as the companys stock price 

changes in the company’s financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness the company’s organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a limit on debt financing consistent with the existing covenants required to maintain the company’s unsecured line of credit bank facility unsecured debt and senior unsecured bonds although pursuant to this policy the company manages its debt to be in compliance with the debt covenants the company may increase the amount of outstanding debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in the company’s ability to service the additional debt accordingly the company could become more leveraged resulting in an increased risk of default on its debt covenants or on its debt obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements any covenant breach or significant increase in the company’s leverage could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

if the company or any of its subsidiaries defaults on an obligation to repay outstanding indebtedness when due the default could trigger a crossdefault or crossacceleration under other indebtedness a default under the agreements governing the company’s or its subsidiaries’ indebtedness including a default under mortgage indebtedness lines of credit bank term loan or the indenture for the company’s outstanding senior notes that is not waived by the required lenders or holders of outstanding notes could trigger crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions under one or more agreements governing the company’s indebtedness which could cause an immediate default or allow the lenders to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable 

the company could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac and by changes in government support for multifamily housing historically the company has utilized borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future the company primarily utilizes unsecured debt and repays secured debt at or near its respective maturity and places less reliance on agency mortgage debt financing potential options have been proposed for the future of agency mortgage finance in the united states that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing more generally it may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect the company and its growth and operations 

risks related to personnel

risks related to taxes and status as a reit 

failure to generate sufficient rental revenue or other liquidity needs and impacts of economic conditions could limit cash flow available for dividend distributions as well as the form and timing of such distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time

the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under the maryland general corporation law as permitted by the statute the board of directors of essex irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination among the company george m marcus who is the chairman of the company and mmc or any entity owned or controlled by mr marcus and mmc consequently the fiveyear prohibition and supermajority vote requirements described above will not apply to any business combination between the company mr marcus or mmc as a result the company may in the future enter into business combinations with mr marcus and mmc without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland business combination act

the company’s charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other terms of such stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock the company may establish one or more classes or series of stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control such a transaction might involve a premium price for the company’s stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock also such a class or series of stock could have dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interests of holders of common stock 

the company’s charter contains provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock

loss of the companys reit status would have significant adverse consequences to the company and the value of the companys common stock  the company has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code the company’s qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy various annual and quarterly requirements including income asset and distribution tests established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enable it to qualify as a reit it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year the company would be subject to us federal corporate income tax on the company’s taxable income and the company could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for taxable years prior to 2018 and the company would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income the company would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to essex stockholders and operating partnership unitholders and the company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders for the purpose of maintaining reit status as a result of all these factors the company’s failure to qualify as a reit also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value and market price of the company’s common stock 

complying with reit requirements may affect our profitability and may force us to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments to qualify as a reit we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the nature and diversification of our assets the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders we may be required to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments in order to satisfy the asset and income tests or to qualify under certain statutory relief provisions we also may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution as a result having to comply with the distribution requirement could cause us to 1 sell assets in adverse market conditions 2 borrow on unfavorable terms or 3 distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt accordingly satisfying the reit requirements could materially and adversely affect us moreover if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to meet any of these asset income or distribution tests or to repay obligations to our lenders we may be unable to comply with one or more of the requirements applicable to reits or may be subject to a 100 tax on any resulting of debt accordingly satisfying the reit requirements could materially and adversely affect us moreover if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to meet any of these asset income or distribution tests or to repay obligations to our lenders we may be unable to comply with one or more of the requirements applicable to reits or may be subject to a 100 tax on any resulting gain if such sales constitute prohibited transactions 

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on the company or its stockholders the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive legislation could adversely affect the company or its stockholders new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in the company also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

the company’s ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries trss is subject to certain restrictions and it will be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on certain income or deductions if transactions with the company’s trss are not conducted on arm’s length terms the company has established several trss the trss must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income as a regular c corporation while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its trss do not adversely

affect its reit qualification it cannot provide assurances that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore the company may be subject to a 100 penalty tax to the extent dealings between the company and its trss are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature the company intends that its dealings with its trss will be on an arm’s length basis no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not assert a contrary position 

failure of one or more of the company’s subsidiaries to qualify as a reit could adversely affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit the company owns interests in multiple subsidiary reits that have elected to be taxed as reits under the code these subsidiary reits are subject to the various reit qualification requirements and other limitations that are applicable to the company if any of the company’s subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit then i the subsidiary reit would become subject to federal income tax and ii the company’s ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit would cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits if any of the company’s subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as reits it is possible that the company could also fail to qualify as a reit 

the tax imposed on reits engaging in prohibited transactions may limit the company’s ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes from time to time the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties under the code unless certain exceptions apply any gain resulting from transfers of properties that the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business could be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax from the gain on the sale of the community which could potentially adversely impact our status as a reit unless we own the community through one of our trss since the company acquires properties for investment purposes it does not believe that its occasional transfers or disposals of property should be treated as prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by the company are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then the company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to it from the prohibited transaction and the company’s ability to retain proceeds from real property sales may be jeopardized 

dividends payable by reits may be taxed at higher rates than dividends of nonreit corporations which could reduce the net cash received by stockholders and may be detrimental to the company’s ability to raise additional funds through any future sale of its stock dividends paid by reits to us stockholders that are individuals trusts or estates are generally not eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividends received from nonreit corporations us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates generally may deduct 20 of ordinary dividends from a reit for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends this may cause investors to view reit investments as less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock in reits including the companys stock 

we may face risks in connection with section 1031 exchanges from time to time we dispose of real properties in transactions intended to qualify as likekind exchanges under section 1031 of the code if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable we may face adverse consequences and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed we may not be able to dispose of real properties on a tax deferred basis 

if the operating partnership failed to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes the company could cease to qualify as a reit and suffer other adverse consequences the company believes that the operating partnership will continue to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership is not subject to us federal income tax on its income instead each of its partners is required to pay tax on the partner’s allocable share of the income of the operating partnership no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not challenge the operating partnership’s status as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the internal revenue service were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes the company could fail to meet the income tests andor the asset tests applicable to reits and accordingly cease to qualify as a reit also the failure of the operating partnership to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and distribution to its partners including us 

partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us under current federal partnership tax audit rules subject to certain exceptions any audit adjustment to items of income gain loss deduction or credit of a partnership and a partner’s allocable share thereof is determined and taxes interest and penalties attributable thereto are assessed and collected at the partnership level unless the partnership makes an election or takes certain steps to require the partners to pay their tax on their allocable shares of the adjustment it is possible that partnerships in which we directly or indirectly invest would be 

table of contents 

required to pay additional taxes interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment we as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes interest and penalties even though essex as a reit may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate‑level taxes had we owned the assets of the partnership directly the partnership tax audit rules apply to essex portfolio lp and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on us 

general risks 

we may from time to time be subject to litigation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations some of these claims may result in defense costs settlements fines or judgments against us some of which are not or cannot be covered by insurance payment of any such costs settlements fines or judgments that are not insured could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage which could adversely impact our reputation our results of operations and cash flow expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured 

rising interest rates may affect the company’s costs of capital and financing activities and results of operation and otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock interest rates could increase which could result in higher interest expense on the company’s variable rate indebtedness or increase interest rates when refinancing maturing fixed rate debt prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company’s ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with positive economic returns on investment and the company’s ability to refinance existing borrowings in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances including significant cash amounts at our wholly owned insurance subsidiary pwi as well as 401k plan assets in a limited number of financial institutions our cash balances are generally in excess of federally insured limits the failure or collapse of one or more of these financial institutions may materially adversely affect our ability to recover our cash balances or the 401k assets certain financial institutions are lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations additionally certain of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds

the company’s portfolio as of december 31 2021 including communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures but excluding communities underlying preferred equity investments was comprised of 252 stabilized operating apartment communities comprising 61911 apartment homes of which 26245 apartment homes are located in southern california 23141 apartment homes are located in northern california and 12525 apartment homes are located in the seattle metropolitan area the company’s apartment communities accounted for 993 of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 

occupancy rates 

financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental income by total scheduled rental income total scheduled rental income represents the value of all apartment homes with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents when calculating actual rents for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes delinquencies and concessions are not taken into account the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates and the companys calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy as disclosed by other reits market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes the company may increase or decrease these rates based on a variety of factors including overall supply and demand for housing concentration of new apartment deliveries within the same submarket which can cause periodic disruption due to greater rental concessions to increase leasing velocity and rental affordability 

for communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while a community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual income is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy

the covid19 pandemic 

the united states and other countries around the world are continuing to experience impacts related to the covid19 pandemic and its related variants which has created considerable instability disruption and uncertainty governmental authorities in impacted regions are taking extraordinary steps in an effort to slow down the spread of the viruses and mitigate its impact on affected populations federal state and local jurisdictions have implemented varying forms of requirements related to sponsors and patrons of public gatherings and required businesses to make changes to their operations in a manner that negatively affects profitability resulting in job losses and related financial impacts that may affect future operations to an unknown extent while the california eviction moratorium sunsetted during the third quarter of 2021 other state and local eviction moratoriums and laws that limit rent increases during times of emergency and prohibit the ability to collect unpaid rent during certain timeframes continue to be in effect in various formats at various regions in which essexs communities are located impacting essex and its properties the company is working to comply with the stated intent of local county state and federal laws in that regard the company has implemented a wide range of practices to protect and support its employees and residents such measures include instituting a hybrid work model for corporate associates to work at the companys corporate offices and remotely and transitioning many public interactions with leasing staff to online and telephonic communications 

due to the covid19 pandemic some of the companys residents their health their employment and thus their ability to pay rent have been and may continue to be impacted to support residents the company has implemented the following steps including but not limited to 

• assembling a resident response team to effectively and efficiently respond to resident needs and concerns with respect to the pandemic 

• structuring payment plans for residents who are unable to pay their rent as a result of the outbreak and waiving late fees where required or applicable for those residents and 

• establishing the essex cares fund for the purpose of supporting the company’s residents and communities that are experiencing financial hardships caused by the covid19 pandemic 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the us and world economies generally and on the companys results in particular has been and may continue to be significant the longterm impact will largely depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to whether employees and employers will continue to promote remote work if and when the pandemic concludes this includes new information which may emerge concerning the severity of covid19 and related variants the success of actions taken to contain or treat covid19 future laws that may be enacted the impact on job growth and the broader economy and reactions by consumers companies governmental entities and capital markets the labor shortage due partly to various government mandates and vaccine requirements implemented during the covid19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions may negatively impact the companys results of operations 

primarily as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic the companys cash delinquencies as a percentage of scheduled rental income for the company’s stabilized apartment communities or sameproperty stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 remained higher than the prepandemic period but improved from 25 for 2020 to 19 for 2021 the company has executed some payment plans and will continue to work with residents 

table of contents 

to collect such cash delinquencies as a result of continued analysis of the collectability of delinquencies reported delinquencies as a percentage of scheduled rent for the companys sameproperty portfolio was 20 for the year ended december 31 2021 as of december 31 2021 the delinquencies have not had a material adverse impact to the companys liquidity position 

the covid19 pandemic has not negatively impacted the companys ability to access traditional funding sources on the same or reasonably similar terms as were available in recent periods prior to the pandemic as demonstrated by the companys financing activity during the year ended december 31 2021 discussed in the “liquidity and capital resources section below the company is not at material risk of not meeting the covenants in its credit agreements and is able to timely service its debt and other obligations  

results of operations 

comparison of year ended december 31 2021 to the year ended december 31 2020 

the company’s average financial occupancy for the company’s stabilized apartment communities or 2021 sameproperty stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 increased 40 basis points to 964 in 2021 from 960 in 2020 financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental income by total scheduled rental income actual rental income represents contractual rental income pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total scheduled rental income represents the value of all apartment homes with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant apartment home at its estimated market rate 

market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes the company may increase or decrease these rates based on a variety of factors including overall supply and demand for housing concentration of new apartment deliveries within the same submarket which can cause periodic disruption due to greater rental concessions to increase leasing velocity and rental affordability financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates and the companys calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy disclosed by other reits 

the company does not take into account delinquency and concessions to calculate actual rent for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes the calculation of financial occupancy compares contractual rates for occupied apartment homes to estimated market rents for unoccupied apartment homes and thus the calculation compares the gross value of all apartment homes excluding delinquency and concessions for apartment communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while an apartment community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual income is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy 

the regional breakdown of the company’s 2021 sameproperty portfolio for financial occupancy for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 is as follows 



the following table provides a breakdown of revenue amounts including the revenues attributable to 2021 sameproperties 

table of contents 



  

2021 sameproperty revenues decreased by 162 million or 12 to 13 billion for 2021 the decrease was primarily attributable to an additional 53 million of cash concessions and 12 million in delinquencies compared to the prior year and due to a decrease of 15 in average rental rates from 2349 for 2020 to 2313 for 2021 

2021 nonsame property revenues decreased by 386 million or 212 to 1432 million in 2021 compared to 1817 million in 2020 the decrease was primarily due to property dispositions in 2020 and the sale of hidden valley axis 2300 park 20 and devonshire apartments in 2021 partially offset by the acquisition of the village at toluca lake 

management and other fees from affiliates decreased by 05 million or 52 to 91 million in 2021 from 96 million in 2020 the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenues used to calculate management fees as well as a decrease of the management fee rate for one of the joint ventures 

property operating expenses excluding real estate taxes increased by 15 million or 06 to 2649 million in 2021 compared to 2634 million in 2020 primarily due to an increase of 38 million in utilities expenses offset by a 24 million decrease in administrative expenses 2021 sameproperty operating expenses excluding real estate taxes increased by 53 million or 22 to 2418 million in 2021 compared to 2365 million in 2020 primarily due to increases of 41 million in utilities expenses 22 million in insurance and other expenses and 12 million in maintenance and repairs expenses offset by a decrease of 22 million in administrative expenses 

real estate taxes increased by 34 million or 19 to 1804 million in 2021 compared to 1770 million in 2020 primarily due to increases in assessed valuations and tax rates 2021 sameproperty real estate taxes increased by 36 million or 24 to 1550 million in 2021 compared to 1514 million in 2020 primarily due to increases in assessed valuations and tax rates 

corporatelevel property management expenses increased by 16 million or 46 to 362 million in 2021 compared to 346 million in 2020 due to costs pertaining to the centralization of certain property level functions 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 54 million or 10 to 5201 million in 2021 compared to 5255 million in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense resulting from certain lease intangibles becoming fully amortized during 2020 and the sale of hidden valley axis 2300 park 20 and devonshire apartments during 2021 

gain on sale of real estate and land of 1430 million in 2021 was attributable to the sale of hidden valley axis 2300 park 20 and devonshire apartments during 2021 the companys 650 million gain on sale of real estate and land in 2020 was primarily attributable to the portfolio sale of one south market and museum park and the sales of delano and 416 on broadway during 2020 

interest expense decreased by 175 million or 79 to 2031 million in 2021 compared to 2206 million in 2020  primarily due to various debt that was paid off matured or regular principal payments during and after 2020 and lower average interest rates which resulted in a decrease in interest expense of 498 million for 2021 these decreases in interest expense were partially offset by the issuance of new senior unsecured notes which resulted in an increase of 238 million interest expense for 2021 as compared to 2020 additionally there was a 85 million decrease in capitalized interest in 2021 due to a decrease in development activity as compared to the same period in 2020

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table sets forth the company’s cash flows for 2021 2020 and 2019  in thousands 

essex’s business is operated primarily through the operating partnership essex issues public equity from time to time but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself other than incurring certain expenses from operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the operating partnership essex itself does not hold any indebtedness and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the operating partnership essex’s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock and preferred stock essex’s sole source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the operating partnership

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities the company defines critical accounting estimates as those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the company the company’s critical accounting estimates relate principally to the following key areas i accounting for the acquisition of investments in real estate specifically the allocation between land and buildings during the 

table of contents 

year ended december 31 2020 and ii evaluation of events and changes in circumstances indicating whether the company’s rental properties may be impaired the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 

the company accounts for its acquisitions of investments in real estate by assessing each acquisition to determine if it meets the definition of a business or if it qualifies as an asset acquisition we expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions and result in the capitalization of acquisition costs and the allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair value of the respective assets and liabilities 

in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price the company utilizes a number of sources including independent land appraisals which consider comparable market transactions its own analysis of recently acquired or developed comparable properties in our portfolio for land comparables and building replacement costs and other publicly available market data in calculating the fair value of identified intangible assets of an acquired property the inplace leases are valued based on inplace rent rates and amortized over the average remaining term of all acquired leases the allocation of the total consideration exchanged for a real estate acquisition between the identifiable assets and liabilities and the depreciation we recognize over the estimated useful life of the asset could be impacted by different assumptions and estimates used in the calculation the reasonable likelihood that the estimate could have a material impact on the financial condition of the company is based on the total consideration exchanged for real estate during any given year the allocation of the value between land and building was a critical accounting estimate during the year ended december 31 2020 as result of the potential material impact of the companys acquisition of a land parcel and six communities for a total purchase price of 4634 million 

the company periodically assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments for indicators of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on monitoring investment market conditions and performance for operating properties including the net operating income for the most recent 12 month period monitoring estimated costs for properties under development the companys ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset and each propertys remaining useful life although each of these may result in an impairment indicator the shortening of an expected holding period due to the potential sale of a property is the most likely impairment indicator whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property changes in operating and market conditions may result in a change of our intent to hold the property through the end of its useful life and may impact the assumptions utilized to determine the future cash flows of the real estate investment 

the company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 

funds from operations 

funds from operations ffo is a financial measure that is commonly used in the reit industry the company presents ffo and ffo excluding noncore items referred to as core ffo as supplemental operating performance measures ffo and core ffo are not used by the company as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net income computed under us gaap as an indicator of the company’s operating performance or as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under us gaap as an indicator of the companys ability to fund its cash needs 

ffo and core ffo are not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and do not present nor do they intend to present a complete picture of the companys financial condition and operating performance the company believes that net income computed under us gaap is the primary measure of performance and that ffo and core ffo are only meaningful when they are used in conjunction with net income the company considers ffo and core ffo to be useful financial performance measurements of an equity reit because together with net income and cash flows ffo and core ffo provide investors with additional bases to evaluate operating performance and ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures and to pay dividends by excluding gains or losses related to sales of depreciated operating properties and excluding real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo can help investors compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies by further adjusting for items that are not considered part of the company’s core business operations core ffo allows investors to compare the core 

table of contents 

operating performance of the company to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the company’s actual operating results the company believes that its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 

  

in calculating ffo the company follows the definition for this measure published by nareit which is the leading reit industry association the company believes that under the nareit ffo definition the two most significant adjustments made to net income are i the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and ii the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of previously depreciated properties the company agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

  

a historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with us gaap assumes through depreciation charges that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time nareit stated in its white paper on funds from operations “since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves consequently nareit’s definition of ffo reflects the fact that real estate as an asset class generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by us gaap do not reflect the underlying economic realities 

b reits were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of longterm ownership and management of real estate the exclusion in nareit’s definition of ffo of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the longterm assets that form the core of a reit’s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 

management believes that it has consistently applied the nareit definition of ffo to all periods presented however there is judgment involved and other reits calculation of ffo may vary from the nareit definition for this measure and thus their disclosure of ffo may not be comparable to the company’s calculation

business strategies 

the following is a discussion of the company’s business strategies in regards to real estate investment and management 

business strategies 

research driven approach to investments – the company believes that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio growth begin with extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge the company continually assesses markets where the company operates as well as markets where the company considers future investment opportunities by evaluating markets and focusing on the following strategic criteria 

• major metropolitan areas that have regional population in excess of one million 

• constraints on new supply driven by i low availability of developable land sites where competing housing could be economically built ii political growth barriers such as protected land urban growth boundaries and potential lengthy and expensive development permit processes and iii natural limitations to development such as mountains or waterways 

• rental demand enhanced by affordability of rents relative to costs of forsale housing and 

• housing demand based on job growth proximity to jobs high median incomes and the quality of life including related commuting factors 

recognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical the company regularly evaluates the results of its regional economic and local market research and adjusts the geographic focus of its portfolio accordingly the company seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to decrease allocations in markets projected to have declining economic conditions likewise the company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields 

property operations – the company manages its communities by focusing on activities that may generate aboveaverage rental growth tenant retentionsatisfaction and longterm asset appreciation the company intends to achieve this by utilizing the strategies set forth below 

• property management   – oversee delivery and quality of the housing provided to our tenants and manage the properties financial performance

 item 1a risk factors 

for purposes of this section the term stockholders means the holders of shares of essex property trust inc’s common stock set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to essex property trust inc’s stockholders and essex portfolio lp’s unitholders you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our company our properties and our business 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual operating results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

risks related to our real estate investments and operations 

general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks if the communities and other real estate investments do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and the ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders will be adversely affected income from the communities may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

• changes in the general or local economic climate including layoffs plant closings industry slowdowns relocations of significant local employers and other events negatively impacting local employment rates and wages and the local economy 

• local economic conditions in which the communities are located such as oversupply of housing or a reduction in demand for rental housing 

• adverse economic or market conditions due to the covid19 pandemic leading to a temporary or permanent move by tenants andor prospective tenants from locations in which our communities are located 

• the attractiveness and desirability of our communities to tenants including without limitation the size and amenity offerings of our units our technology offerings and our ability to identify and cost effectively implement new relevant technologies and to keep up with constantly changing consumer demand for the latest innovations including any increased requirements due to the significant increase in the number of people who continue to “work from home” 

• inflationary environments in which the costs to operate and maintain communities increase at a rate greater than our ability to increase rents or deflationary environments where we may be exposed to declining rents more quickly under our shortterm leases 

• competition from other available housing alternatives 

• changes in rent control or stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing and other increasing regulations on people and businesses in locations where our communicates are located 

• the company’s ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance 

• declines in the financial condition of our tenants which may make it more difficult for us to collect rents from some tenants 

• any decline in or tenants perceptions of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our communities and the neighborhoods where they are located and 

• changes in interest rates and availability of financing 

as leases at the communities expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to the company income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws including without limitation the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the disabilities act fair housing amendment act of 1988 the fhaa permanent and temporary rent control laws rent stabilization laws other laws regulating housing that may prevent the company from raising rents to offset increased operating expenses and tax laws 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents and the company may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less if the company is unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then the company’s results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected with these short term leases our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

national and regional economic environments can negatively impact the company’s liquidity and operating results the companys forecast for the national economy assumes growth of the gross domestic product of the national economy and the economies of the west coast states in the event of a recession or other negative economic effects including as a result of the covid19 pandemic the company could incur reductions in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising and turnover expenses any such recession or similar event may affect consumer confidence and spending and negatively impact the volume and pricing of real estate transactions which could negatively affect 

the company’s liquidity and its ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes to the economy furthermore if residents do not experience increases in their income they may be unable or unwilling to pay rent increases and delinquencies in rent payments and rent defaults may increase 

rent control or other changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect the companys operations or expose us to liability the company must own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop its properties in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes rent control or stabilization laws laws benefiting disabled persons federal state and local tax laws landlord tenant laws environmental laws employment laws immigration laws and other laws regulating housing or that are generally applicable to the companys business and operations noncompliance with laws could expose the company to liability if the company does not comply with any or all of these requirements it may have to pay fines to government authorities or damage awards to private litigants andor may have to decrease rents in order to comply with such requirements the company does not know whether these requirements will change or whether new requirements will be imposed changes in or noncompliance with these regulatory requirements could require the company to make significant unanticipated expenditures to address noncompliance which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition rent control or rent stabilization laws and other regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to increase rents and pass through new or increased operating costs to our tenants there has been a recent increase in municipalities including those in which we own properties considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions which could limit our ability to raise rents based solely on market conditions these initiatives and any other future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing as well as any lawsuits against the company arising from such rent control or other laws may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs such laws and regulations limit our ability to charge market rents increase rents evict tenants or recover increases in our operating expenses and could reduce the value of our communities or make it more difficult for us to dispose of properties in certain circumstances expenses associated with our investment in these communities such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from the community furthermore such regulations may negatively impact our ability to attract higherpaying tenants to such communities 

the current covid19 pandemic or the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases and the timing and effectiveness of vaccine distribution could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the outbreak of covid19 which is present in nearly all regions around the world including the united states and the specific regions in which our apartment communities are located has created considerable instability and disruption in the us and world economies considerable uncertainty still surrounds covid19 including when the pandemic will conclude how quickly vaccines can be safely and widely distributed the effectiveness of such vaccines and the potential shortterm and longterm effects including but not limited to shifts in consumer housing demand based on geography affordability housing type eg multifamily vs singlefamily and unit type eg studio vs multibedroom mainly resulting from the paradigm shift of work culture the decentralization of corporate headquarters and the success of “work from home” models moreover local state and national measures taken to limit the spread of covid19 including “social distancing” and other restrictions on travel congregation and business operations have already resulted in significant negative economic impacts the prolonged impact of covid19 on the us and world economies remains uncertain but has resulted in increased health issues and mortality rates increased unemployment and a worldwide economic downturn the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted the extent to which the company’s financial condition or operating results will continue to be affected by the covid19 pandemic will largely depend on future demand and developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted 

the company’s operating results depend in large part on revenues derived from leasing space in our apartment communities to residential tenants and the ability of tenants to generate sufficient income to pay their rents in a timely manner the market and economic challenges created by the covid19 pandemic and measures implemented to prevent its spread have and may continue to adversely affect our returns and profitability as a result our ability to make distributions to essex’s stockholders and the operating partnership’s unitholders may be compromised and we could experience volatility with respect to the market value of our properties and common stock and operating partnership units the spread of covid19 has resulted in increases in unemployment and mass layoffs and some tenants have experienced deteriorating financial conditions and are unwilling or unable to pay all or part of their rent on a timely basis or at all and the continued spread of covid19 as well as a sustained economic downturn may result in further increases or sustainment of these situations in some cases we may be legally required to or otherwise agree to restructure tenants’ rent obligations and may not be able to do so on terms as favorable to us as those currently in place furthermore various city county and state laws restricting rent increases in times of emergency 

have come into effect in connection with the covid19 pandemic and numerous state local federal and industryinitiated efforts have and may continue to affect our ability to collect rent or enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent including among others limitations or prohibitions on evicting tenants unwilling or unable to pay rent and prohibitions on the ability to collect unpaid rent during certain timeframes additionally eviction moratoriums have passed in various formats at every level of government and while the company strives to comply given some of the conflicting standards and unclear requirements strict compliance might be difficult some residents’ views about their obligations to pay rent even when financially capable of meeting their rent obligation have shifted away from viewing rent as a primary and necessary financial obligation and this shift may continue or worsen as a result of the eviction moratoriums and the various laws affecting our abilities to collect rent in the event of tenant nonpayment default or bankruptcy we may incur costs in protecting our investment and releasing our property and have limited ability to renew existing leases or sign new leases at projected rents 

our properties may also incur significant costs or losses related to legislative mandates including shelterinplace orders business shutdowns quarantines infection or other related factors which may result in a negative impact on our occupancy levels for example many companies initially required and now are continuing to allow or require employees to “work from home” for an extended period of time causing some tenants to move away from the urban centers temporarily or permanently some businesses have been ordered to temporarily shut down such as indoor dining and many have permanently closed due to deteriorating economic conditions which has contributed to the shuttering of some commercial spaces in downtown areas and the temporary or possibly permanent deterioration of neighborhoods in and around some of our urban communities which may be further worsened by increases in homelessness and crime as a result of the effects of the pandemic on some individuals and communities moreover we typically conduct aspects of our leasing activity onsite at our apartment communities reductions in the ability and willingness of prospective residents to visit our communities due to the covid19 pandemic could reduce rental revenue and ancillary operating revenue produced by our properties additionally in connection with an outbreak that directly impacts one or more of our corporate offices or apartment communities we may experience negative publicity andor an unwillingness of prospective residents to visit or ultimately choose to live in our communities which could directly affect our rental revenue in addition we have incurred costs associated with protecting our employees and residents including the purchase of personal protective equipment and disinfecting our properties and those costs may continue to increase there may also be an increased risk of material litigation due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic including litigation brought by our residents or employees to the extent our management or personnel are impacted in significant numbers by the covid19 pandemic and are not available or allowed to conduct work our business and operating results may be negatively impacted additionally our corporate offices remain closed as we have instituted “work from home” measures for our corporate associates which may impact productivity and our employees’ overall mental health 

additionally market fluctuations as a result of the covid19 pandemic may affect our ability to obtain necessary funds for our operations from current lenders or new borrowings we may be unable to obtain financing for the acquisition of investments or refinancing for existing assets on satisfactory terms or at all in addition moratoriums on construction and macroeconomic factors have caused some construction delays and may cause construction contractors to be unable to perform and governmental inspections and approvals to be delayed or postponed which may cause the delivery date of certain development projects or investments in thirdparty development projects to be materially extended market fluctuations and construction delays experienced by the company’s thirdparty mezzanine loan borrowers and preferred equity investment sponsors may also negatively impact their ability to repay the company further while the company carries general liability pollution and property insurance along with other insurance policies that may provide some coverage for any losses or costs incurred in connection with the covid19 pandemic given the novelty of the issue and the scale of losses incurred throughout the world there is no guarantee that we will be able to recover all or any portion of our losses and costs under these policies we may be additionally impacted by changes in legislation relating to insurance coverages with respect to the pandemic including but not limited to workers’ compensation the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or any other related matters could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the global impact of the covid19 pandemic continues to evolve rapidly and the extent of its effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the duration scope and severity of the pandemic the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact the timing of distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and the willingness and ability of the public to get vaccinated in a timely manner and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and related containment measures among others however the covid19 pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our business financial condition and results of operations moreover to the extent any of these risks and uncertainties adversely impact us in the ways described above or otherwise they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth in this annual report on form 10k in addition if in the future there is a further outbreak of covid19 or a variation thereof an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease or other health concern the company and our properties may be subject to similar risks as posed by covid19 

acquisitions of communities involve various risks and uncertainties and may fail to meet expectations the company intends to continue to acquire apartment communities however there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet the company’s expectations the company’s estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow the company to market an acquired apartment community as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate uncertainty related to the unknown short and longterm economic and behavioral impacts of the covid19 pandemic make forecasting rental rates and occupancies more difficult and assets the company acquires may not perform as expected in addition following an acquisition the value and operational performance of an apartment community may be diminished if obsolescence or neighborhood changes occur before we are able to redevelop or sell the community also in connection with such acquisitions we may assume unknown liabilities which could ultimately lead to material costs for us that we did not expect to incur the company expects to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or joint ventures or additional equity by the company the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the company’s existing stockholders if the company finances new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless the company obtains substitute financing the company may not be able to undertake additional borrowing for further acquisitions or developments or such borrowing may be not available on advantageous terms 

development and redevelopment activities may be delayed not completed andor not achieve expected results the company pursues development and redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals which have no assurance of being received andor the timing of which may be delayed from the company’s expectations the company defines development projects as new communities that are being constructed or are newly constructed and are in a phase of leaseup and have not yet reached stabilized operations and redevelopment projects as existing properties owned or recently acquired that have been targeted for additional investment by the company with the expectation of increased financial returns through property improvement as of december 31 2020 the company had three consolidated development projects and three unconsolidated joint venture development projects comprised of 1853 apartment homes for an estimated cost of 11 billion of which 1740 million remains to be expended and 1180 million is the companys share in addition at december 31 2020 the company had ownership interests in three major redevelopment projects aggregating 1112 apartment homes with estimated redevelopment costs of 1091 million of which approximately 45 million remains to be expended 

the company’s development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including among others 

• funds may be expended and managements time devoted to projects that may not be completed on time or at all 

• construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates possibly making the project economically unfeasible 

• projects may be delayed due to without limitation adverse weather conditions labor or material shortage municipal office closures and staff shortages government recommended or mandated work stoppages due to health concerns or environmental remediation 

• occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated 

• expenses at completed development or redevelopment projects may be higher than anticipated including without limitation due to costs of litigation over construction contracts by general contractors environmental remediation or increased costs for labor materials and leasing 

• we may be unable to obtain or experience a delay in obtaining necessary zoning occupancy or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations which could result in increased costs or delay or abandonment of opportunities 

• we may be unable to obtain financing with favorable terms or at all for the proposed development or redevelopment of a community which may cause us to delay or abandon an opportunity and 

• we may incur liabilities to third parties during the development process for example in connection with managing existing improvements on the site prior to tenant terminations and demolition such as commercial space or in connection with providing services to third parties such as the construction of shared infrastructure or other improvements 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to essex’s stockholders and the operating partnerships unitholders further the development and redevelopment of communities is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see the risk factor above titled  general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values 

our apartment communities may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities which could cause us to incur substantial costs the properties that the company owns or may acquire are or may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which the company may have no recourse or only limited recourse against the sellers in general the representations and 

warranties provided under the transaction agreements related to the sales of the properties may not survive the closing of the transactions while the company seeks to require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive such indemnification may be limited and subject to various materiality thresholds a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses as a result there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties in addition the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with apartment communities may exceed our expectations and we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the geographic concentration of the company’s communities and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and operating results the company generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 from the company’s communities concentrated in southern california primarily los angeles orange santa barbara san diego and ventura counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area for the year ended december 31 2020 81 of the company’s rental revenues were generated from communities located in california this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations in general factors that may adversely affect local market and economic conditions include among others the following 

• the economic climate which may be adversely impacted by a reduction in job growth or income levels industry slowdowns changing demographics and other factors 

• local conditions such as oversupply of or reduced demand for apartment homes 

• rent control or stabilization laws or other laws regulating rental housing which could prevent the company from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs or the inability or unwillingness of tenants to pay rent increases 

• competition from other available apartments and other housing alternatives and changes in market rental rates 

• economic conditions that could cause an increase in our operating expenses including increases in property taxes utilities and routine maintenance and 

• regional specific acts of nature eg earthquakes fires floods etc 

because the company’s communities are primarily located in southern california northern california and the seattle metropolitan area the company is exposed to greater economic concentration risks than if it owned a more geographically diverse portfolio the company is susceptible to adverse developments in california and washington economic and regulatory environments such as increases in real estate and other taxes and increased costs of complying with governmental regulations in addition the state of california is generally regarded as more litigious and more highly regulated and taxed than many states which may reduce demand for the company’s communities recently california has also experienced increased relocation out of the state including as a result of the regulatory landscape and the covid19 pandemic any adverse developments in the economy or real estate markets in california or washington or any decrease in demand for the company’s communities resulting from the california or washington regulatory or business environments could have an adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company may experience various increased costs including increased property taxes to own and maintain its properties real property taxes on our properties may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change our real estate taxes in washington could increase as a result of property value reassessments or increased property tax rates in that state a current california law commonly referred to as proposition 13 generally limits annual real estate tax increases on california properties to 2 of assessed value however under proposition 13 property tax reassessment generally occurs as a result of a change in ownership of a property as specially defined for purposes of those rules because the property taxing authorities may not determine whether there has been a change in ownership or the actual reassessed value of a property for a period of time after a transaction has occurred we may not know the impact of a potential reassessment for a considerable amount of time following a particular transaction therefore the amount of property taxes we are required to pay could increase substantially from the property taxes we currently pay or have paid in the past including on a retroactive basis in addition from time to time voters and lawmakers have announced initiatives to repeal or amend proposition 13 to eliminate its application to commercial and industrial property andor introduce split tax roll legislation such initiatives if successful could increase the assessed value andor tax rates applicable to commercial property in california including our apartment communities further changes in us federal tax law could cause state and local governments to alter their taxation of real property 

the company may experience increased costs associated with capital improvements and routine property maintenance such as repairs to the foundation exterior walls and rooftops of its properties as its properties advance through their lifecycles in some cases we may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or maintenance increases in the 

company’s expenses to own and maintain its properties could adversely impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

competition in the apartment community market and other housing alternatives may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for the company’s communities there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting tenants these include other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent or for sale in the markets in which our communities are located competitive housing in a particular area and fluctuations in cost of owneroccupied single and multifamily homes caused by a decrease in housing prices mortgage interest rates andor government programs to promote home ownership or create additional rental andor other types of housing or an increase in desire for more space due to work from home needs or increased time spent at home due to covid19 could adversely affect the company’s ability to retain its tenants lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents if the demand for the company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing apartment communities rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations the company also faces competition from other companies reits businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities this competition may result in an increase in prices and costs of apartment communities that the company acquires andor develops 

investments in mortgages mezzanine loans subordinated debt other real estate and other marketable securities could adversely affect the company’s cash flow from operations the company may purchase or otherwise invest in securities issued by entities which own real estate andor invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations such mortgages may be first second or third mortgages and these mortgages andor other investments may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed the company may make or acquire mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity or entities that owns the interest in the entity owning the property in general investments in mortgages include the following risks 

• that the value of mortgaged property may be less than the amounts owed causing realized or unrealized losses 

• the borrower may not pay indebtedness under the mortgage when due requiring the company to foreclose and the amount recovered in connection with the foreclosure may be less than the amount owed 

• that interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than the company’s cost of funds 

• in the case of junior mortgages that foreclosure of a senior mortgage could eliminate the junior mortgage 

• delays in the collection of principal and interest if a borrower claims bankruptcy and 

• unanticipated early prepayments may limit the company’s expected return on its investment 

if any of the above were to occur it could adversely affect the company’s cash flows from operations 

the company’s ownership of coinvestments including joint ventures and joint ownership of communities its ownership of properties with shared facilities with a homeowners association or other entity its ownership of properties subject to a ground lease and its preferred equity investments and its other partial interests in entities that own communities could limit the company’s ability to control such communities and may restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in these properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated 

the company has entered into and may continue in the future to enter into certain coinvestments including joint ventures or partnerships through which it owns an indirect economic interest in less than 100 of the community or land or other investments owned directly by the joint venture or partnership as of december 31 2020 the company had through several joint ventures an interest in 8652 apartment homes in stabilized operating communities for a total book value of 3583 million 

joint venture partners often have shared control over the development and operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company’s business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to the company’s instructions or requests or its policies or objectives consequently a joint venture partners actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives the company may be unable to take action without its joint venture partners’ approval a joint venture partner might fail to approve decisions that are in the company’s best interests should a joint venture partner become bankrupt the company could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities in some instances the company and the joint venture partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause the company to sell its interest or acquire a partner’s interest at a time when the company otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

from time to time the company through the operating partnership invests in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing financing or managing real property the company makes certain coinvestments in the form of preferred equity investments in third party entities that own real estate with preferred equity investments and certain other coinvestments the operating partnership’s interest in a particular entity is typically less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such coinvestment may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such coinvestment in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership’s objectives the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such coinvestment in the event that such coinvestment or the partners in such coinvestment become insolvent or bankrupt or fail to develop or operate the property in the manner anticipated and expected the operating partnership may not receive the expected return in its expected timeframe or at all and may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the coinvestment additionally the preferred return negotiated on these coinvestments may be lower than the companys cost of funds the company may also incur losses if any guarantees or indemnifications were made by the company 

the company also owns properties indirectly under downreit structures the company has entered into and in the future may enter into transactions that could require the company to pay the tax liabilities of partners that contribute assets into downreits joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within the company’s control occur although the company plans to hold the contributed assets or if such assets consist of real property defer recognition of gain on sale of such assets pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code the company can provide no assurance that the company will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they could have a material impact on its financial position 

also from time to time the company invests in properties which may be subject to certain shared facilities agreements with homeowners associations and other entities andor invests in properties subject to ground leases where a subtenant may have certain similar rights to that of a party under such a shared facilities agreement for such properties the companys ability to control the expenditure of capital improvements and its allocation with such other parties may adversely affect the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

we may pursue acquisitions of other reits and real estate companies which may not yield anticipated results and could adversely affect our results of operations we may make acquisitions of andor investments in other reits and real estate companies that offer properties and communities to augment our market coverage or enhance our property offerings we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition investment alliance or joint venture opportunities that we will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us or that such transactions or relationships will be successful in addition our original estimates and assumptions used in assessing any acquisition may be inaccurate and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such acquisition 

these transactions or any other acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties for example as a consequence of such transactions we may assume unknown liabilities which could ultimately lead to material costs for us in addition the integration of acquired businesses or other acquisitions may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business to integrate acquired businesses or other acquisitions we must implement our management information systems operating systems and internal controls and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations the expected synergies from acquisitions may not be fully realized which could result in increased costs or other issues and have an adverse effect on our business there can be no assurance that all preacquisition property due diligence will have identified all material issues that might arise with respect to such acquired business and its properties or as to any such other acquisitions any future acquisitions we make may also require significant additional debt or equity financing which in the case of debt financing would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings and in the case of equity or equitylinked financing could be dilutive to essexs stockholders and the operating partnerships unitholders additionally the value of these investments could decline for a variety of reasons these and other factors could affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore the companys ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be limited real estate investments are illiquid and in our markets can at times be difficult to sell at prices we find acceptable we may be unable to consummate dispositions of properties or interests in properties in a timely manner on attractive terms or at all these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition if 

we are found to have held acquired or developed a community as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business federal tax laws may limit our ability to sell the community without incurring a 100 tax on the gain on the sale of the community and potentially adversely impacting our status as a reit unless we own the community through one of our taxable reit subsidiaries trss 

the company may not be able to lease its retailcommercial space consistent with its projections or at market rates the company has retailcommercial space in its portfolio which represents approximately 1 of our total revenue the retailcommercial space at our properties among other things serves as an additional amenity for our tenants the long term nature of our retailcommercial leases and the characteristics of many of our retailcommercial tenants small local businesses may subject us to certain risks we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or at market rates and the longer term leases for existing space could result in below market rents over time also when leases for our existing retailcommercial space expire the space may not be relet on a timely basis or at all or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retailcommercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retailcommercial tenants experience long term governmentmandated closures of their businesses or other substantial restrictions on their operations due to the impact of covid19 or otherwise financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s portfolio may have environmental liabilities under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we have been required and may be required in the future regardless of our knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases naturally occurring substances such as methane and radon gas we may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for response costs property damage personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the impacts resulting from such releases while the company is unaware of any such response action required or damage claims associated with its existing properties which individually or in aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations potential future costs and damage claims may be substantial and could exceed any insurance coverage we may have for such events or such coverage may not exist further the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate any such impacts may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the impacted property in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of responding to hazardous or toxic substance or petroleum product releases 

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property the company carries certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk as to its properties however such coverage is not fully available for all properties and as to those properties for which limited coverage is fully available it may not apply to certain claims arising from known conditions present on those properties in general in connection with the ownership direct or indirect operation financing management and development of its communities the company could be considered as the owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances present there and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities the company may also be subject to governmental fines costs related to injuries to third parties andor damage to a third partys property 

properties which we plan to acquire undergo a preacquisition phase i environmental site assessment which is intended to afford the company protection against socalled owner liability under the primary federal environmental law as well as further environmental assessment which may involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling where conditions warranting such further assessment are identified and seller’s consent is obtained despite these assessments no assurance can be given that all environmental conditions present on or beneath or emanating from a given property will be discovered or that the full nature and extent of those conditions which are discovered will be adequately ascertained and quantified 

in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings the company does so pursuant to appropriate environmental regulatory requirements with the objective of obtaining regulatory closure or a no further action determination that will allow for future use development and sale of any impacted community 

certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials acms into the air or exposure to leadbased paint lbp and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of apartment communities for personal injury associated with acms or lbp 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed in a timely manner although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions the company has adopted policies for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold when it is detected and to minimize any impact mold might have on tenants of the affected property the company believes its mold policies and proactive response to address any known mold existence reduce its risk of loss from these cases however no assurance can be provided that the company has identified and responded to all mold occurrences 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as proposition 65 requiring that covered businesses provide clear and reasonable warnings before knowingly exposing persons to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke the legislation allows private persons to sue to enforce this warning requirement and recover their legal fees and costs for doing so although the company has sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements where it appears applicable we cannot assure you that the company will not be adversely affected by private enforcement litigation relating to proposition 65 

methane gas is a naturallyoccurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas particularly in the southern california coastal areas methane is a nontoxic gas but is flammable and can be explosive at sufficient concentrations when in confined spaces and exposed to an ignition source naturallyoccurring methane gas is regulated at the state and federal level as a greenhouse gas but is not otherwise regulated as a hazardous substance however some local governments such as los angeles county require that new buildings constructed in areas designated methane gas zones install detection andor venting systems radon is also a naturallyoccurring gas that is found below the surface and can pose a threat to human health requiring abatement action if present in sufficient concentration within occupied areas the company cannot assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane or radon gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas 

we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental matters will not affect our ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations however the company is unaware of any pending or threatened alleged claim resulting from such matters which would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the company may incur general uninsured losses or may experience market conditions that impact the procurement of certain insurance policies the company purchases general liability and property including loss of rent insurance coverage for each of its communities the company may also purchase limited earthquake terrorism environmental and flood insurance for some of its communities however there are types of losses generally catastrophic in nature such as losses due to wars acts of terrorism earthquakes pollution environmental matters or extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes fires and floods that are uninsurable or not economically insurable or may be insured subject to limitations such as large deductibles or copayments insurance risks associated with potential terrorist acts could sharply increase the premiums the company pays for coverage against property and casualty claims the company utilizes a wholly owned insurance subsidiary pacific western insurance llc pwi to selfinsure certain earthquake and property losses for some of the communities in its portfolio as of december 31 2020 pwi which is consolidated in the companys financial statements had cash and marketable securities of approximately 1528 million the value of the marketable securities of pwi could decline and if a decline in value were to occur pwis ability to cover all or any portion of the amount of any insured losses could be adversely affected 

all of our communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity the company evaluates its financial loss exposure to seismic events by using actuarial loss models developed by the insurance industry and property vulnerability analyses based on structural evaluations by seismic consultants the company manages this exposure where considered appropriate desirable and costeffective by upgrading properties to increase their resistance to forces caused by seismic events by considering available funds and coverages provided by pwi andor in some cases by purchasing seismic insurance purchasing seismic insurance coverage can be costly and such seismic insurance is in limited supply as a result the company may experience a shortage in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of the insurance makes it in managements view not economically practical the company may purchase limited earthquake insurance for certain highdensity properties and in most cases properties owned by the companys coinvestments 

the company carries other types of insurance coverage related to a variety of risks and exposures including cyber risk insurance there has been a reduction in the number of insurance companies in the market offering certain types of insurance the company has previously purchased and premiums have materially increased for certain types of insurance coverage based on market conditions the company may change or potentially eliminate insurance coverages or increase levels of selfinsurance further we cannot assure you that the company will not incur losses which could be material due to uninsured risks deductibles and selfinsured retentions andor losses in excess of coverage limits 

we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets such as the metropolitan markets in southern california northern california and seattle these markets may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our communities both physically and financially or cause losses that exceed our insurance coverage our communities could also directly or indirectly be the location or target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks crimes shootings other acts of violence or other incidents beyond our control the occurrence of which could directly impact the value of our communities through damage destruction loss or increased security costs as well as operational losses due to reduction of traffic and rental demand for our communities and the availability of insurance for such acts may be limited or may be subject to substantial costs if such an incident were to occur at one of our communities we may also be subject to significant liability claims such events and losses could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and materially impair our ability to achieve our expected results additionally we may be obligated to continue to pay any mortgage indebtedness and other obligations relating to affected properties 

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees tenants and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material in the event of a substantial loss insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full replacement cost of the company’s lost investment or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the company’s ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed in addition certain causalities andor losses incurred may expose the company in the future to higher insurance premiums 

climate change may adversely affect our business to the extent that climate change does occur we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage or a decrease in demand for our communities located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected and may negatively impact the types and pricing of insurance the company is able to procure 

our properties are located along the west coast of the united states to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns the regions where our communities are located could experience increases in storm intensity rising sea levels andor drought frequency over time such conditions could result in reduced demand for housing in areas where our communities are located and increased costs related to further developing our communities to mitigate the effects of climate change or repairing damage related to the effects of climate change that may or may not be fully covered by insurance 

in addition changes in federal state and local legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased operating costs for example increased utility costs andor increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing communities and could also require us to spend more on our new development communities without a corresponding increase in revenue for example various federal regional and state laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions including the california energy efficiency standards referred to as title 24 or the building energy efficiency standards among other things green building codes may seek to reduce emissions through the imposition of standards for design construction materials water and energy usage and efficiency and waste management the imposition of such requirements in the future could increase the costs of maintaining or improving our existing properties or developing properties for example requiring retrofits of existing properties to improve their energy efficiency andor resistance to inclement weather without creating corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our operating results further the impact of climate change may increase the cost of or make unavailable property insurance or other hazard insurance on terms we find acceptable or necessary to adequately protect our properties 

accidental death or severe injuries at our communities due to fires floods other natural disasters or hazards could adversely affect our business and results of operations the accidental death or severe injuries of persons living in our communities due to fires floods other natural disasters or hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience 

difficulty marketing communities where any such events have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

adverse changes in laws may adversely affect the companys liabilities andor operating costs relating to its properties and its operations increases in real estate taxes and income service and transfer taxes cannot always be passed through to tenants or users in the form of higher rents and may adversely affect the companys cash available for distribution and its ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders and pay amounts due on its debts similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability of the company andor its operating costs on a range of issues including those regarding potential liability for other environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions as well as changes in laws affecting development construction and safety requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures including without limitation those related to structural or seismic retrofit or more costly operational safety systems and programs which could have a material adverse effect on the company for example 1 the california statute the sustainable communities and climate protection act of 2008 also known as sb375 provides that in order to reduce greenhouse emissions there should be regional planning to coordinate housing needs with regional transportation and such planning could lead to restrictions on or increases in property development that adversely affect the company and 2 the environmental protection agency has implemented a program for longterm phase out of hcfc22 coolant freon by 2030 which could lead to increased capital andor operating costs 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit the company’s growth the company may make acquisitions or commence development activity outside of its existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise the company’s historical experience in its existing markets does not ensure that it will be able to operate successfully in new markets the company may be exposed to a variety of risks if it chooses to enter new markets these risks include among others 

• an inability to evaluate accurately local apartment market conditions and local economies 

• an inability to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities or to obtain land for development 

• an inability to hire and retain key personnel and 

• lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to the fair value of tangible and intangible assets and the carrying value of our real estate investments often these estimates require the use of local market knowledge and data that is difficult to assess as well as estimates of future cash flows associated with our real estate investments that can also be difficult to accurately predict the uncertainty surrounding the short and longterm impacts of covid19 have increased the difficulty in preparing these estimates although our management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

our business and reputation depend on our ability to continue providing high quality housing and consistent operation of our communities the failure of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our business and reputation depend on providing tenants with quality housing with highly reliable services including with respect to water and electric power along with the consistent operation of our communities including a wide variety of amenities such as covered parking swimming pools clubhouses with fitness facilities playground areas tennis courts and similar features public utilities especially those that provide water and electric power are fundamental for the consistent operation of our communities the delayed delivery or any material reduction or prolonged interruption of these services may cause tenants to terminate their leases or may result in a reduction of rents andor increase in our costs or other issues in addition we may fail to provide quality housing and continuous access to amenities as a result of other factors including government mandated closures due to health concerns mechanical failure power outage human error vandalism physical or electronic security breaches war terrorism or similar events additionally residents may choose not to use such facilities or amenities as a matter of social distancing or for other reasons which may cause our communities to become less appealing to such residents such service interruptions closures or lack of use of facilities mechanical failures or other events may also expose us to additional liability claims and damage our reputation and brand and could cause tenants to terminate or not renew their leases or prospective tenants to seek housing elsewhere any such failures could impair our ability to continue providing quality housing and consistent operation of our communities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap factors considered in evaluating impairment of the company’s existing multifamily real estate assets held for investment 

include significant declines in property operating profits recurring property operating losses and other significant adverse changes in general market conditions that are considered permanent in nature generally a multifamily real estate asset held for investment is not considered impaired if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows of the asset over its estimated holding period are in excess of the asset’s net book value at the balance sheet date assumptions used to estimate annual and residual cash flow and the estimated holding period of such assets require the judgment of management there can be no assurance that the company will not take charges in the future related to the impairment of the company’s assets any future impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which may preclude our developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair value of our land holdings which we determine is less that the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment changes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or breach of the company’s privacy or information security systems or those of our vendors or other third parties could materially adversely affect the company’s business and financial condition the protection of tenant employee and company data is critically important to the company we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records personally identifiable information and tenant and lease data our business requires us including some of our vendors to use and store personally identifiable and other sensitive information of our tenants and employees the collection and use of personally identifiable information is governed by federal and state laws and regulations privacy and information security laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another the company endeavors to ensure compliance with all such laws and regulations including by providing required disclosures promptly responding to consumer requests for data and seeking vendor compliance with applicable privacy and information security laws compliance with all such laws and regulations may increase the company’s operating costs and adversely impact the company’s ability to market the company’s properties and services 

although we have taken steps to abide by privacy and security laws and to protect the security of our information systems and maintain confidential tenant prospective tenant and employee information the compliance and security measures put in place by the company and such vendors cannot guarantee perfect compliance or provide absolute security and the company and our vendors compliance systems andor information technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to criminal cyberattacks or data security incidents including ransom of data such as without limitation tenant andor employee information due to employee error malfeasance or other vulnerabilities any such incident could compromise the company’s or such vendors networks or the networks or systems of third parties that facilitate the company’s or such vendors’ business activities and the information stored by the company or such vendors could be accessed misused publicly disclosed corrupted lost or stolen resulting in fraud including wire fraud related to company assets or other harm moreover if there is a compliance failure or if a data security incident or breach affects the company’s systems or such vendors systems whether through a breach of the company’s systems or a breach of the systems of third parties or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information the company’s reputation and brand could be materially damaged which could increase our costs in attracting and retaining tenants and other serious consequences may result such potential other consequences include without limitation that the company and certain executive officers may be exposed to a risk of litigation and possible liability including without limitation government enforcement actions and private litigation and that the company may be exposed to a risk of loss including without limitation loss related to the fact that agreements with such vendors or such vendors financial condition may not allow the company to recover all costs related to a cyber breach for which they alone or they and the company should be jointly responsible for which could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

privacy and information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies such as ransomware and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks in light of the increased risks we have dedicated additional company resources to strengthening the security of the company’s computer systems including maintaining cyber risk insurance which may provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of cyber breaches however there can be no assurance that our cyber risk insurance will be sufficient in the event of a cyber incident 

in the future the company may expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company’s information security measures to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities andor to further ensure compliance with privacy and information security laws despite these steps there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer a significant data security incident in the future that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on the company’s systems or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner any failure in or breach of the companys information security systems those of third party service providers or a breach of other third party systems that ultimately impacts the operational or information security systems of the company as a result of cyberattacks or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business and results of operations additionally government agencies involved in investigating any potential data security incidents may impose injunctive relief or other civil or criminal penalties on the company andor certain executives which could among other things divert the attention of management impact the companys ability to collect and use tenant information materially increase data security costs andor otherwise require us to alter how we operate our business further the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data such as phishing and other forms of human engineering are increasing in sophistication and are often novel or change frequently accordingly the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures 

reliance on third party software providers to host systems critical to our operations and to provide the company with data we rely on certain key software vendors to support business practices critical to our operations including the collection of rent and ancillary income and communication with our tenants and to provide us with data including data we use to set our rents and predict occupancies the market is currently experiencing a consolidation of these software vendors particularly in the multifamily space which may negatively impact the company’s choice of vendor and pricing options moreover if any of these key vendors were to terminate our relationship or access to data or to fail we could suffer losses while we sought to replace the services and information provided by the vendors 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

capital and credit market conditions may affect the company’s access to sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could negatively affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to the company may be adversely affected our current balance sheet the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a diversified bank group access to the public and private placement debt markets and secured debt financing providers such as fannie mae and freddie mac provide some insulation from volatile capital markets we primarily use external financing including sales of debt and equity securities to fund acquisitions developments and redevelopments and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our acquisition development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or distributing less than 100 of our reit taxable income in general to the extent that the company’s access to capital and credit is at a higher cost than the company has experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing without a corresponding change to investment cap rates the company’s ability to make acquisitions develop or redevelop communities obtain new financing and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates could be adversely affected which would impact the companys financial standing and related credit rating in addition if our ability to obtain financing is adversely affected we may be unable to satisfy scheduled maturities on existing financing through other sources of our liquidity which in the case of secured financings could result in lender foreclosure on the apartment communities securing such debt 

debt financing has inherent risks at december 31 2020 the company had approximately 63 billion of indebtedness including 7751 million of variable rate indebtedness of which 1750 million is subject to an interest rate swap effectively fixing the interest rate on 1750 million in debt the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including among others the following 

• cash flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest 

• inability to refinance maturing indebtedness on encumbered apartment communities 

• inability to comply with debt covenants could trigger cash management provisions limiting our ability to control cash flows cause defaults or an acceleration of maturity dates and 

• paying debt before the scheduled maturity date could result in prepayment penalties 

the company may not be able to renew repay or refinance its indebtedness when due or may be required to refinance its indebtedness at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if the 

company is unable to refinance its indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all the company might be forced to dispose of one or more of its properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses such losses could have an adverse effect on the company and its ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders and pay amounts due on its debt 

debt financing of communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service debt and fund distributions where appropriate the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on the company’s investments and to provide for additional investments that the company could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the communities will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the reit distribution requirements of the code our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations working capital and capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms which in either case could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

as of december 31 2020 the company had 12 consolidated communities encumbered by debt with respect to such communities all of them are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those communities the holders of this indebtedness will have rights with respect to these communities and if debt payment obligations are not met lenders may seek foreclosure of communities or may appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies which would reduce the company’s income and net asset value and its ability to service other debt foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet reit distribution requirements 

compliance requirements of taxexempt financing and below market rent requirements may limit income from certain communities at december 31 2020 the company had approximately 2251 million of variable rate taxexempt financing this taxexempt financing provides for certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants the company expects to engage in taxexempt financings in the future if the compliance requirements of the taxexempt financing restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderate income tenants or eligiblequalified tenants then our income from these properties may be limited while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweigh any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed communities if the company is required to decrease its rental rates to attract tenants who satisfy the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for tenants satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and the company may be subject to additional contractual liability notwithstanding the limitations due to taxexempt financing requirements the income from certain communities may be limited due to below market rent requirements imposed by local authorities in connection with the original development of the community 

the indentures governing our notes and other financing arrangements contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility the indentures that govern our publicly registered notes contain financial and operating covenants that among other things restrict our ability to take specific actions even if we believe them to be in our best interests including restrictions on our ability to 

• consummate a merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and 

• incur additional secured and unsecured indebtedness 

the instruments governing our other unsecured indebtedness require us to meet specified financial covenants including covenants relating to net worth fixed charge coverage debt service coverage the amounts of total indebtedness and secured indebtedness leverage and certain investment limitations these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies our ability to comply with these provisions and those contained in the indentures governing the notes may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance changes in general business and economic conditions adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting us the breach of any of these covenants including those contained in our indentures could result in a default under our indebtedness which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable if any of our indebtedness is accelerated we may not be able to repay it 

uncertainty relating to the libor calculation process and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may materially adversely affect us the interest rate on certain of the company’s secured and unsecured debt obligations including the company’s two unsecured lines of credit is based on the libor in july 2017 the united kingdom regulator that regulates 

libor announced its intention to phase out libor rates by the end of 2021 on november 30 2020 the united kingdom regulator announced its intentions subject to confirmation following an early december consultation to cease the publication of the one week and two month us dollar libor immediately following the december 31 2021 publications and the remaining us dollar libor tenors immediately following the june 30 2023 publications at this time no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor and it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide libor submissions to the administrator of libor or whether any additional reforms to libor may be enacted in the united kingdom the united states or elsewhere any changes in the method used for determining libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in libor if a published us dollar libor rate is unavailable after 2021 the interest rates on certain of the company’s debt obligations could change uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes phase out alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the trading market for liborbased securities any of these proposals or consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs and as a result our financial condition and results of operations 

interest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses the company from time to time uses interest rate swaps and interest rate caps contracts to manage certain interest rate risks although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged the company may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the company to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk the company enters into hedging arrangements only with investment grade financial institutions 

a downgrade in the companys investment grade credit rating could materially and adversely affect its business and financial condition the company plans to manage its operations to maintain its investment grade credit rating with a capital structure consistent with its current profile but there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain its current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on the company’s cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on its financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

changes in the company’s financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness the company’s organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a limit on debt financing consistent with the existing covenants required to maintain the company’s unsecured line of credit bank facility unsecured debt and senior unsecured bonds although pursuant to this policy the company manages its debt to be in compliance with the debt covenants the company may increase the amount of outstanding debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in the company’s ability to service the additional debt accordingly the company could become more leveraged resulting in an increased risk of default on its debt covenants or on its debt obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements any covenant breach or significant increase in the company’s leverage could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

if the company or any of its subsidiaries defaults on an obligation to repay outstanding indebtedness when due the default could trigger a crossdefault or crossacceleration under other indebtedness if the company or any of its subsidiaries defaults on its obligations to repay outstanding indebtedness the default could cause a crossdefault or crossacceleration under other indebtedness a default under the agreements governing the company’s or its subsidiaries’ indebtedness including a default under mortgage indebtedness lines of credit bank term loan or the indenture for the company’s outstanding senior notes that is not waived by the required lenders or holders of outstanding notes could trigger crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions under one or more agreements governing the company’s indebtedness which could cause an immediate default or allow the lenders to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable 

the company could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac and by changes in government support for multifamily housing historically the company has utilized borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future the company primarily utilizes unsecured debt and repays secured debt at or near its respective maturity and places less reliance on agency mortgage debt financing potential options have been proposed for the future of agency mortgage finance in the united states that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing more generally it may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect the company and its growth and operations 

risks related to personnel 

the company depends on its key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed   the company’s success depends on its ability to attract train and retain executive officers senior officers and company managers there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the departure of any of the company’s key personnel could have an adverse effect on the company while the company engages in regular succession planning for key positions the company’s plans may be impacted and therefore adjusted due to the departure of any key personnel 

the company’s chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest the company’s chairman george m marcus is not an employee of the company and is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest mr marcus owns interests in various other real estaterelated businesses and investments he is the chairman of the marcus  millichap company mmc which is a parent company of a diversified group of real estate service investment and development firms mr marcus is also the cochairman of marcus  millichap inc mmi and mr marcus owns a controlling interest in mmi mmi is a national brokerage firm listed on the nyse that underwent its initial public offering in 2013 

mr marcus has agreed not to divulge any confidential or proprietary information that may be received by him in his capacity as chairman of the company to any of his affiliated companies and that he will absent himself from any and all discussions by essexs board of directors regarding any proposed acquisition andor development of an apartment community where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of his affiliated companies notwithstanding this agreement mr marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with the company in acquiring andor developing apartment communities which competition may be detrimental to the company in addition due to such potential competition for real estate investments mr marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with the company which may be detrimental to the interests of essexs stockholders and the operating partnerships unitholders 

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock as of december 31 2020 mr marcus wholly or partially owned approximately 19 million shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships indirectly held shares of common stock and assuming exercise of all vested options mr marcus currently does not have majority control over the company however he currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all the company’s stockholders 

under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for certain amendments of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with the company the company’s directors and executive officers including mr marcus have substantial influence on the company consequently their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders 

our related party guidelines may not adequately address all of the issues that may arise with respect to related party transactions the company has adopted related party transaction approval process guidelines that provide generally that any transaction in which a director or executive officer has an interest must have the prior approval of the audit committee of essexs board of directors the review and approval procedures in these guidelines are intended to determine whether a particular related party transaction is fair reasonable and serves the interests of the companys stockholders pursuant to these guidelines related party transactions have been approved from time to time there is no assurance that this policy will be adequate for determining whether a particular related party transaction is suitable and fair for the company also the policys procedures may not identify and address all the potential issues and conflicts of interests with a related party transaction 

employee theft or fraud could result in loss certain of our employees have access to or signature authority with respect to bank accounts or other company assets which exposes us to the risk of fraud or theft in addition certain employees have access to key information technology it infrastructure and to tenant and other information that is commercially valuable should any employee compromise our it systems or misappropriate tenant or other information we could incur losses including significant financial or reputational harm from which full recovery cannot be assured we also may not have insurance that covers any losses in full or that covers losses from particular criminal acts potential liabilities for theft or fraud are not quantifiable and an estimate of possible loss cannot be made 

risks related to taxes and status as a reit 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs and impacts of economic conditions could limit cash flow available for dividend distributions as well as the form and timing of such distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders a decrease in rental revenue or liquidity needs such as the repayment of indebtedness or 

funding of our acquisition and development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

essex may choose to pay dividends in its own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in essexs stock taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of essexs stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of essexs stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

the maryland business combination act may delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control of the company that might involve a premium price for the companys stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders under the maryland general corporation law certain business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these business combinations include a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities an interested stockholder is defined as any person and certain affiliates of such person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock of the corporation the law also requires a two supermajority stockholder votes for such transactions this means that the transaction must be approved by at least

the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under the maryland general corporation law as permitted by the statute the board of directors of essex irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination among the company george m marcus who is the chairman of the company and mmc or any entity owned or controlled by mr marcus and mmc consequently the fiveyear prohibition and supermajority vote requirements described above will not apply to any business combination between the company mr marcus or mmc as a result the company may in the future enter into business combinations with mr marcus and mmc without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland business combination act 

certain provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement charter and bylaws and certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law could delay defer or prevent a change in control while the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on the company’s power to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company’s stock or otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect their interests the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership the company may not without first obtaining the consent of a majority in interest of the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of the company’s general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity such limitations on the company’s power to act may result in the company’s being precluded from taking action that the board of directors otherwise believes is in the best interests of the company or its stockholders 

the company’s charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other terms of such stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock the company may establish one or more classes or series of stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control such a 

transaction might involve a premium price for the company’s stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock also such a class or series of stock could have dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interests of holders of common stock 

the company’s charter contains provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

the maryland general corporation law restricts the voting rights of holders of shares deemed to be control shares under the maryland general corporation law control shares are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the company’s stockholders 

the company’s charter and bylaws as well as maryland general corporation law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of essex’s board of directors and that in turn may delay defer or prevent a transaction including a change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the companys stockholders those provisions include among others 

• directors may be removed by stockholders without cause only upon the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of the directors and with cause only upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of the directors 

• essex’s board of directors can fix the number of directors and fill vacant directorships upon the vote of a majority of the directors and essexs board of directors can classify the board such that the entire board is not up for reelection annually 

• stockholders must give advance notice to nominate directors or propose business for consideration at a stockholders’ meeting and 

• for stockholders to call a special meeting the meeting must be requested by not less than a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting 

loss of the companys reit status would have significant adverse consequences to the company and the value of the companys common stock  the company has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code the company’s qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy various annual and quarterly requirements including income asset and distribution tests established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 

for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enable it to qualify as a reit it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year the company would be subject to us federal corporate income tax on the company’s taxable income and the company could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for taxable years prior to 2018 and the company would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income the company would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to essex stockholders and operating partnership unitholders and the company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders for the purpose of maintaining reit status as a result of all these factors the company’s failure to qualify as a reit also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value and market price of the company’s common stock 

complying with reit requirements may affect our profitability and may force us to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments to qualify as a reit we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the nature and diversification of our assets the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders we may be required to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments in order to satisfy the asset and income tests or to qualify under certain 

statutory relief provisions we also may be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution as a result having to comply with the distribution requirement could cause us to 1 sell assets in adverse market conditions 2 borrow on unfavorable terms or 3 distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt accordingly satisfying the reit requirements could materially and adversely affect us moreover if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to meet any of these asset income or distribution tests or to repay obligations to our lenders we may be unable to comply with one or more of the requirements applicable to reits or may be subject to a 100 tax on any resulting of debt accordingly satisfying the reit requirements could materially and adversely affect us moreover if we are compelled to liquidate our investments to meet any of these asset income or distribution tests or to repay obligations to our lenders we may be unable to comply with one or more of the requirements applicable to reits or may be subject to a 100 tax on any resulting gain if such sales constitute prohibited transactions 

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on the company or its stockholders the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive legislation could adversely affect the company or its stockholders new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in the company also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

the company’s ownership of trss is subject to certain restrictions and it will be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on certain income or deductions if transactions with the company’s trss are not conducted on arm’s length terms the company has established several trss the trss must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income as a regular c corporation while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its trss do not adversely affect its reit qualification it cannot provide assurances that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore the company may be subject to a 100 penalty tax to the extent dealings between the company and its trss are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature the company intends that its dealings with its trss will be on an arm’s length basis no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not assert a contrary position 

failure of one or more of the company’s subsidiaries to qualify as a reit could adversely affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit the company owns interests in multiple subsidiary reits that have elected to be taxed as reits under the code these subsidiary reits are subject to the various reit qualification requirements and other limitations that are applicable to the company if any of the company’s subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit then i the subsidiary reit would become subject to federal income tax and ii the company’s ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit would cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits if any of the company’s subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as reits it is possible that the company could also fail to qualify as a reit 

the tax imposed on reits engaging in prohibited transactions may limit the company’s ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes from time to time the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties under the code unless certain exceptions apply any gain resulting from transfers of properties that the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business could be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since the company acquires properties for investment purposes it does not believe that its occasional transfers or disposals of property should be treated as prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by the company are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then the company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to it from the prohibited transaction and the company’s ability to retain proceeds from real property sales may be jeopardized 

dividends payable by reits may be taxed at higher rates than dividends of nonreit corporations which could reduce the net cash received by stockholders and may be detrimental to the company’s ability to raise additional funds through any future sale of its stock dividends paid by reits to us stockholders that are individuals trusts or estates are generally not eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividends received from nonreit corporations us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates generally may deduct 20 of ordinary dividends from a reit for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends this 

may cause investors to view reit investments as less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock in reits including the companys stock 

we may face risks in connection with section 1031 exchanges from time to time we dispose of real properties in transactions intended to qualify as likekind exchanges under section 1031 of the code if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable we may face adverse consequences and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed we may not be able to dispose of real properties on a tax deferred basis 

if the operating partnership failed to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes the company could cease to qualify as a reit and suffer other adverse consequences the company believes that the operating partnership will continue to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership is not subject to us federal income tax on its income instead each of its partners is required to pay tax on the partner’s allocable share of the income of the operating partnership no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not challenge the operating partnership’s status as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the internal revenue service were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes the company could fail to meet the income tests andor the asset tests applicable to reits and accordingly cease to qualify as a reit also the failure of the operating partnership to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and distribution to its partners including us 

partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us under current federal partnership tax audit rules subject to certain exceptions any audit adjustment to items of income gain loss deduction or credit of a partnership and a partner’s allocable share thereof is determined and taxes interest and penalties attributable thereto are assessed and collected at the partnership level unless the partnership makes an election or takes certain steps to require the partners to pay their tax on their allocable shares of the adjustment it is possible that partnerships in which we directly or indirectly invest would be required to pay additional taxes interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment we as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes interest and penalties even though essex as a reit may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate‑level taxes had we owned the assets of the partnership directly the partnership tax audit rules apply to essex portfolio lp and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on us 

general risks 

we may from time to time be subject to litigation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we may be a party to various claims and routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business some of these claims may result in defense costs settlements fines or judgments against us some of which are not or cannot be covered by insurance payment of any such costs settlements fines or judgments that are not insured could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured or adversely impact our ability to attract officers and directors 

rising interest rates may affect the company’s costs of capital and financing activities and results of operation and otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock interest rates could increase which could result in higher interest expense on the company’s variable rate indebtedness or increase interest rates when refinancing maturing fixed rate debt prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company’s ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with positive economic returns on investment and the company’s ability to refinance existing borrowings in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances including significant cash amounts at our wholly owned insurance subsidiary pwi as well as 401k plan assets in a limited number of financial institutions our cash balances are generally in excess of federally insured limits the failure or collapse of one or more of these financial institutions may materially adversely affect our ability to recover our cash balances or the 401k assets certain financial institutions are lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations additionally certain of our taxexempt bond 

financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds 

the price per share of the company’s stock may fluctuate significantly the market price per share of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including without limitation 

• regional national and global economic conditions 

• actual or anticipated variations in the company’s quarterly operating results or dividends 

• changes in the company’s funds from operations or earnings estimates 

• issuances of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities or the perception that such issuances might occur 

• publication of research reports about the company or the real estate industry 

• the general reputation of reits and the attractiveness of their equity securities in comparison to other equity securities including securities issued by other real estate based companies 

• general stock and bond market conditions including changes in interest rates on fixed income securities that may lead prospective purchasers of the company’s stock to demand a higher annual yield from dividends 

• shifts in our investor base to a higher concentration of passive investors such as exchange traded fund and index funds which may adversely affect our ability to communicate effectively with our investors 

• the resale of substantial amounts of the companys stock or the anticipation of such resale by large holders of our securities 

• availability of capital markets and cost of capital 

• a change in analyst ratings or the company’s credit ratings 

• terrorist activity adversely affecting the markets in which the company’s securities trade possibly increasing market volatility and causing erosion of business and consumer confidence and spending 

• hazards such as natural disasters like earthquakes wildfires landslides or flooding terrorism an active shooter at a property or corporate office an incident involving multiple key members of the executive team or an epidemic or pandemic 

• changes in public policy and tax law and 

• the issuance of ratings and scores related to corporate social responsibility csr and environmental social and governance esg reports and disclosures 

many of the factors listed above are beyond the company’s control these factors may cause the market price of shares of the company’s common stock to decline regardless of the company’s financial condition results of operations or business prospects 

the company’s future issuances of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities could be dilutive to current stockholders and adversely affect the market price of the company’s common stock in order to finance the company’s acquisition and development activities the company could issue and sell common stock preferred stock and convertible debt securities the company may in the future sell further shares of common stock including pursuant to its equity distribution program with citigroup global markets inc barclays capital inc bnp paribas securities corp btig llc capital one securities inc jefferies llc jp morgan securities llc mizuho securities usa llc mufg securities americas inc and scotia capital usa inc 

in 2018 the company filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec allowing the company to sell an undetermined number of equity and debt securities as defined in the prospectus future sales of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 

stockholders have limited control over changes in our policies and operations essex’s board of directors determines our major policies including our policies regarding investments financing growth debt capitalization reit qualification and distributions essex’s board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies without a vote of the stockholders in addition pursuant to maryland law all matters other than the election or removal of a director must be declared advisable by essex’s board of directors prior to a stockholder vote 

our score or rating by proxy advisory firms or other corporate governance consultants advising institutional investors could have an adverse effect on the perception of our corporate governance and thereby negatively impact the market price of our common stock various proxy advisory firms and other corporate governance consultants advising institutional investors 

provide scores or ratings of our governance measures nominees for election as directors executive compensation practices esg or sustainability matters and other matters that may be submitted to stockholders for consideration at our annual meetings from time to time certain matters that we propose for approval may not receive a favorable score or rating or may result in a negative score or rating or recommendation against the nominee or matter proposed these unfavorable scores or ratings may lead to rejected proposals or a loss of stockholder confidence in our corporate governance measures which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we periodically review our corporate governance measures including our esg business practices and consider implementing changes that we believe are responsive to concerns that have been raised but there may be times where we decide not to implement changes or other measures recommended by proxy advisors or other corporate governance consultants that we believe are contrary to the best interests of our stockholders notwithstanding the adverse effect this decision may have on our scores or ratings or the perception of our corporate governance thereby negatively impacting the market price of our common stock 

corporate responsibility specifically related to esg factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks the company and many of its investors and potential investors are focused on corporate responsibility specifically related to esg factors some investors may use esg factors to guide their investment strategies many investment funds focus on positive esg business practices and sustainability scores when making investments and may consider a company’s sustainability efforts andor score when making an investment decision in addition investors particularly institutional investors may use esg or sustainability scores to benchmark companies against their peers although the company makes esg disclosures and undertakes sustainability and diversity initiatives there can be no assurance that the company will score highly on esg matters in the future in addition the criteria by which companies are rated may change which could cause the company to perform differently or worse than it has in the past the company may face reputational damage in the event its corporate responsibility procedures or standards do not meet the standards set by various constituencies the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the price of the company’s stock and the company’s business financial condition and results of operations including increased development costs capital expenditures and operating expenses 

we could face adverse consequences as a result of actions of activist investors campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company responding to stockholder activism or engaging in a process or proxy contest may be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our management team and our employees from executing our business plan which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

expanding social media vehicles present new risks  the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or information leakage negative posts or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our reputation in addition employees or others might disclose nonpublic sensitive information relating to our business through external media channels the continuing evolution of social media will present us with new challenges and risks 

any material weaknesses identified in the companys internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on the company’s stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires the company to evaluate and report on its internal control over financial reporting if the company identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting the company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on the company’s stock price

 item 2 properties 

the company’s portfolio as of december 31 2020 including communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures but excluding communities underlying preferred equity investments was comprised of 246 stabilized operating apartment communities comprising 60272 apartment homes of which 26581 apartment homes are located in southern california 21584 apartment homes are located in northern california and 12107 apartment homes are located in the seattle metropolitan area the company’s apartment communities accounted for 994 of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 

occupancy rates 

financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental income by total potential rental income total potential rental income represents the value of all apartment homes with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents when calculating actual rents for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes delinquencies and concessions are not taken into account the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates and the companys calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy as disclosed by other reits market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes the company may increase or decrease these rates based on a variety of factors including overall supply and demand for housing concentration of new apartment deliveries within the same submarket which can cause periodic disruption due to greater rental concessions to increase leasing velocity and rental affordability 

for communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while a community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual income is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy 

communities

current material development – the covid19 pandemic 

the united states and other countries around the world are continuing to experience an unprecedented health pandemic related to covid19 which has created considerable instability disruption and uncertainty governmental authorities in impacted regions are taking dramatic and unpredictable actions in an effort to slow covid19’s spread federal state and local jurisdictions have issued and revised varying forms of shelterinplace orders halted or restricted public gatherings and restricted business to only those that are considered essential or requiring businesses to make changes to their operations in a manner that negatively affects profitability resulting in extraordinary job losses and related financial impacts that will affect future operations to an unknown extent moreover eviction moratoriums and laws that limit rent increases during times of emergency and prohibit the ability to collect unpaid rent during certain timeframes have been enacted in various formats at various levels of government including regions in which essexs communities are located impacting essex properties the company is working to comply with the stated intent of local county state and federal laws in that regard the company has implemented a wide range of practices to protect and support its employees and residents such measures include 

• closing the companys corporate offices and instituting “work from home” measures for corporate associates 

• closing leasing offices to nonessex personnel reducing onsite staff so that hygiene and “social distancing” standards can be effectively managed and applied and requiring face coverings to be worn 

• transitioning most public interactions with leasing staff to online and telephonic communications 

• increasing cleaning practices for common areas and community amenities and temporarily closing common areas and community amenities or opening with limited hours limited capacity or by reservation only depending in part on jurisdictional requirements and 

• delaying the response to maintenance orders in certain circumstances in order to promote the protection of the companys employees and residents 

due to the covid19 pandemic some of the companys residents their health their employment and thus their ability to pay rent have been and may continue to be impacted to support residents the company has implemented the following steps including but not limited to 

• assembling a resident response team to effectively and efficiently respond to resident needs and concerns with respect to the pandemic 

• structuring payment plans for residents who are unable to pay their rent as a result of the outbreak and waiving late fees for those residents and 

• establishing the essex cares fund for the purpose of supporting the company’s residents and communities that are experiencing financial hardships caused by the covid19 pandemic 

the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the us and world economies generally and on the companys results in particular has been and may continue to be significant the longterm impact will largely depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to when a vaccine can be safely and widely distributed and whether employees and employers will continue to promote remote work if and when the pandemic concludes this includes new information which may emerge concerning the severity of covid19 the success of actions taken to contain or treat 

covid19 future laws that may be enacted the impact on job growth and the broader economy and reactions by consumers companies governmental entities and capital markets 

primarily as a result of the impact of the covid19 pandemic the companys cash delinquencies as a percentage of scheduled rental income for the company’s stabilized apartment communities or sameproperty stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 increased from 03 for 2019 to 25 for 2020 the company has executed some payment plans and will continue to work with residents to execute payment plans related to such cash delinquencies as part of this process the company assessed the collectability reserve attributable to those deferred payments and the anticipated execution of payment plans in the future which partially mitigated the delinquencies resulting in actual delinquencies as a percentage of scheduled rent for the companys sameproperty portfolio of 21 for the year ended december 31 2020 as of december 31 2020 the increase in delinquencies has not had a material adverse impact to the companys liquidity position 

the covid19 pandemic has not negatively impacted the companys ability to access traditional funding sources on the same or reasonably similar terms as were available in recent periods prior to the pandemic as demonstrated by the companys financing activity during the year ended december 31 2020 discussed in the “liquidity and capital resources section below the company is not at material risk of not meeting the covenants in its credit agreements and is able to timely service its debt and other obligations  

results of operations 

comparison of year ended december 31 2020 to the year ended december 31 2019 

the company’s average financial occupancy for the company’s stabilized apartment communities or 2020 sameproperty stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 decreased 60 basis points to 960 in 2020 from 966 in 2019 financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental income by total scheduled rental income actual rental income represents contractual rental income pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total scheduled rental income represents the value of all apartment homes with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant apartment home at its estimated market rate 

market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes the company may increase or decrease these rates based on a variety of factors including overall supply and demand for housing concentration of new apartment deliveries within the same submarket which can cause periodic disruption due to greater rental concessions to increase leasing velocity and rental affordability financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates and the companys calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy disclosed by other reits 

the company does not take into account delinquency and concessions to calculate actual rent for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes the calculation of financial occupancy compares contractual rates for occupied apartment homes to estimated market rents for unoccupied apartment homes and thus the calculation compares the gross value of all apartment homes excluding delinquency and concessions for apartment communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while an apartment community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual income is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy 

the regional breakdown of the company’s 2020 sameproperty portfolio for financial occupancy for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 is as follows 



the following table provides a breakdown of revenue amounts including the revenues attributable to 2020 sameproperties

2020 nonsame property revenues increased by 875 million or 782 to 1995 million in 2020 compared to 1119 million in 2019 the increase was primarily due to revenues generated from the six communities that were consolidated as part of the companys purchase of cppibs 450 coinvestment interests in the first quarter of 2020 offset by the sale of one south market delano and 416 on broadway during 2020

gain on sale of real estate and land of 650 million in 2020 was primarily attributable to the portfolio sale of one south market and museum park in the second quarter of 2020 the sale of delano in the third quarter of 2020 and the sale of 416 on broadway in the fourth quarter of 2020 the companys 32 million loss on sale of real estate and land in 2019 was attributable to the sale of land in san mateo ca that had been held for future development 

interest expense increased by 33 million or 15 to 2206 million in 2020 compared to 2173 million in 2019  primarily due to an increase in average outstanding debt primarily as a result of the issuance of 5000 million of senior unsecured notes due march 1 2029 in february and march 2019 5500 million of senior unsecured notes due january 15 2030 in august and october 2019 650 million of senior unsecured notes due march 15 2032 in february and june 2020 and 600 million of senior unsecured notes due january 15 2031 and september 1 2050 in august 2020 which resulted in an increase of 376 million interest expense for 2020 as compared to 2019 additionally there was a 96 million decrease in capitalized interest in 2020 due to a decrease in development activity as compared to the same period in 2019 these increases to interest expense were partially offset by debt that was paid off matured or regular principal amortization during and after 2019 and lower average interest rates which resulted in a decrease in interest expense of 439 million for 2020 

total return swap income of 107 million in 2020 consists of monthly settlements related to the companys four total return swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 2548 million

liquidity and capital resources 

the united states and other countries around the world are experiencing an unprecedented health pandemic related to covid19 which has created considerable instability and disruption in the us and world economies governmental authorities in affected regions are taking extraordinary steps in an effort to slow down the spread of the virus and mitigate its impact on affected populations 

the following table sets forth the company’s cash flows for 2020 2019 and 2018  in thousands 



essex’s business is operated primarily through the operating partnership essex issues public equity from time to time but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself other than incurring certain expenses from operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the operating partnership essex itself does not hold any indebtedness and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the operating partnership essex’s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock and preferred stock essex’s sole source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the operating partnership 

as of december 31 2020 essex owned a 966 general partner interest and the limited partners owned the remaining 34 interest in the operating partnership 

the liquidity of essex is dependent on the operating partnership’s ability to make sufficient distributions to essex the primary cash requirement of essex is its payment of dividends to its stockholders essex also guarantees some of the operating partnership’s debt as discussed further in notes 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k if the operating partnership fails to fulfill certain of its debt requirements which trigger essex’s guarantee obligations then essex will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees however essex’s only significant asset is its investment in the operating partnership 

for essex to maintain its qualification as a reit it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding net capital gains while historically essex has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of other property including in limited circumstances essex’s own stock as a result of this distribution requirement the operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not reits can essex may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating partnership’s working capital needs acquisitions and developments 

at december 31 2020 the company had 736 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and 1478 million in marketable securities the company believes that cash flows generated by its operations existing cash and cash equivalents marketable securities balances and availability under existing lines of credit are sufficient to meet all of its anticipated cash needs during 2021 additionally the capital markets continue to be available and the company is able to generate cash from the disposition of real estate assets to finance additional cash flow needs including continued development and select acquisitions in the event that conditions become further exacerbated due to the covid19 pandemic and related economic disruptions the company may further utilize other resources such as its cash reserves lines of credit or decreased investment in redevelopment activities to supplement operating cash flows the company is carefully monitoring and managing its cash position in light of ongoing conditions and levels of operations the timing source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment which can affect the company’s plans for acquisitions dispositions development and redevelopment activities

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities the company defines critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require the companys management to exercise their most difficult subjective and complex judgments the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates relate principally to the following key areas i accounting for the acquisition of investments in real estate specifically the allocation between land and buildings and ii evaluation of events and changes in circumstances indicating whether the company’s rental properties may be impaired the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 

the company accounts for its acquisitions of investments in real estate by assessing each acquisition to determine if it meets the definition of a business or if it qualifies as an asset acquisition we expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions and result in the capitalization of acquisition costs and the allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair value of the respective assets and liabilities 

in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price the company utilizes a number of sources including independent land appraisals which consider comparable market transactions its own analysis of recently acquired or developed comparable properties in our portfolio for land comparables and building replacement costs and other publicly available market data in calculating the fair value of identified intangible assets of an acquired property the inplace leases are valued based on inplace rent rates and amortized over the average remaining term of all acquired leases 

the company periodically assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments for indicators of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties including the net operating income for the most recent 12 month period monitoring estimated costs for properties under development the companys ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset and each propertys remaining useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property 

when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 

the company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 

funds from operations 

funds from operations ffo is a financial measure that is commonly used in the reit industry the company presents ffo and ffo excluding noncore items referred to as core ffo as supplemental operating performance measures ffo and core ffo are not used by the company as nor should they be considered to be alternatives to net income computed under us gaap as an indicator of the company’s operating performance or as alternatives to cash from operating activities computed under us gaap as an indicator of the companys ability to fund its cash needs 

ffo and core ffo are not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and do not present nor do they intend to present a complete picture of the companys financial condition and operating performance the company believes that net income computed under us gaap is the primary measure of performance and that ffo and core ffo are only meaningful when they are used in conjunction with net income the company considers ffo and core ffo to be useful financial performance measurements of an equity reit because together with net income and cash flows ffo and core ffo provide investors with additional bases to evaluate operating performance and ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures and to pay dividends by excluding gains or losses related to sales of 

depreciated operating properties and excluding real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates ffo can help investors compare the operating performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies by further adjusting for items that are not considered part of the company’s core business operations core ffo allows investors to compare the core operating performance of the company to its performance in prior reporting periods and to the operating performance of other real estate companies without the effect of items that by their nature are not comparable from period to period and tend to obscure the company’s actual operating results the company believes that its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 

  

in calculating ffo the company follows the definition for this measure published by nareit which is the leading reit industry association the company believes that under the nareit ffo definition the two most significant adjustments made to net income are i the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and ii the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of previously depreciated properties the company agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

  

a historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with us gaap assumes through depreciation charges that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time nareit stated in its white paper on funds from operations “since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves consequently nareit’s definition of ffo reflects the fact that real estate as an asset class generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by us gaap do not reflect the underlying economic realities 

b reits were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of longterm ownership and management of real estate the exclusion in nareit’s definition of ffo of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the longterm assets that form the core of a reit’s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 

management believes that it has consistently applied the nareit definition of ffo to all periods presented however there is judgment involved and other reits calculation of ffo may vary from the nareit definition for this measure and thus their disclosure of ffo may not be comparable to the company’s calculation 

the table below is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to ffo and core ffo for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



1 represents deferred tax income expense recorded during the year related to net unrealized gains on the real estate technology ventures lp coinvestment 

2 represents the companys share of coinvestment income from real estate technology ventures lp 

3 on january 1 2019 the company adopted asu no 201712 derivatives and hedging  targeted improvements to accounting for hedging activities which resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately 181000 from interest expense to accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the adoption of this standard the company 

recognizes qualifying hedge ineffectiveness through accumulated other comprehensive income as opposed to current earnings 

4 assumes conversion of all outstanding op units into shares of the companys common stock and excludes all downreit units for which the operating partnership has the ability and intention to redeem the units for cash and does not consider them to be common stock equivalents 

net operating income 

net operating income noi and sameproperty noi are considered by management to be important supplemental performance measures to earnings from operations included in the company’s consolidated statements of income the presentation of sameproperty noi assists with the presentation of the company’s operations prior to the allocation of depreciation and any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual communities or groups of communities in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets the company defines sameproperty noi as sameproperty revenues less sameproperty operating expenses including property taxes please see the reconciliation of earnings from operations to noi and sameproperty noi which in the table below is the noi for stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the periods presented  in thousands

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

interest rate hedging activities 

the company’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks to accomplish this objective the company uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy as of december 31 2020 the company had entered into five interest rate swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in the interestrelated cash outflows on 1750 million of the unsecured term debt as of december 31 2020 the company also had 2251 million of secured variable rate indebtedness all of the company’s interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges as of december 31 2020 the following table summarizes the notional amount carrying value and estimated fair value of the company’s cash flow hedge derivative instruments used to hedge interest rates as of december 31 2020 the notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a particular security that is currently hedged at one time but does not represent exposure to credit interest rates or market risks the table also includes a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the impact on the company’s derivative instruments from an increase or decrease in 10year treasury bill interest rates by 50 basis points as of december 31 2020 



additionally the company has entered into total return swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 2548 million that effectively convert 2251 million of fixed mortgage notes payable and 297 million of mortgage notes payable related to real estate held for sale that is included in liabilities associated with real estate held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet to a floating interest rate based on the sifma plus a spread and have a carrying value of zero at december 31 2020 the company is exposed to insignificant interest rate risk on these swaps as the related mortgages are callable at par by the company coterminus with the termination of any related swap these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting 

interest rate sensitive liabilities 

the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its lines of credit and longterm debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company’s real estate investment portfolio and operations the company’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 

the company’s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows management has estimated the fair value of the company’s 55 billion of fixed rate debt at december 31 2020 to be 60 billion management has estimated the fair value of the company’s 7751 million of variable rate debt at december 31 2020 to be 7701 million based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable and variable rate demand notes compared to those available in the marketplace the following table represents scheduled principal payments  in thousands 

  



  

1 1750 million is subject to interest rate protection agreements 1750 million is subject to interest rate swaps 2251 million of variable rate debt in the table above excludes 297 million of variable rate debt related to real estate held for sale that is included in liabilities associated with real estate held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet and both amounts are subject to total return swaps 

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2020 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result the company’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations and hedging strategies would depend on the exposures that arise prior to settlement

 item 1a risk factors 

for purposes of this section the term stockholders means the holders of shares of essex property trust inc’s common stock set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to essex property trust inc’s stockholders and essex portfolio lp’s unitholders you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our company our properties and our business 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual operating results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

risks related to our real estate investments and operations 

general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks if the communities and other real estate investments do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and the ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders will be adversely affected income from the communities may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

 

as leases at the communities expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to the company income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws including without limitation the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the disabilities act fair housing amendment act of 1988 the fhaa permanent and temporary rent control laws rent stabilization laws other laws regulating housing that may prevent the company from raising rents to offset increased operating expenses and tax laws 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents and the company may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less if the company is unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then the company’s results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected with these short term leases our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

national and regional economic environments can negatively impact the company’s liquidity and operating results the companys forecast for the national economy assumes growth of the gross domestic product of the national economy and the economies of the west coast states in the event of a recession the company could incur reductions in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising and turnover expenses a recession may affect consumer confidence and spending and negatively impact the volume and pricing of real estate transactions which could negatively affect the company’s liquidity and its ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes to the economy furthermore if residents do not experience increases in their income they may be unable or unwilling to pay rent increases and delinquencies in rent payments and rent defaults may increase 

rent control or other changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect the companys operations or expose us to liability the company must own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop its properties in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes rent control or stabilization laws federal state and local tax laws landlord tenant laws environmental laws employment laws immigration laws and other laws regulating housing or that are generally applicable to the companys business and operations noncompliance with laws could expose the company to liability if the company does not comply with any or all of these requirements it may have to pay fines to government authorities or damage awards to private litigants andor may have to decrease rents in order to comply with such requirements the company does not know whether these requirements will change or whether new requirements will be imposed changes in or noncompliance with these regulatory requirements could require the company to make significant unanticipated expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition rent control or rent stabilization laws and other regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to increase rents and pass through new or increased operating costs to our tenants there has been a recent increase in municipalities including those in which we own properties considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions which could limit our ability to raise rents based solely on market conditions these initiatives and any other future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing as well as any lawsuits against the company arising from such rent control or other laws may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs such laws and regulations limit our ability to charge market rents increase rents evict tenants or recover increases in our operating expenses and could reduce the value of our communities or make it more difficult for us to dispose of properties in certain circumstances expenses associated with our investment in these communities such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from the community furthermore such regulations may negatively impact our ability to attract higherpaying tenants to such communities 

acquisitions of communities involve various risks and uncertainties and may fail to meet expectations the company intends to continue to acquire apartment communities however there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet the company’s expectations the company’s estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow the company to market an acquired apartment community as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate in addition following an acquisition the value and operational performance of an apartment community may be diminished if obsolescence or neighborhood changes occur before we are able to redevelop or sell the community also in connection with such acquisitions we may assume unknown liabilities which could ultimately lead to material costs for us that we did not expect to incur the company expects to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or joint ventures or additional equity by the company the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the company’s existing stockholders if the company finances new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless the company obtains substitute financing the company may not be able to undertake additional borrowing for further acquisitions or developments or such borrowing may be not available on advantageous terms 

development and redevelopment activities may be delayed not completed andor not achieve expected results the company pursues development and redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals which have no assurance of being received andor the timing of which may be delayed from the company’s expectations the company defines development projects as new communities that are being constructed or are newly constructed and are in a phase of leaseup and have not yet reached stabilized operations and redevelopment projects as existing properties owned or recently acquired that have been targeted for additional investment by the company with the expectation of increased financial returns through property improvement as of december 31 2019 the company had five consolidated development projects and two unconsolidated joint venture development projects comprised of 1960 apartment homes for an estimated cost of 13 billion of which 2220 million remains to be expended and 1930 million is the companys share in addition at december 31 2019 the company had ownership interests in four major redevelopment projects aggregating 1327 apartment homes with estimated redevelopment costs of 1327 million of which approximately 149 million remains to be expended 

the company’s development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including among others 



 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to essex’s stockholders and the operating partnerships unitholders further the development and redevelopment of communities is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see the risk factor above titled  general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values 

our apartment communities may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities which could cause us to incur substantial costs the properties that the company owns or may acquire are or may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which the company may have no recourse or only limited recourse against the sellers in general the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements related to the sales of the properties may not survive the closing of the transactions while the company will seek to require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive such indemnification may be limited and subject to various materiality thresholds a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses as a result there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties in addition the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with apartment communities may exceed our expectations and we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the geographic concentration of the company’s communities and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and operating results the company generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2019  from the company’s communities concentrated in southern california primarily los angeles orange santa barbara san diego and ventura counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area for the year ended december 31 2019  82 of the company’s rental revenues were generated from communities located in california this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations in general factors that may adversely affect local market and economic conditions include among others the following 

 

because the company’s communities are primarily located in southern california northern california and the seattle metropolitan area the company is exposed to greater economic concentration risks than if it owned a more geographically diverse portfolio the company is susceptible to adverse developments in california and washington economic and regulatory environments such as increases in real estate and other taxes and increased costs of complying with governmental regulations in addition the state of california is generally regarded as more litigious and more highly regulated and taxed than many states which may reduce demand for the company’s communities any adverse developments in the economy or real estate markets in california or washington or any decrease in demand for the company’s communities resulting from the california 

or washington regulatory or business environments could have an adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company may experience various increased costs including increased property taxes to own and maintain its properties real property taxes on our properties may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change our real estate taxes in washington could increase as a result of property value reassessments or increased property tax rates in that state a current california law commonly referred to as proposition 13 generally limits annual real estate tax increases on california properties to 2 of assessed value however under proposition 13 property tax reassessment generally occurs as a result of a change in ownership of a property as specially defined for purposes of those rules because the property taxing authorities may not determine whether there has been a change in ownership or the actual reassessed value of a property for a period of time after a transaction has occurred we may not know the impact of a potential reassessment for a considerable amount of time following a particular transaction therefore the amount of property taxes we are required to pay could increase substantially from the property taxes we currently pay or have paid in the past including on a retroactive basis in addition from time to time voters and lawmakers have announced initiatives to repeal or amend proposition 13 to eliminate its application to commercial and industrial property andor introduce split tax roll legislation such initiatives if successful could increase the assessed value andor tax rates applicable to commercial property in california including our apartment communities further changes in us federal tax law including us tax legislation enacted in december 2017 the 2017 tax legislation could cause state and local governments to alter their taxation of real property 

the company may experience increased costs associated with capital improvements and routine property maintenance such as repairs to the foundation exterior walls and rooftops of its properties as its properties advance through their lifecycles in some cases we may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or maintenance increases in the company’s expenses to own and maintain its properties could adversely impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

competition in the apartment community market and other housing alternatives may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for the company’s communities there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting tenants these include other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent or for sale in the markets in which our communities are located competitive housing in a particular area and fluctuations in cost of owneroccupied single and multifamily homes caused by a decrease in housing prices mortgage interest rates andor government programs to promote home ownership or create additional rental andor other types of housing could adversely affect the company’s ability to retain its tenants lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents if the demand for the company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing apartment communities rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations the company also faces competition from other companies reits businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities this competition may result in an increase in prices and costs of apartment communities that the company acquires andor develops 

investments in mortgages mezzanine loans subordinated debt other real estate and other marketable securities could adversely affect the company’s cash flow from operations the company may purchase or otherwise invest in securities issued by entities which own real estate andor invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations such mortgages may be first second or third mortgages and these mortgages andor other investments may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed the company may make or acquire mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity or entities that owns the interest in the entity owning the property in general investments in mortgages include the following risks 

 

if any of the above were to occur it could adversely affect the company’s cash flows from operations 

the company’s ownership of coinvestments including joint ventures and joint ownership of communities its ownership of properties with shared facilities with a homeowners association or other entity its ownership of properties subject to a 

ground lease and its preferred equity investments and its other partial interests in entities that own communities could limit the company’s ability to control such communities and may restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in these properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated 

the company has entered into and may continue in the future to enter into certain coinvestments including joint ventures or partnerships through which it owns an indirect economic interest in less than 100 of the community or land or other investments owned directly by the joint venture or partnership as of december 31 2019  the company had through several joint ventures an interest in 10672 apartment homes in stabilized operating communities for a total book value of 7435 million 

joint venture partners often have shared control over the development and operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company’s business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to the company’s instructions or requests or its policies or objectives consequently a joint venture partners actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives the company may be unable to take action without its joint venture partners’ approval a joint venture partner might fail to approve decisions that are in the company’s best interests should a joint venture partner become bankrupt the company could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities in some instances the company and the joint venture partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause the company to sell its interest or acquire a partner’s interest at a time when the company otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction 

from time to time the company through the operating partnership invests in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing financing or managing real property the company makes certain coinvestments in the form of preferred equity investments in third party entities that own real estate with preferred equity investments and certain other coinvestments the operating partnership’s interest in a particular entity is typically less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such coinvestment may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such coinvestment in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership’s objectives the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such coinvestment in the event that such coinvestment or the partners in such coinvestment become insolvent or bankrupt or fail to develop or operate the property in the manner anticipated and expected the operating partnership may not receive the expected return in its expected timeframe or at all and may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the coinvestment additionally the preferred return negotiated on these coinvestments may be lower than the companys cost of funds the company may also incur losses if any guarantees or indemnifications were made by the company 

the company also owns properties indirectly under downreit structures the company has entered into and in the future may enter into transactions that could require the company to pay the tax liabilities of partners that contribute assets into downreits joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within the company’s control occur although the company plans to hold the contributed assets or if such assets consist of real property defer recognition of gain on sale of such assets pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code the company can provide no assurance that the company will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they could have a material impact on its financial position 

also from time to time the company invests in properties which may be subject to certain shared facilities agreements with homeowners associations and other entities andor invests in properties subject to ground leases where a subtenant may have certain similar rights to that of a party under such a shared facilities agreement for such properties the companys ability to control the expenditure of capital improvements and its allocation with such other parties may adversely affect the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

we may pursue acquisitions of other reits and real estate companies which may not yield anticipated results and could adversely affect our results of operations we may make acquisitions of andor investments in other reits and real estate companies that offer properties and communities to augment our market coverage or enhance our property offerings we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition investment alliance or joint venture opportunities that we will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us or that such transactions or relationships will be successful in addition our original estimates and assumptions used in assessing any acquisition may be inaccurate and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such acquisition 

these transactions or any other acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties for example as a consequence of such transactions we may assume unknown liabilities which could ultimately lead to material costs for us in addition the integration of acquired businesses or other acquisitions may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business to integrate acquired businesses or other acquisitions we must implement our management information systems operating systems and internal controls and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations the expected synergies from acquisitions may not be fully realized which could result in increased costs or other issues and have an adverse effect on our business there can be no assurance that all preacquisition property due diligence will have identified all material issues that might arise with respect to such acquired business and its properties or as to any such other acquisitions any future acquisitions we make may also require significant additional debt or equity financing which in the case of debt financing would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings and in the case of equity or equitylinked financing could be dilutive to essexs stockholders and the operating partnerships unitholders additionally the value of these investments could decline for a variety of reasons these and other factors could affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore the companys ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be limited real estate investments are illiquid and in our markets can at times be difficult to sell at prices we find acceptable we may be unable to consummate dispositions of properties or interests in properties in a timely manner on attractive terms or at all these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition if we are found to have held acquired or developed a community as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business federal tax laws may limit our ability to sell the community without incurring a 100 tax on the gain on the sale of the community and potentially adversely impacting our status as a reit unless we own the community through one of our taxable reit subsidiaries trss 

compliance with laws benefiting disabled persons may require the company to make significant unanticipated expenditures or impact the company’s investment strategy under the disabilities act all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons the fhaa requires that multifamily communities first occupied after march 13 1991 be accessible to handicapped tenants and visitors these and other federal state and local laws and regulations may require modifications to existing buildings or restrict certain renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons and may require other structural features which add to the cost of buildings under construction legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by disabled persons the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial noncompliance with these laws could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures 

the company may not be able to lease its retailcommercial space consistent with its projections or at market rates the company has retailcommercial space in its portfolio which represents approximately 2 of our total revenue the retailcommercial space at our properties among other things serves as an additional amenity for our tenants the long term nature of our retailcommercial leases and the characteristics of many of our retailcommercial tenants small local businesses may subject us to certain risks we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or at market rates and the longer term leases for existing space could result in below market rents over time also when leases for our existing retailcommercial space expire the space may not be relet on a timely basis or at all or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable than the current lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retailcommercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retailcommercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s portfolio may have environmental liabilities under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we have been required and may be required in the future regardless of our knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases naturally occurring substances such as methane and radon gas we may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for response costs property damage personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the impacts resulting from such releases while the company is unaware of any such response action required or damage claims associated with its existing properties which individually or in aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our business assets financial 

condition or results of operations potential future costs and damage claims may be substantial and could exceed any insurance coverage we may have for such events or such coverage may not exist further the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate any such impacts may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the impacted property in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of responding to hazardous or toxic substance or petroleum product releases 

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property the company carries certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk as to its properties however such coverage is not fully available for all properties and as to those properties for which limited coverage is fully available it may not apply to certain claims arising from known conditions present on those properties in general in connection with the ownership direct or indirect operation financing management and development of its communities the company could be considered as the owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances present there and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities the company may also be subject to governmental fines costs related to injuries to third parties andor damage to a third partys property 

properties which we plan to acquire undergo a preacquisition phase i environmental site assessment which is intended to afford the company protection against socalled owner liability under the primary federal environmental law as well as further environmental assessment which may involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling where conditions warranting such further assessment are identified and seller’s consent is obtained despite these assessments no assurance can be given that all environmental conditions present on or beneath or emanating from a given property will be discovered or that the full nature and extent of those conditions which are discovered will be adequately ascertained and quantified 

in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings the company does so pursuant to appropriate environmental regulatory requirements with the objective of obtaining regulatory closure or a no further action determination that will allow for future use development and sale of any impacted community 

certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials acms into the air or exposure to leadbased paint lbp and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of apartment communities for personal injury associated with acms or lbp 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed in a timely manner although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions the company has adopted policies for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold when it is detected and to minimize any impact mold might have on tenants of the affected property the company believes its mold policies and proactive response to address any known mold existence reduce its risk of loss from these cases however no assurance can be provided that the company has identified and responded to all mold occurrences 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as proposition 65 requiring that clear and reasonable warnings be given to persons who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke although the company has sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements we cannot assure you that the company will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 65 

methane gas is a naturallyoccurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas particularly in the southern california coastal areas methane is a nontoxic gas but is flammable and can be explosive at sufficient concentrations when in confined spaces and exposed to an ignition source naturallyoccurring methane gas is regulated at the state and federal level as a greenhouse gas but is not otherwise regulated as a hazardous substance however some local governments such as los angeles county require that new buildings constructed in areas designated methane gas zones install detection andor venting systems radon is also a naturallyoccurring gas that is found below the surface and can pose a threat to human health requiring abatement action if present in sufficient concentration within occupied areas the company cannot assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane or radon gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas 

we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental matters will not affect our ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations however the company is unaware of any pending or threatened alleged claim resulting from such matters which would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the company may incur general uninsured losses the company purchases general liability and property including loss of rent insurance coverage for each of its communities the company may also purchase limited earthquake terrorism environmental and flood insurance for some of its communities however there are types of losses generally catastrophic in nature such as losses due to wars acts of terrorism earthquakes pollution environmental matters or extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes fires and floods that are uninsurable or not economically insurable or may be insured subject to limitations such as large deductibles or copayments insurance risks associated with potential terrorist acts could sharply increase the premiums the company pays for coverage against property and casualty claims the company utilizes a wholly owned insurance subsidiary pacific western insurance llc pwi to selfinsure certain earthquake and property losses for some of the communities in its portfolio as of december 31 2019 pwi which is consolidated in the companys financial statements had cash and marketable securities of approximately 784 million the value of the marketable securities of pwi could decline and if a decline in value were to occur pwis ability to cover all or any portion of the amount of any insured losses could be adversely affected 

all of our communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity the company evaluates its financial loss exposure to seismic events by using actuarial loss models developed by the insurance industry and property vulnerability analyses based on structural evaluations by seismic consultants the company manages this exposure where considered appropriate desirable and costeffective by upgrading properties to increase their resistance to forces caused by seismic events by considering available funds and coverages provided by pwi andor in some cases by purchasing seismic insurance purchasing seismic insurance coverage can be costly and such seismic insurance is in limited supply as a result the company may experience a shortage in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of the insurance makes it in managements view not economically practical the company may purchase limited earthquake insurance for certain highdensity properties and in most cases properties owned by the companys coinvestments 

the company carries other types of insurance coverage related to a variety of risks and exposures including cyber risk insurance based on market conditions the company may change or potentially eliminate insurance coverages or increase levels of selfinsurance further we cannot assure you that the company will not incur losses which could be material due to uninsured risks deductibles and selfinsured retentions andor losses in excess of coverage limits 

we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets such as the metropolitan markets in southern california northern california and seattle these markets may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our communities both physically and financially or cause losses that exceed our insurance coverage our communities could also directly or indirectly be the location or target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks crimes shootings other acts of violence or other incidents beyond our control the occurrence of which could directly impact the value of our communities through damage destruction loss or increased security costs as well as operational losses due to reduction of traffic and rental demand for our communities and the availability of insurance for such acts may be limited or may be subject to substantial costs if such an incident were to occur at one of our communities we may also be subject to significant liability claims such events and losses could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and materially impair our ability to achieve our expected results additionally we may be obligated to continue to pay any mortgage indebtedness and other obligations relating to affected properties 

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees tenants and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material in the event of a substantial loss insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full replacement cost of the company’s lost investment or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the company’s ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed in addition certain causalities andor losses incurred may expose the company in the future to higher insurance premiums

in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing communities and could also require us to spend more on our new development communities without a corresponding increase in revenue for example various federal regional and state laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions including the recently updated california energy efficiency standards referred to as title 24 or the energy efficiency standards for residential and nonresidential buildings among other things green building codes may seek to reduce emissions through the imposition of standards for design construction materials water and energy usage and efficiency and waste management the imposition of such requirements in the future could increase the costs of maintaining or improving our existing properties or developing properties for example to improve their energy efficiency andor resistance to inclement weather without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our operating results further the impact of climate change may increase the cost of or make unavailable property insurance or other hazard insurance on terms we find acceptable or necessary to adequately protect our properties

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances including significant cash amounts at our wholly owned insurance subsidiary pwi as well as 401k plan assets in a limited number of financial institutions our cash balances are generally in excess of federally insured limits the failure or collapse of one or more of these financial institutions may materially adversely affect our ability to recover our cash balances or the 401k assets certain financial institutions are lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations additionally certain of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds

the company’s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap factors considered in evaluating impairment of the company’s existing multifamily real estate assets held for investment include significant declines in property operating profits recurring property operating losses and other significant adverse changes in general market conditions that are considered permanent in nature generally a multifamily real estate asset held for investment is not considered impaired if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows of the asset over its estimated holding period are in excess of the asset’s net book value at the balance sheet date assumptions used to estimate annual and residual cash flow and the estimated holding period of such assets require the judgment of management there can be no assurance that the company will not take charges in the future related to the impairment of the company’s assets any future impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which may preclude our developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair value of our land holdings which we determine is less that the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment changes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

under certain circumstances assets owned by a subsidiary reit may be required to be disposed of via a sale of capital stock rather than an asset sale under certain circumstances assets owned by a subsidiary reit may be required to be disposed of via a sale of capital stock rather than as an asset sale by that subsidiary reit which may limit the number of persons willing to acquire indirectly any assets held by that subsidiary reit as a result we may not be able to realize a return on our investment in a joint venture that utilizes a subsidiary reit structure at the time or on the terms we desire

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

capital and credit market conditions may affect the company’s access to sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could negatively affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to the company may be adversely affected our current balance sheet the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a diversified bank group access to the public and private placement debt markets and secured debt financing providers such as fannie mae and freddie mac provide some insulation from volatile capital markets we primarily use external financing including sales of debt and equity securities to fund acquisitions developments and redevelopments and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our acquisition development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income in general to the extent that the company’s access to capital and credit is at a higher cost than the company has experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing without a corresponding change to investment cap rates the company’s ability to make acquisitions develop or redevelop communities obtain new financing and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates could be adversely affected which would impact the companys financial standing and related credit rating in addition if our ability to obtain financing is adversely affected we may be unable to satisfy scheduled maturities on existing financing through other sources of our liquidity which in the case of secured financings could result in lender foreclosure on the apartment communities securing such debt 

debt financing has inherent risks at december 31 2019 the company had approximately 58 billion of indebtedness including 6604 million of variable rate indebtedness of which 1750 million is subject to an interest rate swap effectively fixing the interest rate on 1750 million in debt the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including among others the following 

 

the company may not be able to renew repay or refinance its indebtedness when due or may be required to refinance its indebtedness at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if the company is unable to refinance its indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all the company might be forced to dispose of one or more of its properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses such losses could have an adverse effect on the company and its ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders and pay amounts due on its debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and the company is unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequential loss of revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet reit distribution requirements 

debt financing of communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service debt and fund distributions where appropriate the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on the company’s investments and to provide for additional investments that the company could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the communities will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the reit distribution requirements of the code our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations working capital and capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms which in either case could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows to a certain extent our cash flow is subject to general economic industry regional financial competitive operating legislative regulatory taxation and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

as of december 31 2019 the company had 24 consolidated communities encumbered by debt with respect to such communities all of them are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those communities the holders of this indebtedness will have rights with respect to these communities and if debt payment obligations are not met lenders may seek foreclosure of communities which would reduce the company’s income and net asset value and its ability to service other debt 

compliance requirements of taxexempt financing and below market rent requirements may limit income from certain communities at december 31 2019 the company had approximately 2554 million of variable rate taxexempt financing this taxexempt financing provides for certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants the company expects to engage in taxexempt financings in the future if the compliance requirements of the taxexempt financing restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderate income tenants or eligiblequalified tenants then our income from these properties may be limited while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweigh any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed communities if the company is required to decrease its rental rates to attract tenants who satisfy the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for tenants satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and the company may be subject to additional contractual liability notwithstanding the limitations due to taxexempt financing requirements the income from certain communities may be limited due to below market rent requirements imposed by local authorities in connection with the original development of the community 

the indentures governing our notes and other financing arrangements contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility the indentures that govern our publicly registered notes contain financial and operating covenants that among other things restrict our ability to take specific actions even if we believe them to be in our best interests including restrictions on our ability to 

 

the instruments governing our other unsecured indebtedness require us to meet specified financial covenants including covenants relating to net worth fixed charge coverage debt service coverage the amounts of total indebtedness and secured indebtedness leverage and certain investment limitations these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies our ability to comply with these provisions and those contained in the indentures governing the notes may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance changes in general business and economic conditions adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting us the breach of any of these covenants including those contained in our indentures could result in a default under our indebtedness which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable if any of our indebtedness is accelerated we may not be able to repay it 

rising interest rates may affect the company’s costs of capital and financing activities and results of operation and otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock interest rates could increase which could result in higher interest expense on the company’s variable rate indebtedness or increase interest rates when refinancing maturing fixed rate debt prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company’s ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with positive economic returns on investment and the company’s ability to refinance existing borrowings in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

uncertainty relating to the libor calculation process and potential phasing out of libor after 2021 may materially adversely affect us the interest rate on certain of the company’s secured and unsecured debt obligations including the company’s two unsecured lines of credit is based on the libor in july 2017 the united kingdom regulator that regulates libor announced its intention to phase out libor rates by the end of 2021 furthermore in the united states the alternative reference rates committee of the federal reserve board has proposed replacing us dollar libor with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements  the secured overnight financing rate sofr at this time no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor and it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide libor submissions to the administrator of libor whether libor rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021 or whether any additional reforms to libor may be enacted in the united kingdom the united states or elsewhere any changes in the method used for determining libor may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in libor if a published us dollar libor rate is unavailable after 2021 the interest rates on certain of the company’s debt obligations could change uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes phase out alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the trading market for liborbased securities any of these proposals or consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financing costs and as a result our financial condition and results of operations 

interest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses the company from time to time uses interest rate swaps and interest rate caps contracts to manage certain interest rate risks although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest 

rates they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged the company may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the company to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk the company enters into hedging arrangements only with investment grade financial institutions 

a downgrade in the companys investment grade credit rating could materially and adversely affect its business and financial condition the company plans to manage its operations to maintain its investment grade credit rating with a capital structure consistent with its current profile but there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain its current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on the company’s cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on its financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

changes in the company’s financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness the company’s organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a limit on debt financing consistent with the existing covenants required to maintain the company’s unsecured line of credit bank facility unsecured debt and senior unsecured bonds although pursuant to this policy the company manages its debt to be in compliance with the debt covenants the company may increase the amount of outstanding debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in the company’s ability to service the additional debt accordingly the company could become more leveraged resulting in an increased risk of default on its debt covenants or on its debt obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements any covenant breach or significant increase in the company’s leverage could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

if the company or any of its subsidiaries defaults on an obligation to repay outstanding indebtedness when due the default could trigger a crossdefault or crossacceleration under other indebtedness if the company or any of its subsidiaries defaults on its obligations to repay outstanding indebtedness the default could cause a crossdefault or crossacceleration under other indebtedness a default under the agreements governing the company’s or its subsidiaries’ indebtedness including a default under mortgage indebtedness lines of credit bank term loan or the indenture for the company’s outstanding senior notes that is not waived by the required lenders or holders of outstanding notes could trigger crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions under one or more agreements governing the company’s indebtedness which could cause an immediate default or allow the lenders to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable 

the company could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac and by changes in government support for multifamily housing historically the company has utilized borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future the company primarily utilizes unsecured debt and repays secured debt at or near its respective maturity and places less reliance on agency mortgage debt financing potential options have been proposed for the future of agency mortgage finance in the united states that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing more generally it may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect the company and its growth and operations

the maryland general corporation law restricts the voting rights of holders of shares deemed to be control shares under the maryland general corporation law control shares are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the company’s stockholders 

the company’s charter and bylaws as well as maryland general corporation law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of essex’s board of directors and that in turn may delay defer or prevent a transaction including a change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the companys stockholders those provisions include among others 



 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or breach of the company’s privacy or information security systems or those of our vendors or other third parties could materially adversely affect the company’s business and financial condition the protection of tenant employee and company data is critically important to the company we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records personally identifiable information and tenant and lease data our business requires us including some of our vendors to use and store personally identifiable and other sensitive information of our tenants and employees the collection and use of personally identifiable information is governed by federal and state laws and regulations privacy and information security laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another the company endeavors to ensure compliance with all such laws and regulations including by providing required disclosures promptly responding to consumer requests for data and seeking vendor compliance with applicable privacy and information security laws compliance with all such laws and regulations may increase the company’s operating costs and adversely impact the company’s ability to market the company’s properties and services 

although we have taken steps to abide by privacy and security laws and to protect the security of our information systems and maintain confidential tenant prospective tenant and employee information the compliance and security measures put in place by the company and such vendors cannot guarantee perfect compliance or provide absolute security and the company and our vendors compliance systems andor information technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to criminal cyberattacks or data security incidents including ransom of data such as without limitation tenant andor employee information due to employee error malfeasance or other vulnerabilities any such incident could compromise the company’s or such vendors networks or the networks or systems of third parties that facilitate the company’s or such vendors’ business activities and the information stored by the company or such vendors could be accessed misused publicly disclosed corrupted lost or stolen resulting in fraud including wire fraud related to company assets or other harm moreover if there is a compliance failure or if a data security incident or breach affects the company’s systems or such vendors systems whether through a breach of the company’s systems or a breach of the systems of third parties or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information the company’s reputation and brand could be materially damaged which could increase our costs in attracting and retaining tenants and other serious consequences may result such potential other consequences include without limitation that the company and certain executive officers may be exposed to a risk of litigation and possible liability including without limitation government enforcement actions and private litigation and that the company may be exposed to a risk of loss including without limitation loss related to the fact that agreements with such vendors or such vendors financial condition may not allow the company to recover all costs related to a cyber breach for which they alone or they and the company should be jointly responsible for which could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

privacy and information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies such as ransomware and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks in light of the increased risks we have dedicated additional company resources to strengthening the security of the company’s computer systems including maintaining cyber risk insurance which may provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of cyber breaches however there can be no assurance that our cyber risk insurance will be sufficient in the event of a cyber incident 

in the future the company may expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company’s information security measures to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities andor to further ensure compliance with privacy and information security laws despite these steps there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer a significant data security incident in the future that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on the company’s systems or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner any failure in or breach of the companys information security systems those of third party service providers or a breach of other third party systems that ultimately impacts the operational or information security systems of the company as a result of cyberattacks or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business and results of operations additionally government agencies involved in investigating any potential data security incidents may impose injunctive relief or other civil or criminal penalties on the company andor certain executives which could among other things divert the attention of management impact the companys ability to collect and use tenant information materially increase data security costs andor otherwise require us to alter how we operate our business further the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data such as phishing and other forms of human engineering are increasing in sophistication and are often novel or change 

frequently accordingly the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures 

expanding social media vehicles present new risks  the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or information leakage negative posts or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our reputation in addition employees or others might disclose nonpublic sensitive information relating to our business through external media channels the continuing evolution of social media will present us with new challenges and risks 

employee theft or fraud could result in loss certain of our employees have access to or signature authority with respect to bank accounts or other company assets which exposes us to the risk of fraud or theft in addition certain employees have access to key information technology it infrastructure and to tenant and other information that is commercially valuable should any employee compromise our it systems or misappropriate tenant or other information we could incur losses including significant financial or reputational harm from which full recovery cannot be assured we also may not have insurance that covers any losses in full or that covers losses from particular criminal acts potential liabilities for theft or fraud are not quantifiable and an estimate of possible loss cannot be made 

any material weaknesses identified in the companys internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on the company’s stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires the company to evaluate and report on its internal control over financial reporting if the company identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting the company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on the company’s stock price 

tax risks 

sales of apartment communities could incur tax risks  if we are found to have held acquired or developed a community as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business federal tax laws may limit our ability to sell the community without incurring a 100 tax on the gain on the sale of the community and potentially adversely impacting our status as a reit unless we own the community through one of our trss 

loss of the companys reit status would have significant adverse consequences to the company and the value of the companys common stock  the company has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code the company’s qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy various annual and quarterly requirements including income asset and distribution tests established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 

to qualify under the income test i at least 75 of the company’s annual gross income generally must be derived from rents from real property mortgage interest gain from the sale or other disposition of real property held for investment dividends or other distributions on and gain from the sale or other disposition of shares of other reits and certain other limited categories of income and ii at least 95 of the company’s annual gross income generally must be derived from the preceding sources plus other dividends interest other than mortgage interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock and securities held for investment to qualify under the asset test at the end of each quarter at least 75 of the value of the company’s assets must consist of cash cash items government securities and qualified real estate assets and there are significant additional limitations regarding the company’s investment in securities other than government securities and qualified real estate assets including limitations on the percentage of our assets that can be represented by the company’s trss to comply with the distribution test the company generally must distribute to its stockholders each calendar year at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined before a deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain in addition to the extent the company satisfies the 90 test but distributes less than 100 of its reit taxable income it will be subject to corporate income tax on such undistributed income and could be subject to an additional 4 excise tax because the company needs to meet these tests to maintain its qualification as a reit it could cause the company to have to forgo certain business opportunities and potentially require the company to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 

in addition to the income asset and distribution tests described above the company’s qualification as a reit involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company’s control although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enable it to qualify as a reit it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year the company would be subject to us federal income tax on the company’s taxable income at corporate rates and the company could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for taxable years prior to 2018 and the company would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income the company would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to essex stockholders and operating partnership unitholders and the company would no longer be 

required to make distributions to its stockholders for the purpose of maintaining reit status as a result of all these factors the company’s failure to qualify as a reit also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value and market price of the company’s common stock 

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on the company or its stockholders the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive legislation could adversely affect the company or its stockholders new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in the company also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

the 2017 tax legislation has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders the legislation remains unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the us department of the treasury and internal revenue service any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation in addition it remains unclear how these us federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities because state and local tax laws may adopt some of the basebroadening provisions of the 2017 tax legislation such as the limitation on the deduction for net interest expense while not adopting corresponding rate reductions state and local tax liabilities may increase while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect the company in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis the company continues to work with its tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the 2017 tax legislation as a whole will have on the company 

the company’s ownership of trss is subject to certain restrictions and it will be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on certain income or deductions if transactions with the company’s trss are not conducted on arm’s length terms the company has established several trss the trss must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its trss do not adversely affect its reit qualification it cannot provide assurances that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore the company may be subject to a 100 penalty tax to the extent dealings between the company and its trss are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature the company intends that its dealings with its trss will be on an arm’s length basis no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not assert a contrary position 

failure of one or more of the company’s subsidiaries to qualify as a reit could adversely affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit the company owns interests in multiple subsidiary reits that have elected to be taxed as reits under the code these subsidiary reits are subject to the various reit qualification requirements and other limitations that are applicable to the company if any of the company’s subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit then i the subsidiary reit would become subject to federal income tax and ii the company’s ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit would cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits if any of the company’s subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as reits it is possible that the company could also fail to qualify as a reit 

the tax imposed on reits engaging in prohibited transactions may limit the company’s ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes from time to time the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties under the code unless certain exceptions apply any gain resulting from transfers of properties that the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business could be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since the company acquires properties for investment purposes it does not believe that its occasional transfers or disposals of property should be treated as prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by the company are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then the company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to it from the prohibited transaction and the company’s ability to retain proceeds from real property sales may be jeopardized 

dividends payable by reits may be taxed at higher rates than dividends of nonreit corporations which could reduce the net cash received by stockholders and may be detrimental to the company’s ability to raise additional funds through any future sale of its stock dividends paid by reits to us stockholders that are individuals trusts or estates are generally not eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividends received from nonreit corporations however under the 

2017 tax legislation us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates generally may deduct 20 of ordinary dividends from a reit for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends this may cause investors to view reit investments as less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock in reits including the companys stock 

nonus investors that invest in the company should be aware of the following us federal income tax considerations in connection with such investment first distributions by the company from its current and accumulated earnings and profits are subject to a 30 us withholding tax in the hands of nonus investors unless the 30 is reduced by an applicable income tax treaty such distributions may also be subject to a 30 withholding tax under the foreign account tax compliance act fatca unless a nonus investor complies with certain requirements prescribed by fatca second distributions by the company that are attributable to gains from dispositions of us real property capital gain dividends will be treated as income that is effectively connected with a us trade or business in the hands of a nonus investor such that a nonus investor will have us federal income tax payment and filing obligations with respect to capital gain dividends furthermore capital gain dividends may be subject to an additional 30 branch profits tax which may be reduced by an applicable income tax treaty in the hands of a nonus investor that is a corporation third any gain derived by a nonus investor on a disposition of such investor’s stock in the company will subject such investor to us federal income tax payment and filing requirements unless the company is treated as a domesticallycontrolled reit a reit is domestically controlled if less than 50 of the reit’s capital stock by value has been owned directly or indirectly by persons who are not qualifying us persons during a continuous fiveyear period ending on the date of disposition or if shorter during the entire period of the reit’s existence the company believes that it is a domesticallycontrolled reit but no assurances can be given in this regard notwithstanding the foregoing even if the company were not a domesticallycontrolled reit under a special exception nonus investors should not have us federal income tax payment and filing obligations on capital gain dividends or a disposition of their stock in the company if i they did not own more than 10 of such stock at any time during the oneyear period ending on the date of the disposition and ii the company’s stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market located in the united states and certain other nonus investors may also not be subject to these payment and filing obligations nonus investors should consult with their independent advisors as to the above us tax considerations and other us tax consequences of an investment in the company’s stock in light of their particular circumstances 

we may face risks in connection with section 1031 exchanges from time to time we dispose of real properties in transactions intended to qualify as likekind exchanges under section 1031 of the code if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable we may face adverse consequences and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed we may not be able to dispose of real properties on a tax deferred basis 

if the operating partnership failed to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes the company could cease to qualify as a reit and suffer other adverse consequences the company believes that the operating partnership will continue to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes as a partnership the operating partnership is not subject to us federal income tax on its income instead each of its partners is required to pay tax on the partner’s allocable share of the income of the operating partnership no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not challenge the operating partnership’s status as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the internal revenue service were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes the company could fail to meet the income tests andor the asset tests applicable to reits and accordingly cease to qualify as a reit also the failure of the operating partnership to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for distribution to its partners 

partnership tax audit rules could have a material adverse effect on us the bipartisan budget act of 2015 changed the rules applicable to us federal income tax audits of partnerships under the rules effective for taxable years beginning in 2018 among other changes and subject to certain exceptions any audit adjustment to items of income gain loss deduction or credit of a partnership and a partner’s allocable share thereof is determined and taxes interest and penalties attributable thereto are assessed and collected at the partnership level unless the partnership makes an election permitted under the new law or takes certain steps to require the partners to pay their tax on their allocable shares of the adjustment it is possible that partnerships in which we directly or indirectly invest would be required to pay additional taxes interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment we as a direct or indirect partner of these partnerships could be required to bear the economic burden of those taxes interest and penalties even though essex as a reit may not otherwise have been required to pay additional corporate‑level taxes had we owned the assets of the partnership directly the partnership tax audit rules apply to essex portfolio lp and its subsidiaries that are classified as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes the changes created 

by these rules are significant for collecting tax in partnership audits and accordingly there can be no assurance that these rules will not have a material adverse effect on us

none  




 item 2 properties 

the company’s portfolio as of december 31 2019 including communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures but excluding communities underlying preferred equity investments was comprised of 250 stabilized operating apartment communities comprising 60570 apartment homes of which 26695 apartment homes are located in southern california 21642 apartment homes are located in northern california and 12233 apartment homes are located in the seattle metropolitan area the company’s apartment communities accounted for 993 of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2019  

occupancy rates 

financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental income by total potential rental income total potential rental income represents the value of all apartment homes with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents when calculating actual rents for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes delinquencies and concessions are not taken into account the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates and the companys calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy as disclosed by other reits market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes the company may increase or decrease these rates based on a variety of factors including overall supply and demand for housing concentration of new apartment deliveries within the same submarket which can cause periodic disruption due to greater rental concessions to increase leasing velocity and rental affordability 

for communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while a community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual income is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy 

communities 

the company’s communities are primarily urban and suburban high density wood frame communities comprising of three to seven stories above grade construction with structured parking situated on 110 acres of land with densities averaging between 3080 units per acre as of december 31 2019  the company’s communities include 103 gardenstyle 137 midrise and 10 highrise communities gardenstyle communities are generally defined as ongrade properties with two andor threestory buildings with no structured parking while midrise communities are generally defined as properties with three to seven story buildings and some structured parking highrise communities are typically defined as properties with buildings that are greater than seven stories are steel or concrete framed and frequently have structured parking the communities have an average of approximately 242 apartment homes with a mix of studio one two and some threebedroom apartment homes a wide variety of amenities are available at the company’s communities including covered parking fireplaces swimming pools clubhouses with fitness facilities playground areas and dog parks

results of operations 

comparison of year ended december 31 2019 to the year ended december 31 2018 

the company’s average financial occupancy for the company’s stabilized apartment communities or 2019 sameproperty stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  decreased 10 basis points to 966 in 2019 from 967 in 2018  financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental income by total potential rental income actual rental income represents contractual rental income pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total potential rental income represents the value of all apartment homes with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant apartment home at its estimated market rate 

market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes the company may increase or decrease these rates based on a variety of factors including overall supply and demand for housing concentration of new apartment deliveries within the same submarket which can cause periodic disruption due to greater rental concessions to increase leasing velocity and rental affordability financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates and the companys calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy disclosed by other reits 

the company does not take into account delinquency and concessions to calculate actual rent for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes the calculation of financial occupancy compares contractual rates for occupied apartment homes to estimated market rents for unoccupied apartment homes and thus the calculation compares the gross value of all apartment homes excluding delinquency and concessions for apartment communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while an apartment community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual income is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy 

the regional breakdown of the company’s 2019 sameproperty portfolio for financial occupancy for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 is as follows

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table sets forth the company’s cash flows for 2019  2018 and 2017  in thousands 



essex’s business is operated primarily through the operating partnership essex issues public equity from time to time but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself other than incurring certain expenses from operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the operating partnership essex itself does not hold any indebtedness and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the operating partnership essex’s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock and preferred stock essex’s sole source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the operating partnership 

as of december 31 2019  essex owned a 966 general partner interest and the limited partners owned the remaining 34 interest in the operating partnership 

the liquidity of essex is dependent on the operating partnership’s ability to make sufficient distributions to essex the primary cash requirement of essex is its payment of dividends to its stockholders essex also guarantees some of the operating partnership’s debt as discussed further in notes 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k if the operating partnership fails to fulfill certain of its debt requirements which trigger essex’s guarantee obligations then essex will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees however essex’s only significant asset is its investment in the operating partnership 

for essex to maintain its qualification as a reit it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding net capital gains while historically essex has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of other property including in limited circumstances essex’s own stock as a result of this distribution requirement the operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not reits can essex may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating partnership’s working capital needs acquisitions and developments 

at december 31 2019  the company had 701 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and 1442 million in marketable securities of which 715 million were equity securities or available for sale debt securities the company believes that cash flows generated by its operations existing cash and cash equivalents marketable securities balances availability under existing lines of credit access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of the company’s reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2020  the timing source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment which can affect the company’s plans for acquisitions dispositions development and redevelopment activities

derivative activity 

the company uses interest rate swaps interest rate caps and total return swap contracts to manage certain interest rate risks the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate swaps and total return swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts or payments and the discounted expected variable cash payments or receipts the variable cash payments or receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 

the company has entered into interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 1750 million that effectively fixed the interest rate on the 1750 million of the 3500 million unsecured term loan at 23 these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting

as of december 31 2019  the company had no interest rate caps as of december 31 2018 the company had interest rate caps which were not accounted for as hedges totaling a notional amount of 99 million that effectively limited the company’s exposure to interest rate risk by providing a ceiling on the variable interest rate for 99 million of the company’s tax exempt variable rate debt these interest rate caps matured in december 2019 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the aggregate carrying value of the interest rate swap contracts was an asset of 10 million and 58 million  respectively and is included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and a liability of 02 million and zero  respectively and is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets the aggregate carrying value of the interest rate caps was zero on the balance sheets as of both december 31 2019 and 2018 the aggregate carrying and fair value of the total return swaps was zero at both december 31 2019 and 2018

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of 

contingent assets and liabilities the company defines critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require the companys management to exercise their most difficult subjective and complex judgments the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates relate principally to the following key areas i accounting for the acquisition of investments in real estate specifically the allocation between land and buildings and ii evaluation of events and changes in circumstances indicating whether the company’s rental properties may be impaired the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 

the company accounts for its acquisitions of investments in real estate by assessing each acquisition to determine if it meets the definition of a business or if it qualifies as an asset acquisition we expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions and result in the capitalization of acquisition costs and the allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair value of the respective assets and liabilities 

in making estimates of relative fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price the company utilizes a number of sources including independent land appraisals which consider comparable market transactions its own analysis of recently acquired or developed comparable properties in our portfolio for land comparables and building replacement costs and other publicly available market data in calculating the fair value of identified intangible assets of an acquired property the inplace leases are valued based on inplace rent rates and amortized over the average remaining term of all acquired leases 

the company periodically assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments for indicators of impairment the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties including the net operating income for the most recent 12 month period monitoring estimated costs for properties under development the companys ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset and each propertys remaining useful life whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property 

when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 

the company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 

net operating income 

net operating income noi and sameproperty noi are considered by management to be important supplemental performance measures to earnings from operations included in the company’s consolidated statements of income the presentation of sameproperty noi assists with the presentation of the company’s operations prior to the allocation of depreciation and any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual communities or groups of communities in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets the company defines sameproperty noi as sameproperty revenues less sameproperty operating expenses including property taxes please see the reconciliation of earnings from operations to noi and sameproperty noi which in the table below is the noi for stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the periods presented  in thousands

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

interest rate hedging activities 

the company’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks to accomplish this objective the company uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy as of december 31 2019  the company had entered into five interest rate swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in the interestrelated cash outflows on 1750 million of the unsecured term debt as of december 31 2019  the company also had 2554 million of secured variable rate indebtedness all of the company’s interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges as of december 31 2019  the following table summarizes the notional amount carrying value and estimated fair value of the company’s cash flow hedge derivative instruments used to hedge interest rates as of december 31 2019  the notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a particular security that is currently hedged at one time but does not represent exposure to credit interest rates or market risks the table also includes a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the impact on the company’s derivative instruments from an increase or decrease in 10year treasury bill interest rates by 50 basis points as of december 31 2019  



additionally the company has entered into total return swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 2554 million that effectively convert 2554 million of fixed mortgage notes payable to a floating interest rate based on the sifma plus a spread and have a carrying value of zero at december 31 2019 the company is exposed to insignificant interest rate risk on these swaps as the related mortgages are callable at par by the company coterminus with the termination of any related swap these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting

 item 1a risk factors 

for purposes of this section the term stockholders means the holders of shares of essex property trust inc’s common stock set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to essex property trust inc’s stockholders and essex portfolio lp’s unitholders you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our company our properties and our business 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual operating results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

risks related to our real estate investments and operations 

general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values  real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks if the communities and other real estate investments do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and the ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders will be adversely affected income from the communities may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

 

as leases at the communities expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to the company income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws including without limitation the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the disabilities act fair housing amendment act of 1988 the fhaa permanent and temporary rent control laws rent stabilization laws other laws regulating housing that may prevent the company from raising rents to offset increased operating expenses and tax laws 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents and the company may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire  substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less if the company is unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then the company’s results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected with these short term leases our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

national and regional economic environments can negatively impact the company’s liquidity and operating results  the companys forecast for the national economy assumes growth of the gross domestic product of the national economy and the economies of the west coast states in the event of a recession the company could incur reductions in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising and turnover expenses a recession may affect consumer confidence and spending and negatively impact the volume and pricing of real estate transactions which could negatively affect the company’s liquidity and its ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes to the economy furthermore if residents do not experience increases in their income they may be unable or unwilling to pay rent increases and delinquencies in rent payments and rent defaults may increase 

rent control or other changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect the companys operations or expose us to liability  the company must own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop its properties in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes rent control or stabilization laws federal state and local tax laws landlord tenant laws environmental laws employment laws immigration laws and other laws regulating housing or that are generally applicable to the companys business and operations noncompliance with laws could expose the company to liability if the company does not comply with any or all of these requirements it may have to pay fines to government authorities or damage awards to private litigants the company does not know whether these requirements will change or whether new requirements will be imposed changes in or noncompliance with these regulatory requirements could require the company to make significant unanticipated expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in addition rent control or rent stabilization laws and other regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to increase rents and pass through new or increased operating costs to our tenants there has been a recent increase in municipalities including those in which we own properties considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions which could limit our ability to raise rents based solely on market conditions these initiatives and any other future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing as well as any lawsuits against the company arising from such rent control or other laws may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs such laws and regulations limit our ability to charge market rents increase rents evict tenants or recover increases in our operating expenses and could reduce the value of our communities or make it more difficult for us to dispose of properties in certain circumstances expenses associated with our investment in these communities such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from the community furthermore such regulations may negatively impact our ability to attract higherpaying tenants to such communities 

acquisitions of communities involve various risks and uncertainties and may fail to meet expectations  the company intends to continue to acquire apartment communities however there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet the company’s expectations the company’s estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow the company to market an acquired apartment community as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate in addition following an acquisition the value and operational performance of an apartment community may be diminished if obsolescence or neighborhood changes occur before we are able to redevelop or sell the community also in connection with such acquisitions we may assume unknown liabilities which could ultimately lead to material costs for us that we did not expect to incur the company expects to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or joint ventures or additional equity by the company the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the company’s existing stockholders if the company finances new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless the company obtains substitute financing the company may not be able to undertake additional borrowing for further acquisitions or developments or such borrowing may be not available on advantageous terms 

development and redevelopment activities may be delayed not completed andor not achieve expected results  the company pursues development and redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals which have no assurance of being received andor the timing of which may be delayed from the company’s expectations the company defines development projects as new communities that are being constructed or are newly constructed and are in a phase of leaseup and have not yet reached stabilized operations and redevelopment projects as existing properties owned or recently acquired that have been targeted for additional investment by the company with the expectation of increased financial returns through property improvement as of december 31 2018 the company had four consolidated development projects and two joint venture development projects comprised of 1861 apartment homes for an estimated cost of 12 billion of which 4170 million remains to be expended and 3100 million is the companys share in addition at december 31 2018 the company had ownership interests in five major redevelopment projects aggregating 1727 apartment homes with estimated redevelopment costs of 1401 million of which approximately 278 million remains to be expended 

the company’s development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including among others 



 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the essex’s stockholders and the operating partnerships unitholders further the development and redevelopment of communities is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see the risk factor above titled  general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values 

investments in mortgages mezzanine loans subordinated debt other real estate and other marketable securities could adversely affect the company’s cash flow from operations the company may invest in equity preferred equity or debt securities related to real estate andor other investment securities andor cash investments which could adversely affect the company’s ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders including without limitation due to a decline in the value of such investments the company may also purchase or otherwise invest in securities issued by entities which own real estate andor invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations such mortgages may be first second or third mortgages and these mortgages andor other investments may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed the company may make or acquire mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity or entities that owns the interest in the entity owning the property in general investments in mortgages include the following risks 

 

if any of the above were to occur it could adversely affect the company’s cash flows from operations 

our apartment communities may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities which could cause us to incur substantial costs the properties that the company owns or may acquire are or may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which the company may have no recourse or only limited recourse against the sellers in general the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements related to the sales of the properties may not survive the closing of the transactions while the company will seek to require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive such indemnification may be limited and subject to various materiality thresholds a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses as a result there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties in addition the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with apartment communities may exceed our expectations and we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the geographic concentration of the company’s communities and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and operating results  the company generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  from the company’s communities concentrated in southern california los angeles orange santa barbara san diego and ventura counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area for the year ended december 31 2018  83  of the company’s rental revenues were generated from communities located in california this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls 

below expectations in general factors that may adversely affect local market and economic conditions include among others the following 

 

because the company’s communities are primarily located in southern california northern california and the seattle metropolitan area the company is exposed to greater economic concentration risks than if it owned a more geographically diverse portfolio the company is susceptible to adverse developments in california and washington economic and regulatory environments such as increases in real estate and other taxes and increased costs of complying with governmental regulations in addition the state of california is generally regarded as more litigious and more highly regulated and taxed than many states which may reduce demand for the company’s communities any adverse developments in the economy or real estate markets in california or washington or any decrease in demand for the company’s communities resulting from the california or washington regulatory or business environments could have an adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company may experience various increased costs including increased property taxes to own and maintain its properties   real property taxes on our properties may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change thus our real estate taxes in the state of washington could increase as a result of property value reassessments or increased property tax rates in that state a current california law commonly referred to as proposition 13 generally limits annual real estate tax increases on california properties to 2 of assessed value however under proposition 13 property tax reassessment generally occurs as a result of a change in ownership of a property as specially defined for purposes of those rules because the property taxing authorities may not determine whether there has been a change in ownership or the actual reassessed value of a property for a period of time after a transaction has occurred we may not know the impact of a potential reassessment for a considerable amount of time following a particular transaction therefore the amount of property taxes we are required to pay could increase substantially from the property taxes we currently pay or have paid in the past including on a retroactive basis in addition from time to time voters and lawmakers have announced initiatives to repeal or amend proposition 13 to eliminate its application to commercial and industrial property andor introduce split tax roll legislation such initiatives if successful could increase the assessed value andor tax rates applicable to commercial property in california including our apartment communities further changes in us federal tax law including us tax legislation enacted in december 2017 the 2017 tax legislation could cause state and local governments to alter their taxation of real property 

the company may experience increased costs associated with capital improvements and routine property maintenance such as repairs to the foundation exterior walls and rooftops of its properties as its properties advance through their lifecycles in some cases we may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or maintenance increases in the company’s expenses to own and maintain its properties could adversely impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

competition in the apartment community market and other housing alternatives may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for the company’s communities  there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting tenants these include other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent or for sale in the markets in which our communities are located competitive housing in a particular area and the increasing affordability of owneroccupied single and multifamily homes caused by lower housing prices mortgage interest rates and government programs to promote home ownership or create additional rental andor other types of housing could adversely affect the company’s ability to retain its tenants lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents if the demand for the company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing apartment communities rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations the company also faces competition from other companies reits businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities this competition may result in an increase in prices and costs of apartment communities that the company acquires andor develops 

the company’s ownership of coinvestments including joint ventures and joint ownership of communities its ownership of properties with shared facilities with a homeowners association or other entity its ownership of properties subject to a ground lease and its preferred equity investments and its other partial interests in entities that own communities could limit the company’s ability to control such communities and may restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in these properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated 

the company has entered into and may continue in the future to enter into certain coinvestments including joint ventures or partnerships through which it owns an indirect economic interest in less than 100 of the community or land or other investments owned directly by the joint venture or partnership as of december 31 2018  the company had through several joint ventures an interest in 10613 apartment homes in operating communities for a total book value of 8333 million 

joint venture partners often have shared control over the development and operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company’s business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to the company’s instructions or requests or its policies or objectives consequently a joint venture partners actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives the company may be unable to take action without its joint venture partners’ approval a joint venture partner might fail to approve decisions that are in the company’s best interests should a joint venture partner become bankrupt the company could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities in some instances the company and the joint venture partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause the company to sell its interest or acquire a partner’s interest at a time when the company otherwise would have not have initiated such a transaction 

from time to time the company through the operating partnership invests in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing financing or managing real property for example the company has made coinvestments in the form of preferred equity investments in third party entities that own real estate and may continue in the future to make such preferred equity or other coinvestments with preferred equity investments and certain other coinvestments the operating partnership’s interest in a particular entity is typically less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such coinvestment may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such coinvestment in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership’s objectives the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such coinvestment in the event that such coinvestment becomes insolvent or fails to develop or operate the property in the manner anticipated and expected the operating partnership may not receive the expected return in its expected timeframe or at all and may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the coinvestment the company may also incur losses if any guarantees or indemnifications were made by the company 

the company also owns properties indirectly under downreit structures the company has entered into and in the future may enter into transactions that could require the company to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets into downreits joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within the company’s control occur although the company plans to hold the contributed assets or if such assets consist of real property defer recognition of gain on sale of such assets pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code the company can provide no assurance that the company will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they could have a material impact on its financial position 

also from time to time the company invests in properties which may be subject to certain shared facilities agreements with homeowners associations and other entities andor invests in properties subject to ground leases where a subtenant may have certain similar rights to that of a party under such a shared facilities agreement for such properties the companys ability to control the expenditure of capital improvements and its allocation with such other parties may adversely affect the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

we may pursue acquisitions of other reits and real estate companies which may not yield anticipated results and could adversely affect our results of operations we may make acquisitions of and investments in other reits and real estate companies that offer properties and communities to augment our market coverage or enhance our property offerings we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition investment alliance or joint venture opportunities that we will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us or that such transactions or relationships will be 

successful in addition our original estimates and assumptions used in assessing any acquisition may be inaccurate and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such acquisition 

these transactions or any other acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties for example as a consequence of such transactions we may assume unknown liabilities which could ultimately lead to material costs for us in addition the integration of acquired businesses or other acquisitions may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business to integrate acquired businesses or other acquisitions we must implement our management information systems operating systems and internal controls and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations the expected synergies from acquisitions may not be fully realized which could result in increased costs or other issues and have an adverse effect on our business there can be no assurance that all preacquisition property due diligence will have identified all material issues that might arise with respect to such acquired business and its properties or as to any such other acquisitions any future acquisitions we make may also require significant additional debt or equity financing which in the case of debt financing would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings and in the case of equity or equitylinked financing could be dilutive to essexs existing stockholders and the operating partnerships unitholders these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore the companys ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be limited  real estate investments are illiquid and in our markets can at times be difficult to sell at prices we find acceptable we may be unable to consummate such dispositions in a timely manner on attractive terms or at all these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition if we are found to have held acquired or developed a community as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business federal tax laws may limit our ability to sell the community without incurring a 100 tax on the gain on the sale of the community and potentially adversely impacting our status as a real estate investment trust reit unless we own the community through one of our taxable reit subsidiaries trss 

compliance with laws benefiting disabled persons may require the company to make significant unanticipated expenditures or impact the company’s investment strategy  under the disabilities act all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons the fhaa requires that multifamily communities first occupied after march 13 1991 be accessible to handicapped tenants and visitors these and other federal state and local laws and regulations may require modifications to existing buildings or restrict certain renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons and may require other structural features which add to the cost of buildings under construction legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by disabled persons the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial noncompliance with these laws could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures 

the company may not be able to lease its retailcommercial space consistent with its projections or at market rates  the company has retailcommercial space in its portfolio which represents approximately 2  of our total revenue the retailcommercial space at our properties among other things serve as additional amenity for our tenants the long term nature of our retailcommercial leases and characteristics of many of our retailcommercial tenants small local businesses may subject us to certain risks we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or at market rates and the longer term leases for existing space could result in below market rents over time also when leases for our existing retailcommercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable that the current lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retailcommercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retailcommercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s portfolio may have environmental liabilities  under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we have been from time to time and may be required in the future regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases naturally occurring substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for response costs property damage personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the impacts 

resulting from such releases while the company is unaware of any such response action required or damage claims associated with its existing properties which individually or in aggregate would have a materially adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations potential future costs and damage claims may be substantial and could exceed any insurance coverage we may have for such events or such coverage may not exist further the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate any such impacts may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the impacted property in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of responding to hazardous or toxic substance or petroleum product releases 

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property the company carries certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk as to its properties however such coverage is not fully available for all properties and as to those properties for which limited coverage is fully available it may not apply to certain claims arising from known conditions present on those properties in general in connection with the ownership direct or indirect operation financing management and development of its communities the company could be considered as the owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances present there and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities the company may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to third persons and damage to their property 

properties which we intend to acquire undergo a preacquisition phase i environmental site assessment which is intended to afford the company protection against socalled owner liability under the primary federal environmental law as well as further environmental assessment which may involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling where conditions warranting such further assessment are identified and seller’s consent is obtained while such assessments are conducted in accordance with applicable all appropriate inquiry standards no assurance can be given that all environmental conditions present on or beneath or emanating from a given property will be discovered or that the full nature and extent of those conditions which are discovered will be adequately ascertained and quantified 

in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings the company does so pursuant to appropriate environmental regulatory requirements with the objective of obtaining regulatory closure or a no further action determination that will allow for future use development and sale of any impacted community 

certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials acms into the air or exposure to leadbased paint lbp and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of apartment communities for personal injury associated with acms or lbp 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed in a timely manner although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions the company has adopted policies for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold when it is detected and to minimize any impact mold might have on tenants of the property the company believes its mold policies and proactive response to address any known mold existence reduce its risk of loss from these cases however no assurance can be provided that the company has identified and responded to all mold occurrences 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as proposition 65 requiring that clear and reasonable warnings be given to persons who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke although the company has sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements we cannot assure you that the company will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 65 

methane gas is a naturallyoccurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas particularly in the southern california coastal areas methane is a nontoxic gas but is flammable and can be explosive at sufficient concentrations when in confined spaces and exposed to an ignition source naturallyoccurring methane gas is regulated at the state and federal level as a greenhouse gas but is not otherwise regulated as a hazardous substance however some local governments such as los angeles county require that new buildings constructed in areas designated methane gas zones install detection andor venting systems methane gas is also associated with certain industrial activities such as former municipal waste landfills radon is also a naturallyoccurring gas that is found below the surface and can pose a threat to human health requiring abatement action if present in sufficient concentration within occupied areas the company cannot assure you that it 

will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane or radon gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas 

we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental matters will not affect our ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations provided however the company is unaware of any pending or threatened alleged claim resulting from such matters which would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the company may incur general uninsured losses  the company purchases general liability and property including loss of rent insurance coverage for each of its communities the company may also purchase limited earthquake terrorism environmental and flood insurance for some of its communities however there are types of losses generally catastrophic in nature such as losses due to wars acts of terrorism earthquakes pollution environmental matters or extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes fires and floods that are uninsurable or not economically insurable or may be insured subject to limitations such as large deductibles or copayments insurance risks associated with potential terrorist acts could sharply increase the premiums the company pays for coverage against property and casualty claims the company utilizes a wholly owned insurance subsidiary pacific western insurance llc pwi to selfinsure certain earthquake and property losses for some of the communities in its portfolio as of december 31 2018 pwi has cash and marketable securities of approximately 866 million and is consolidated in the companys financial statements the value of the marketable securities of pwi could decline and if a decline in value were to occur pwis ability to cover all or any portion of the amount of any insured losses could be adversely affected 

all the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity the company evaluates its financial loss exposure to seismic events by using actuarial loss models developed by the insurance industry and in most cases property vulnerability analysis based on structural evaluations of seismic consultants the company manages this exposure where considered appropriate desirable and costeffective by upgrading properties to increase their resistance to forces caused by seismic events by considering available funds and coverages provided by pwi andor in some cases by purchasing seismic insurance purchasing seismic insurance coverage can be costly and such seismic insurance is in limited supply as a result the company may experience a shortage in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of the insurance makes it in managements view not economically practical the company may purchase limited earthquake insurance for certain highdensity properties and in most cases assets owned by the companys coinvestments 

the company carries other types of insurance coverage related to a variety of risks and exposures based on market conditions the company may change or potentially eliminate insurance coverages or increase levels of selfinsurance further we cannot assure you that the company will not incur losses which could be material due to uninsured risks deductibles and selfinsured retentions andor losses in excess of coverage limits 

we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets such as the metropolitan markets in southern california northern california and seattle these markets may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our communities both physically and financially or cause losses that exceed our insurance coverage our communities could also directly or indirectly be the location or target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks crimes shootings other acts of violence or other incidents beyond our control the occurrence of which could directly impact the value of our communities through damage destruction loss or increased security costs as well as operational losses due to reduction of traffic and rental demand for our communities and the availability of insurance for such acts may be limited or may be subject to substantial costs if such an incident were to occur at one of our communities we may also be subject to significant liability claims such events and losses could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and materially impair our ability to achieve our expected results additionally we may be obligated to continue to pay any mortgage indebtedness and other obligations relating to affected properties 

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees tenants and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material in the event of a substantial loss insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full replacement cost of the company’s lost investment or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the company’s ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed in addition certain causalities andor losses incurred may expose the company in the future to higher insurance premiums 

climate change may adversely affect our business to the extent that climate change does occur we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage or a decrease in demand for our communities located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing communities and could also require us to spend more on our new development communities without a corresponding increase in revenue for example various federal regional and state laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions including the recently updated california energy efficiency standards referred to as title 24 or the energy efficiency standards for residential and nonresidential buildings among other things green building codes may seek to reduce emissions through the imposition of standards for design construction materials water and energy usage and efficiency and waste management the imposition of such requirements in the future could increase the costs of maintaining or improving our existing properties or developing properties for example to improve their energy efficiency andor resistance to inclement weather without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our operating results further the impact of climate change may increase the cost of or make unavailable property insurance or other hazard insurance on terms we find acceptable or necessary to adequately protect our properties 

accidental death or severe injuries due to fires floods other natural disasters or hazards could adversely affect our business and results of operations  the accidental death or severe injuries of persons living in our communities due to fires floods other natural disasters or hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where any such events have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

adverse changes in laws may adversely affect the companys liabilities andor operating costs relating to its properties and its operations  increases in real estate taxes and income service and transfer taxes cannot always be passed through to tenants or users in the form of higher rents and may adversely affect the companys cash available for distribution and its ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders and pay amounts due on its debts similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability of the company andor its operating costs on a range of issues including those regarding potential liability for other environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions as well as changes in laws affecting development construction and safety requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures including without limitation those related to structural or seismic retrofit or more costly operational safety systems and programs which could have a material adverse effect on the company for example 1 the california statute the sustainable communities and climate protection act of 2008 also known as sb375 provides that in order to reduce greenhouse emissions there should be regional planning to coordinate housing needs with regional transportation and such planning could lead to restrictions on or increases in property development that adversely affect the company and 2 the environmental protection agency has implemented a program for longterm phase out of hcfc22 coolant freon by 2030 which could lead to increased capital andor operating costs 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us  we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances including significant cash amounts of our wholly owned insurance subsidiary pwi as well as 401k plan assets in a limited number of financial institutions our cash balances are generally in excess of federally insured limits the failure or collapse of one or more of these financial institutions may materially adversely affect our ability to recover our cash balances or the 401k assets certain financial institutions are lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations additionally certain of our taxexempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal and interest on the bonds the guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit surety bond guarantee agreement or other additional collateral if the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral a default will occur under the applicable taxexempt bonds and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the bonds 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit the company’s growth  the company may make acquisitions or commence development activity outside of its existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise the company’s historical experience in its existing markets does not ensure that it will be able to operate successfully in new markets the company may be exposed to a variety of risks if it chooses to enter new markets these risks include among others 

 

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to the fair value of tangible and intangible assets and the carrying value of our real estate investments often these estimates require the use of local market knowledge and data that is difficult to assess as well as estimates of future cash flows associated with our real estate investments that can also be difficult to accurately predict although our management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

our business and reputation depend on our ability to continue providing high quality housing and consistent operation of our communities the failure of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our business and reputation depend on providing tenants with quality housing with highly reliable services including with respect to water and electric power along with the consistent operation of our communities including a wide variety of amenities such as covered parking swimming pools clubhouses with fitness facilities playground areas tennis courts and similar features public utilities especially those that provide water and electric power are fundamental for the consistent operation of our communities the delayed delivery or any material reduction or prolonged interruption of these services may cause tenants to terminate their leases or may result in a reduction of rents andor increase in our costs or other issues in addition we may fail to provide quality housing and continuous access to amenities as a result of other factors including mechanical failure power outage human error vandalism physical or electronic security breaches war terrorism or similar events such service interruptions mechanical failures or other events may also expose us to additional liability claims and damage our reputation and brand and could cause tenants to terminate or not renew their leases or prospective tenants to seek housing elsewhere any such failures could impair our ability to continue providing quality housing and consistent operation of our communities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap factors considered in evaluating impairment of the company’s existing multifamily real estate assets held for investment include significant declines in property operating profits recurring property operating losses and other significant adverse changes in general market conditions that are considered permanent in nature generally a multifamily real estate asset held for investment is not considered impaired if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows of the asset over its estimated holding period are in excess of the asset’s net book value at the balance sheet date assumptions used to estimate annual and residual cash flow and the estimated holding period of such assets require the judgment of management there can be no assurance that the company will not take charges in the future related to the impairment of the company’s assets any future impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which may preclude our developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair value of our land holdings which we determine is less that the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment changes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

under certain circumstances assets owned by a subsidiary reit may be required to be disposed of via a sale of capital stock rather than an asset sale   under certain circumstances assets owned by a subsidiary reit may be required to be disposed of via a sale of capital stock rather than as an asset sale by that subsidiary reit which may limit the number of persons willing to acquire indirectly any assets held by that subsidiary reit as a result we may not be able to realize a return on our investment in a joint venture that utilizes a subsidiary reit structure at the time or on the terms we desire 

we may from time to time be subject to litigation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  we may be a party to various claims and routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business some of these claims or others to which we may be subject from time to time may result in defense costs settlements fines or judgments against us some of which are not or cannot be covered by insurance payment of any such costs settlements fines or judgments that are not insured could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured or adversely impact our ability to attract officers and directors 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

capital and credit market conditions may affect the company’s access to sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could negatively affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition  in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to the company may be adversely affected our current balance sheet the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a diversified bank group access to the public and private placement debt markets and secured debt financing providers such as fannie mae and freddie mac provides some insulation from volatile capital markets we primarily use external financing including sales of equity securities to fund acquisitions developments and redevelopments and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our acquisition development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income in general to the extent that the company’s access to capital and credit is at a higher cost than the company has experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing without a corresponding change to investment cap rates the company’s ability to make acquisitions develop communities obtain new financing and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates could be adversely affected which would impact the companys financial standing and related credit rating in addition if our ability to obtain financing is adversely affected we may be unable to satisfy scheduled maturities on existing financing through other sources of our liquidity which in the case of secured financings could result in lender foreclosure on the apartment communities securing such debt 

debt financing has inherent risks  at december 31 2018 the company had approximately 56 billion  of indebtedness including 6196 million  of variable rate indebtedness of which 1750 million is subject to an interest rate swap effectively fixing the interest rate on 1750 million in debt 99 million is subject to interest rate cap protection the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including among others the following 

 

the company may not be able to renew repay or refinance its indebtedness when due or may be required to refinance its indebtedness at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if the company is unable to refinance its indebtedness on acceptable terms or not at all the company might be forced to dispose of one or more of its properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses such losses could have an adverse effect on the company and its ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders and pay amounts due on its debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and the company is unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequential loss of revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet reit distribution requirements 

debt financing of communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service debt and fund distributions  where appropriate the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on the company’s investments and to provide for additional investments that the company could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the communities will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the reit distribution requirements of the code our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations working capital and capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms which in either case could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows to a certain extent our cash flow is subject to general economic 

industry regional financial competitive operating legislative regulatory taxation and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

as of december 31 2018 the company had 50 consolidated communities encumbered by debt with respect to such communities all of them are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those communities the holders of this indebtedness will have rights with respect to these communities and if debt payment obligations are not met lenders may seek foreclosure of communities which would reduce the company’s income and net asset value and its ability to service other debt 

compliance requirements of taxexempt financing and below market rent requirements may limit income from certain communities  at december 31 2018 the company had approximately 2696 million  of variable rate taxexempt financing this taxexempt financing provides for certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants the company expects to engage in taxexempt financings in the future if the compliance requirements of the taxexempt financing restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderate income tenants or eligiblequalified tenants then our income from these properties may be limited while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweigh any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed communities if the company is required to lower rental rates to attract tenants who satisfy the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for tenants satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and the company may be subject to additional contractual liability besides the limitations due to taxexempt financing requirements the income from certain communities may be limited due to below market rent bmr requirements imposed by local authorities in connection with the original development of the community 

the indentures governing our notes and other financing arrangements contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility  the indentures that govern our publicly registered notes contain financial and operating covenants that among other things restrict our ability to take specific actions even if we believe them to be in our best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

 

the instruments governing our other unsecured indebtedness require us to meet specified financial covenants including covenants relating to net worth fixed charge coverage debt service coverage the amounts of total indebtedness and secured indebtedness leverage and certain investment limitations these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies our ability to comply with these provisions and those contained in the indentures governing the notes may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance changes in general business and economic conditions adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting us the breach of any of these covenants including those contained in our indentures could result in a default under our indebtedness which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable if any of our indebtedness is accelerated we may not be able to repay it 

rising interest rates may affect the company’s costs of capital and financing activities and results of operation interest rates could increase which could result in higher interest expense on the company’s variable rate indebtedness or increase interest rates when refinancing maturing fixed rate debt prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company’s ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with positive economic returns on investment and the company’s ability to refinance existing borrowings 

interest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses the company from time to time uses interest rate swaps and interest rate caps contracts to manage certain interest rate risks although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged the company may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the company to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk the company enters into hedging arrangements only with investment grade financial institutions 

a downgrade in the companys investment grade credit rating could materially and adversely affect its business and financial condition the company plans to manage its operations to maintain its investment grade credit rating with a capital structure consistent with its current profile but there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain its current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on 

the company’s cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on its financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

changes in the company’s financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness  the company’s organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a limit on debt financing consistent with the existing covenants required to maintain the company’s unsecured line of credit bank facility unsecured debt and senior unsecured bonds although pursuant to this policy the company manages its debt to be in compliance with the debt covenants the company may increase the amount of outstanding debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in the company’s ability to service the additional debt accordingly the company could become more leveraged resulting in an increased risk of default of its debt covenants or on its debt obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements any covenant breach or significant increase in the company’s leverage could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

if the company or its subsidiaries defaults on an obligation to repay outstanding indebtedness when due the default could trigger a crossdefault or crossacceleration under other indebtedness  if the company or one of its subsidiaries defaults on its obligations to repay outstanding indebtedness the default could cause a crossdefault or crossacceleration under other indebtedness a default under the agreements governing the company’s or its subsidiaries’ indebtedness including a default under mortgage indebtedness lines of credit bank term loan or the indenture for the company’s outstanding senior notes that is not waived by the required lenders or holders of outstanding notes could trigger crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions under one or more agreements governing the company’s indebtedness which could cause an immediate default or allow the lenders to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable 

the company could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac and by changes in government support for multifamily housing   historically the company has utilized borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future beginning in 2011 the company has primarily utilized unsecured debt and has repaid secured debt at or near their respective maturity and has placed less reliance on agency mortgage debt financing potential options have been proposed for the future of agency mortgage finance in the us that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing more generally it may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect the company and its growth and operations 

risks related to the company in general and the ownership of essex’s stock 

the company depends on its key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed   the company’s success depends on its ability to attract and retain executive officers senior officers and company managers there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the departure of any of the company’s key personnel could have an adverse effect on the company 

the price per share of the company’s stock may fluctuate significantly the market price per share of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including without limitation 



 

many of the factors listed above are beyond the company’s control these factors may cause the market price of shares of the company’s common stock to decline regardless of the company’s financial condition results of operations or business prospects 

the company’s future issuances of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities could be dilutive to current stockholders and adversely affect the market price of the company’s common stock  in order to finance the company’s acquisition and development activities the company has issued and sold common stock preferred stock and convertible debt securities the company may in the future sell further shares of common stock including pursuant to its equity distribution program with citigroup global markets inc barclays capital inc bnp paribas securities corp btig llc capital one securities inc jefferies llc jp morgan securities llc mizuho securities usa llc mufg securities americas inc and scotia capital usa inc 

in 2018 the company filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec allowing the company to sell an undetermined number of equity and debt securities as defined in the prospectus future sales of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock as of december 31 2018 george m marcus the chairman of essex’s board of directors wholly or partially owned approximately 17 million shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships indirectly held shares of common stock and assuming exercise of all vested options mr marcus currently does not have majority control over the company however he currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all the company’s stockholders 

under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for certain amendments of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with the company the company’s directors and executive officers including mr marcus have substantial influence on the company consequently their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders 

our related party guidelines may not adequately address all of the issues that may arise with respect to related party transactions  the company has adopted related party transaction approval process guidelines that provide generally that any transaction in which a director or executive officer has an interest must have the prior approval of the audit committee of essexs board of directors the review and approval procedures in these guidelines are intended to determine whether a particular related party transaction is fair reasonable and serves the interests of the companys stockholders pursuant to these guidelines related party transactions have been approved from time to time there is no assurance that this policy will be

our score or rating by proxy advisory firms or other corporate governance consultants advising institutional investors could have an adverse effect on the perception of our corporate governance and thereby negatively impact the market price of our common stock various proxy advisory firms and other corporate governance consultants advising institutional investors provide scores or ratings of our governance measures nominees for election as directors executive compensation practices and other matters that may be submitted to stockholders for consideration at our annual meetings from time to time certain matters that we propose for approval may not receive a favorable score or rating or may result in a negative score or rating or recommendation against the nominee or matter proposed these unfavorable scores or ratings may lead to rejected proposals or a loss of stockholder confidence in our corporate governance measures which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we periodically review our corporate governance measures and consider implementing changes that we believe are responsive to concerns that have been raised but there may be times where we decide not to implement changes or other measures recommended by proxy advisors or other corporate governance consultants that we believe are contrary to the best interests of our stockholders notwithstanding the adverse effect this decision may have on our scores or ratings or the perception of our corporate governance thereby negatively impacting the market price of our common stock 

we could face adverse consequences as a result of actions of activist investors campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company responding to stockholder activism or engaging in a process or proxy contest may be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our management team and our employees from executing our business plan which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders   a decrease in rental revenue or liquidity needs such as the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our acquisition and development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations  the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

essex may choose to pay dividends in its own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive  we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in essexs stock taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of essexs stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of essexs stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

the maryland business combination act may delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control of the company that might involve a premium price for the companys stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders under the maryland general corporation law certain business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these business combinations include a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities an interested stockholder is defined as any person and certain affiliates of such person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock of the corporation the law also requires a two supermajority stockholder votes for such transactions this means that the transaction must be approved by at least 

 

the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under the maryland general corporation law as permitted by the statute the board of directors of essex irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination among the company george m marcus who is the chairman of the company and mmc or any entity owned or controlled by mr marcus and mmc consequently the fiveyear prohibition and supermajority vote requirements described above will not apply to any business combination between the company mr marcus or mmc as a result the company may in the future enter into business combinations with mr marcus and mmc without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland business combination act 

certain provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement charter and bylaws and certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law could delay defer or prevent a change in control while the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on the company’s power to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company’s stock or otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect their interests the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership the company may not without first obtaining the consent of a majority in interest of the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of the company’s general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity such limitations on the company’s power to act may result in the company’s being precluded from taking action that the board of directors otherwise believes is in the best interests of the company or its stockholders 

the company’s charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other terms of such stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock the company may establish one or more classes or series of stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control such a transaction might involve a premium price for the company’s stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of 

common stock also such a class or series of stock could have dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interests of holders of common stock 

the company’s charter contains provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

the maryland general corporation law restricts the voting rights of holders of shares deemed to be control shares under the maryland general corporation law control shares are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the company’s stockholders

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock as noted above we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our lines of credit where fluctuations in interest rates may cause our interest expense to rise which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or breach of the company’s privacy or information security systems or those of our vendors or other third parties could materially adversely affect the company’s business and financial condition  the protection of tenant employee and company data is critically important to the company we rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records personally identifiable information and tenant and lease data our business requires us including some of our vendors to use and store personally identifiable and other sensitive information of our tenants and employees the collection and use of personally identifiable information is governed by federal and state laws and regulations privacy and information security laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another compliance with all such laws and regulations may increase the company’s operating costs and adversely impact the company’s ability to market the company’s properties and services 

although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and maintain confidential tenant prospective tenant and employee information the security measures put in place by the company and such vendors cannot provide absolute security and the company and our vendors information technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to criminal cyberattacks or data security incidents including ransom of data such as without limitation tenant andor employee 

information due to employee error malfeasance or other vulnerabilities any such incident could compromise the company’s or such vendors networks or the networks or systems of third parties that facilitate the company’s or such vendors’ business activities and the information stored by the company or such vendors could be accessed misused publicly disclosed corrupted lost or stolen resulting in fraud including wire fraud related to company assets or other harm moreover if a data security incident or breach affects the company’s systems or such vendors systems whether through a breach of the company’s systems or a breach of the systems of third parties or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information the company’s reputation and brand could be materially damaged which could increase our costs in attracting and retaining tenants and other serious consequences may result such potential other consequences include without limitation that the company and certain executive officers may be exposed to a risk of litigation and possible liability including without limitation government enforcement actions and private litigation and that the company may be exposed to a risk of loss including without limitation loss related to the fact that agreements with such vendors or such vendors financial condition may not allow the company to recover all costs related to a cyber breach for which they alone or they and the company should be jointly responsible for which could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

privacy and information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies such as ransomware and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks in light of the increased risks we have dedicated additional company resources to strengthening the security of the company’s computer systems including maintaining cyber risk insurance which may provide some coverage for certain risks arising out of cyber breaches in the future the company may expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company’s information security measures andor to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities despite these steps there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer a significant data security incident in the future that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on the company’s systems or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner any failure in or breach of the companys information security systems those of third party service providers or a breach of other third party systems that ultimately impacts the operational or information security systems of the company as a result of cyberattacks or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business and results of operations additionally government agencies involved in investigating any potential data security incidents may impose injunctive relief or other civil or criminal penalties on the company andor certain executives which could among other things divert the attention of management impact the companys ability to collect and use tenant information materially increase data security costs andor otherwise require us to alter how we operate our business further the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data such as phishing and other forms of human engineering are increasing in sophistication and are often novel or change frequently accordingly the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures 

expanding social media vehicles present new risks  the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or information leakage negative posts or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our reputation in addition employees or others might disclose nonpublic sensitive information relating to our business through external media channels the continuing evolution of social media will present us with new challenges and risks 

employee theft or fraud could result in loss certain of our employees have access to or signature authority with respect to bank accounts or other company assets which exposes us to the risk of fraud or theft in addition certain employees have access to key information technology it infrastructure and to tenant and other information that is commercially valuable should any employee compromise our it systems or misappropriate tenant or other information we could incur losses including significant financial or reputational harm from which full recovery cannot be assured we also may not have insurance that covers any losses in full or that covers losses from particular criminal acts as of december 31 2018 potential liabilities for theft or fraud are not quantifiable and an estimate of possible loss cannot be made 

any material weaknesses identified in the companys internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on the company’s stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires the company to evaluate and report on its internal control over financial reporting if the company identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting the company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on the company’s stock price 

tax risks 

sales of apartment communities could incur tax risks  if we are found to have held acquired or developed a community as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business federal tax laws may limit our ability to sell the community without incurring a 100 tax on the gain on the sale of the community and potentially adversely impacting our status as a reit unless we own the community through one of our trss 

loss of the companys reit status would have significant adverse consequences to the company and the value of the companys common stock  the company has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code the company’s qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy various annual and quarterly requirements including income asset and distribution tests established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 

to qualify under the income test i at least 75 of the company’s annual gross income generally must be derived from rents from real property mortgage interest gain from the sale or other disposition of real property held for investment dividends or other distributions on and gain from the sale or other disposition of shares of other reits and certain other limited categories of income and ii at least 95 of the company’s annual gross income generally must be derived from the preceding sources plus other dividends interest other than mortgage interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock and securities held for investment to qualify under the asset test at the end of each quarter at least 75 of the value of the company’s assets must consist of cash cash items government securities and qualified real estate assets and there are significant additional limitations regarding the company’s investment in securities other than government securities and qualified real estate assets including limitations on the percentage of our assets that can be represented by the company’s trss to comply with the distribution test the company generally must distribute to its stockholders each calendar year at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined before a deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain in addition to the extent the company satisfies the 90 test but distributes less than 100 of its reit taxable income it will be subject to corporate income tax on such undistributed income and could be subject to an additional 4 excise tax because the company needs to meet these tests to maintain its qualification as a reit it could cause the company to have to forgo certain business opportunities and potentially require the company to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 

in addition to the income asset and distribution tests described above the company’s qualification as a reit involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company’s control although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enable it to qualify as a reit it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year the company would be subject to us federal income tax on the company’s taxable income at corporate rates and the company could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for taxable years prior to 2018 and the company would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income the company would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to essex stockholders and operating partnership unitholders and the company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders for the purpose of maintaining reit status as a result of all these factors the company’s failure to qualify as a reit also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value and market price of the company’s common stock 

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on the company or its stockholders  the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive legislation could adversely affect the company or its stockholders new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in the company also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

the 2017 tax legislation has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders changes made by the 2017 tax legislation that could affect the company and its stockholders include 



 

many of these changes that are applicable to us are effective beginning with our 2018 taxable year without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions the legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the us department of the treasury and internal revenue service any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation in addition it is unclear how these us federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities because state and local tax laws may adopt some of the basebroadening provisions of the 2017 tax legislation such as the limitation on the deduction for net interest expense while not adopting corresponding rate reductions state and local tax liabilities may increase while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect the company in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis the company continues to work with its tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the 2017 tax legislation as a whole will have on the company 

the company’s ownership of trss is subject to certain restrictions and it will be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on certain income or deductions if transactions with the company’s trss are not conducted on arm’s length terms  the company has established several trss the trss must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its trss do not adversely affect its reit qualification it cannot provide assurances that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore the company may be subject to a 100 penalty tax to the extent dealings between the company and its trss are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature the company intends that its dealings with its trss will be on an arm’s length basis no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not assert a contrary position 

failure of one or more of the company’s subsidiaries to qualify as a reit could adversely affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit  the company owns interests in multiple subsidiary reits that have elected to be taxed as reits under the code these subsidiary reits are subject to the various reit qualification requirements and other limitations that are applicable to the company if any of the company’s subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit then i the subsidiary reit would become subject to federal income tax and ii the company’s ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit would cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits if any of the company’s subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as reits it is possible that the company could also fail to qualify as a reit 

the tax imposed on reits engaging in prohibited transactions may limit the company’s ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes from time to time the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties under the code unless certain exceptions apply any gain resulting from transfers of properties that the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business could be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since the company acquires properties for investment purposes it does not believe that its occasional transfers or disposals of property should be treated as prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by the company are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then the company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to it from the prohibited transaction and the company’s ability to retain proceeds from real property sales may be jeopardized 

dividends payable by reits may be taxed at higher rates than dividends of nonreit corporations which could reduce the net cash received by stockholders and may be detrimental to the company’s ability to raise additional funds through any future sale of its stock dividends paid by reits to us stockholders that are individuals trusts or estates are generally not eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividends received from nonreit corporations however under the 2017 tax legislation us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates generally may deduct 20 of ordinary dividends from a reit for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends this may cause investors to view reit investments as less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock in reits including the companys stock 

nonus investors that invest in the company should be aware of the following us federal income tax considerations in connection with such investment first distributions by the company from its current and accumulated earnings and profits are subject to a 30 us withholding tax in the hands of nonus investors unless the 30 is reduced by an applicable income tax treaty such distributions may also be subject to a 30 withholding tax under the foreign account tax compliance act fatca unless a nonus investor complies with certain requirements prescribed by fatca second distributions by the company that are attributable to gains from dispositions of us real property capital gain dividends will be treated as income that is effectively connected with a us trade or business in the hands of a nonus investor such that a nonus investor will have us federal income tax payment and filing obligations with respect to capital gain dividends furthermore capital gain dividends may be subject to an additional 30 branch profits tax which may be reduced by an applicable income tax treaty in the hands of a nonus investor that is a corporation third any gain derived by a nonus investor on a disposition of such investor’s stock in the company will subject such investor to us federal income tax payment and filing requirements unless the company is treated as a domesticallycontrolled reit a reit is domestically controlled if less than 50 of the reit’s capital stock by value has been owned directly or indirectly by persons who are not qualifying us persons during a continuous fiveyear period ending on the date of disposition or if shorter during the entire period of the reit’s existence the company believes that it is a domesticallycontrolled reit but no assurances can be given in this regard notwithstanding the foregoing even if the company were not a domesticallycontrolled reit under a special exception nonus investors should not have us federal income tax payment and filing obligations on capital gain dividends or a disposition of their stock in the company if i they did not own more than 10 of such stock at any time during the oneyear period ending on the date of the disposition and ii the company’s stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market located in the united states and certain other nonus investors may also not be subject to these payment and filing obligations nonus investors should consult with their independent advisors as to the above us tax considerations and other us tax consequences of an investment in the company’s stock in light of their particular circumstances 

we may face risks in connection with section 1031 exchanges from time to time we dispose of real properties in transactions intended to qualify as likekind exchanges under section 1031 of the code if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable we may face adverse consequences and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed we may not be able to dispose of real properties on a tax deferred basis 

if essex portfolio lp failed to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes the company could cease to qualify as a reit and suffer other adverse consequences the company believes that its operating partnership essex portfolio lp will continue to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes as a partnership essex portfolio lp is not subject to us federal income tax on its income instead each of its partners is required to pay tax on the partner’s allocable share of the income of essex portfolio lp no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not challenge essex portfolio lp’s status as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the internal revenue service were successful in treating essex portfolio lp as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes the company could fail to meet the income tests andor the asset tests applicable to reits and accordingly cease to qualify as a reit also the failure of essex portfolio lp to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for distribution to its partners

 item 2 properties 

the company’s portfolio as of december 31 2018  including communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures but excluding communities underlying preferred equity investments was comprised of 245  operating apartment communities comprising 59661  apartment homes of which 26695  apartment homes are located in southern california 21146  apartment homes are located in northern california and 11820  apartment homes are located in the seattle metropolitan area the company’s apartment communities accounted for 993  of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  

occupancy rates 

financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total potential rental revenue total potential rental revenue represents the value of all apartment homes with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents when calculating actual rents for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes delinquencies and concessions are not taken into account the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates and the companys calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy as disclosed by other reits market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes the company may increase or decrease these rates based on a variety of factors including overall supply and demand for housing concentration of new apartment deliveries within the same submarket which can cause periodic disruption due to greater rental concessions to increase leasing velocity and rental affordability 

for communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while a community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy 

communities

results of operations 

comparison of year ended december 31 2018  to the year ended december 31 2017   

the company’s average financial occupancies for the company’s stabilized apartment communities or 2018 sameproperty stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  increased 10 basis points to 967  in 2018  from 966  in 2017  financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total potential rental revenue actual rental revenue represents contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total potential rental revenue represents the value of all apartment homes with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant apartment home at its estimated market rate 

market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes the company may increase or decrease these rates based on a variety of factors including overall supply and demand for housing concentration of new apartment deliveries within the same submarket which can cause periodic disruption due to greater rental concessions to increase leasing velocity and rental affordability financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates and the companys calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy disclosed by other reits 

the company does not take into account delinquency and concessions to calculate actual rent for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes the calculation of financial occupancy compares contractual rates for occupied apartment homes to estimated market rents for unoccupied apartment homes and thus the calculation compares the gross value of all apartment homes excluding delinquency and concessions for apartment communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while an apartment community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy 

the regional breakdown of the company’s 2018  sameproperty portfolio for financial occupancy for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  is as follows 



the following table provides a breakdown of revenue amounts including the revenues attributable to 2018  sameproperties 



  

 

2018  sameproperty revenues  increased by 349 million  or 28  to 13 billion  for 2018  compared to 12 billion  in 2017  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 25  in average rental rates from 2177  per apartment home for 2017  to 2231  per apartment home for 2018

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table sets forth the company’s cash flows for 2018  2017  and 2016   in thousands 



essex’s business is operated primarily through the operating partnership essex issues public equity from time to time but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself other than incurring certain expenses from operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the operating partnership essex itself does not hold any indebtedness and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the operating partnership essex’s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock and preferred stock essex’s sole source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the operating partnership 

as of december 31 2018  essex owned a 966  general partner interest and the limited partners owned the remaining 34  interest in the operating partnership 

the liquidity of essex is dependent on the operating partnership’s ability to make sufficient distributions to essex the primary cash requirement of essex is its payment of dividends to its stockholders essex also guarantees some of the operating partnership’s debt as discussed further in notes 7 and 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k if the operating partnership fails to fulfill certain of its debt requirements which trigger essex’s guarantee obligations then essex will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees however essex’s only significant asset is its investment in the operating partnership 

for essex to maintain its qualification as a reit it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding net capital gains while historically essex has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of other property including in limited circumstances essex’s own stock as a result of this distribution requirement the operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not reits can essex may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating partnership’s working capital needs acquisitions and developments 

at december 31 2018  the company had 1345 million  of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and 2095 million  in marketable securities of which 824 million  were equity securities or available for sale debt securities the company believes that cash flows generated by its operations existing cash and cash equivalents marketable securities balances availability under existing lines of credit access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of the company’s reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2019  the timing source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment which can affect the company’s plans for acquisitions dispositions development and redevelopment activities 

as of december 31 2018  the company had 2750 million  of private placement unsecured bonds outstanding at an average interest rate of 45  with maturity dates ranging from december 2019 through august 2021

the company pays quarterly dividends from cash available for distribution until it is distributed cash available for distribution is invested by the company primarily in investment grade securities held available for sale or is used by the company to reduce balances outstanding under its lines of credit 

derivative activity 

the company uses interest rate swaps interest rate caps and total return swap contracts to manage certain interest rate risks the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate swaps and total return swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts or payments and the discounted expected variable cash payments or receipts the variable cash payments or receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 

the company has entered into interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 1750 million  that effectively fixed the interest rate on the 1750 million of the 3500 million unsecured term loan at 23 these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting 

  

the company has four total return swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 2560 million that effectively converts 2560 million of mortgage notes payable to a floating interest rate based on the securities industry and financial markets association municipal swap index sifma plus a spread the total return swaps provide fair market value protection on the mortgage notes payable to our counterparties during the initial period of the total return swap until the companys option to call the mortgage notes at par can be exercised the company can currently call all four of the total return swaps with 2560 million of the outstanding debt at par these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting 

as of december 31 2018  the company also had interest rate caps with an aggregate notional amount of 99 million  that effectively limit the company’s exposure to interest rate risk by providing a ceiling on the variable interest rate for a portion of the company’s tax exempt variable rate debt 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  the aggregate carrying value of the interest rate swap contracts was an asset of 58 million  and 54 million  respectively and is included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and a liability of zero  at each date the aggregate carrying value of the interest rate caps was zero on the balance sheets as of both december 31 2018  and 2017  the aggregate carrying value of the total return swaps was zero as of both december 31 2018  and 2017

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities the company defines critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require the companys management to exercise their most difficult subjective and complex judgments the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates relate principally to the following key areas i accounting for the acquisition of investments in real estate and ii assessing the carrying values of our real estate properties and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates specifically determining the fair value of a real estate property or investment in and advances to a joint venture or affiliate after an indication of impairment is identified involves significant judgment the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 

the company accounts for its acquisitions of investments in real estate by assessing each acquisition to determine if it meets the definition of a business or if it qualifies as an asset acquisition we expect that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions and result in the capitalization of acquisition costs and the allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair value of the respective assets and liabilities 

the relative fair value of the tangible assets which principally includes land and building is determined first by valuing the property as a whole as if it were vacant using stabilized net operating income and market specific capitalization rates the relative fair value of the land and building is then allocated based on its estimated fair value 

in calculating the fair value of identified intangible assets of an acquired property the inplace leases are valued based on inplace rent rates and amortized over the average remaining term of all acquired leases 

the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 

further the company evaluates whether its coinvestments are other than temporarily impaired and if so records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the coinvestments carrying value over its estimated fair value 

the company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 

net operating income 

net operating income noi and sameproperty noi are considered by management to be an important supplemental performance measure to earnings from operations included in the company’s consolidated statements of income the presentation of sameproperty noi assists with the presentation of the company’s operations prior to the allocation of depreciation and any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual communities or groups of communities in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets the company defines sameproperty noi as sameproperty revenue less sameproperty operating expenses including property taxes please see the reconciliation of earnings from operations to sameproperty noi which in the table below is the noi for stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the periods presented  in thousands

the company’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks to accomplish this objective the company uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy as of december 31 2018  the company had entered into five  interest rate swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in the interestrelated cash outflows on 1750 million  of the unsecured term debt as of december 31 2018  the company also had 2696 million  of secured variable rate indebtedness of which 99 million  is subject to interest rate cap protection all of the company’s interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges as of december 31 2018  the following table summarizes the notional amount carrying value and estimated fair value of the company’s cash flow hedge derivative instruments used to hedge interest rates as of december 31 2018  the notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a particular security that is currently hedged at one time but does not represent exposure to credit interest rates or market risks the table also includes a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the impact on the company’s derivative instruments from an increase or decrease in 10year treasury bill interest rates by 50 basis points as of december 31 2018  



additionally the company has entered into total return swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 2560 million  that effectively convert 2560 million  of fixed mortgage notes payable to a floating interest rate based on the sifma plus a spread and have a carrying value of zero at december 31 2018 the company is exposed to insignificant interest rate risk on these swaps as the related mortgages are callable at par by the company coterminus with the termination of any related swap these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting 

interest rate sensitive liabilities 

the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its lines of credit and longterm debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company’s real estate investment portfolio and operations the company’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 

the company’s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows management has estimated that the fair value of the company’s 50 billion  of fixed rate debt at december 31 2018  to be 50 billion  management has estimated the fair value of the company’s 6196 million  of variable rate debt at december 31 2018  to be 6152 million  based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable and variable rate demand notes compared to those available in the marketplace the following table represents scheduled principal payments  in thousands 

  



  

 

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2018  it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result the company’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations and hedging strategies would depend on the exposures that arise prior to settlement

 item 1a risk factors 

for purposes of this section the term “stockholders” means the holders of shares of essex property trust inc’s common stock set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to essex property trust inc’s stockholders and essex portfolio lp’s unitholders you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our company our properties and our business 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual operating results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

risks related to our real estate investments and operations 

general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values  real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks if the communities and other real estate investments do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and the ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders will be adversely affected income from the communities may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

 

as leases at the communities expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to the company income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws including without limitation the americans with disabilities act of 1990 the disabilities act fair housing amendment act of 1988 the fhaa and tax laws real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore the company’s ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be limited 

real estate in our markets can also at times be difficult to sell at prices we find acceptable these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition if we are found to have held acquired or developed a community as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business federal tax laws may limit our ability to sell the community without incurring a 100 tax on the gain on the sale of the community and potentially adversely impacting our status as a real estate investment trust “reit” unless we own the community through one of our taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents and the company may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire   substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less if the company is unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then the company’s results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected with these short term leases our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

national and regional economic environments can negatively impact the company’s liquidity and operating results  the companys forecast for the national economy assumes growth of the gross domestic product of the national economy and the economies of the west coast states in the event of a recession the company could incur reductions in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising and turnover expenses further a recession may 

affect consumer confidence and spending and negatively impact the volume and pricing of real estate transactions which could negatively affect the company’s liquidity and its ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes to the economy 

acquisitions of communities involve various risks and uncertainties and may fail to meet expectations  the company intends to continue to acquire apartment communities however there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet the company’s expectations the company’s estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow the company to market an acquired apartment community as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate in addition following an acquisition the value and operational performance of an apartment community may be diminished if obsolescence or neighborhood changes occur before we are able to redevelop or sell the community also in connection with such acquisitions we may assume unknown liabilities which could ultimately lead to material costs for us the company expects to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or joint ventures or additional equity by the company the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the company’s existing stockholders if the company finances new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless the company obtains substitute financing the company may not be able to undertake additional borrowing for further acquisitions or developments or such borrowing may be not available on advantageous terms 

development and redevelopment activities may be delayed not completed andor not achieve expected results  the company pursues development and redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals which have no assurance of being received andor the timing of which may be delayed from the company’s expectations the company defines development projects as new communities that are being constructed or are newly constructed and are in a phase of leaseup and have not yet reached stabilized operations and redevelopment projects as existing properties owned or recently acquired that have been targeted for additional investment by the company with the expectation of increased financial returns through property improvement as of december 31 2017 the company had five consolidated development projects and two joint venture development projects comprised of 1982 apartment homes for an estimated cost of 13 billion of which 7520 million remains to be expended and 5720 million is the companys share in addition at december 31 2017 the company had ownership interests in five major redevelopment projects aggregating 1727 apartment homes with estimated redevelopment costs of 1388 million of which approximately 436 million remains to be expended 

the company’s development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including among others the following 

 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the essex’s stockholders and the operating partnerships unitholders further the development and redevelopment of communities is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see the risk factor above titled “ general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values ” 

investments in mortgages mezzanine loans subordinated debt other real estate and other marketable securities could adversely affect the company’s cash flow from operations the company may invest in equity preferred equity or debt securities related to real estate andor other investment securities andor cash investments which could adversely affect the company’s ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders including without 

limitation due to a decline in the value of such investments the company may also purchase or otherwise invest in securities issued by entities which own real estate andor invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations such mortgages may be first second or third mortgages and these mortgages andor other investments may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed the company may make or acquire mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity or entities that owns the interest in the entity owning the property in general investments in mortgages include the following risks 

 

if any of the above were to occur it could adversely affect the company’s cash flows from operations 

our apartment communities may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities which could cause us to incur substantial costs the properties that the company owns or may acquire are or may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which the company may have no recourse or only limited recourse against the sellers in general the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements related to the sales of the properties may not survive the closing of the transactions while the company will seek to require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive such indemnification may be limited and subject to various materiality thresholds a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses as a result there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties in addition the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with apartment communities may exceed our expectations and we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the geographic concentration of the company’s communities and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and operating results  the company generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  from the company’s communities concentrated in southern california los angeles orange santa barbara san diego and ventura counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area for the year ended december 31 2017  83  of the company’s rental revenues were generated from communities located in california this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations in general factors that may adversely affect local market and economic conditions include among others the following 

 

because the company’s communities are primarily located in southern california northern california and the seattle metropolitan area the company is exposed to greater economic concentration risks than if it owned a more geographically diverse portfolio the company is susceptible to adverse developments in california and washington economic and regulatory environments such as increases in real estate and other taxes costs of complying with governmental regulations or increased regulation and other factors in addition the state of california is generally regarded as more litigious and more highly regulated and taxed than many states which may reduce demand for the company’s communities and increase costs related to compliance with governmental regulations any adverse developments in the economy or real estate markets in california or washington or any decrease in demand for the company’s communities resulting from the california or washington regulatory or business environments could have an adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company may experience various increased costs including increased property taxes to own and maintain its properties   real property taxes on our properties may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change thus our real estate taxes in the state of washington could increase as a result of property value reassessments or increased property tax rates in that state a current california law commonly referred to as proposition 13 generally limits annual real estate tax increases on california properties to 2 of assessed value however under proposition 13 property tax reassessment generally occurs as a result of a “change in ownership” of a property as specially defined for purposes of those rules because the property taxing authorities may not determine whether there has been a “change in ownership” or the actual reassessed value of a property for a period of time after a transaction has occurred we may not know the impact of a potential reassessment for a considerable amount of time following a particular transaction therefore the amount of property taxes we are required to pay could increase substantially from the property taxes we currently pay or have paid in the past including on a retroactive basis in addition from time to time voters and lawmakers have announced initiatives to repeal or amend proposition 13 to eliminate its application to commercial and industrial property andor introduce split tax roll legislation such initiatives if successful could increase the assessed value andor tax rates applicable to commercial property in california including our apartment communities further changes in us federal tax law including recently enacted us tax legislation the “2017 tax legislation” could cause state and local governments to alter their taxation of real property 

the company may experience increased costs associated with capital improvements and routine property maintenance such as repairs to the foundation exterior walls and rooftops of its properties as its properties advance through their lifecycles in some cases we may spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or maintenance increases in the company’s expenses to own and maintain its properties could adversely impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

competition in the apartment community market and other housing alternatives may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for the company’s communities  there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting tenants these include other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent or for sale in the markets in which the communities are located competitive housing in a particular area and the increasing affordability of owner occupied single and multifamily homes caused by lower housing prices mortgage interest rates and government programs to promote home ownership or create additional rental andor other types of housing could adversely affect the company’s ability to retain its tenants lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents if the demand for the company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing apartment communities rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations the company also faces competition from other companies reits businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities this competition may result in an increase in prices and costs of apartment communities that the company acquires andor develops 

the company’s joint ventures and joint ownership of communities its ownership of properties with shared facilities with a homeowners association or other entity its ownership of properties subject to a ground lease and its preferred equity investments and its other partial interests in entities that own communities could limit the company’s ability to control such communities and may restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in these properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated 

the company has entered into and may continue in the future to enter into joint ventures or partnerships through which it owns an indirect economic interest in less than 100 of the community or land or other investments owned directly by the joint venture or partnership as of december 31 2017  the company had through several joint ventures an interest in 10810 apartment homes in operating communities for a total book value of 7803 million 

joint venture partners often have shared control over the development and operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company’s business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to the company’s instructions or requests or its policies or objectives consequently a joint venture partners’ actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives the company may be unable to take action without its joint venture partners’ approval a joint venture partner might fail to approve decisions that are in the company’s best interest should a joint venture partner become bankrupt the company could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities in some instances the company and the joint venture partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause the company to sell its interest or acquire a partner’s interest at a time when the company otherwise would have not have initiated such a transaction 

from time to time the company through the operating partnership invests in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing financing or managing real property for example the company has made preferred equity investments in third party entities that own real estate and may continue in the future to make such preferred equity or other investments with preferred equity investments and certain other investments the operating partnership’s interest in a particular entity is typically less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership’s objectives the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity the company may also incur losses if any guarantees or indemnifications were made by the company the company also owns properties indirectly under downreit structures the company has and in the future may enter into transactions that could require the company to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets into downreits joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within the company’s control occur although the company plans to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on sale of such assets pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code the company can provide no assurance that the company will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they could have a material impact on its financial position 

also from time to time the company invests in properties which may be subject to certain shared facilities agreements with homeowners associations and other entities andor invests in properties subject to ground leases where a subtenant may have certain similar rights to that of a party under such a shared facilities agreement for such properties the companys ability to control the expenditure of capital improvements and its allocation with such other parties may adversely affect the companys business financial condition and results of operations

these transactions or any other acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties for example as a consequence of such transactions we may assume unknown liabilities which could ultimately lead to material costs for us in addition the integration of acquired businesses or other acquisitions may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business to integrate acquired businesses or other acquisitions we must implement our management information systems operating systems and internal controls and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations the expected synergies from acquisitions may not be fully realized which could result in increased costs or other issues and have an adverse effect on our business there can be no assurance that all preacquisition property due diligence will have identified all material issues that might arise with respect to such acquired business and its properties or as to any such other acquisitions any future acquisitions we make may also require significant additional debt or equity financing which in the case of debt financing would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings and in the case of equity or equitylinked financing could be dilutive to essexs existing stockholders and the operating partnerships unitholders these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in applicable laws or noncompliance with applicable laws could adversely affect the company’s operations or expose us to liability the company must own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop its properties in compliance with numerous federal state and local laws and regulations some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations these laws and regulations may include zoning laws building codes rent control or stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing federal state and local tax laws landlord tenant laws environmental laws employment laws immigration laws and other laws generally applicable to the company’s business and operations noncompliance with laws could expose the company to liability if the company does not comply with all of these requirements it may have to pay fines to government authorities or damage awards to private litigants the company does not know whether these requirements will change or whether new requirements will be imposed changes in or noncompliance with these regulatory requirements could require the company to make significant unanticipated expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

compliance with laws benefiting disabled persons may require the company to make significant unanticipated expenditures or impact the company’s investment strategy  under the disabilities act all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons the fhaa requires that multifamily communities first occupied after march 13 1991 be accessible to handicapped tenants and visitors these and other federal state and local laws and regulations may require modifications to existing buildings or restrict certain renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons and may require other structural features which add to the cost of buildings under construction legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by disabled persons the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial noncompliance with these laws could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures 

the company may not be able to lease its retailcommercial space consistent with its projections or at market rates  the company has retailcommercial space in its portfolio which represents approximately 2 of our total revenue the retailcommercial space at our properties among other things serve as additional amenity for our tenants the long term nature of our retailcommercial leases and characteristics of many of our tenants small local businesses may subject us to certain risks we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or at market rates also when leases for our existing retailcommercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable that the current lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retailcommercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retailcommercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s portfolio may have environmental liabilities  under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we have been from time to time and may be required in the future regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases naturally occurring substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for response costs property damage personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the impacts resulting from such releases while the company is unaware of any such response action required or damage claims associated with its existing properties which individually or in aggregate would have a materially adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations potential future costs and damage claims may be substantial and could exceed any insurance coverage we may have for such events or such coverage may not exist further the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate any such impacts may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the impacted property in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of responding to hazardous or toxic substance or petroleum product releases 

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property the company carries certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk as to its properties however such coverage is not fully available for all properties and as to those properties for which limited coverage is fully available it may not apply to certain claims arising from known conditions present on those properties in general in connection with the ownership direct or indirect operation financing management and development of its communities the company could be considered as the owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances present there and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities the company may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to third persons and damage to their property 

properties which we intend to acquire undergo a preacquisition phase i environmental site assessment which is intended to afford the company protection against socalled “owner liability” under the primary federal environmental law as well as further environmental assessment which may involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling where conditions warranting such further assessment are identified and seller’s consent is obtained while such assessments are conducted in accordance with applicable “all appropriate inquiry standards no assurance can be given that all environmental conditions present on or beneath or emanating from a given property will be discovered or that the full nature and extent of those conditions which are discovered will be adequately ascertained and quantified 

in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor 

beneath or affecting our buildings the company does so pursuant to appropriate environmental regulatory requirements with the objective of obtaining regulatory closure or a no further action determination that will allow for future use development and sale of any impacted community 

certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials acms into the air or exposure to leadbased paint lbp and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of apartment communities for personal injury associated with acms or lbp 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed in a timely manner although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions the company has adopted policies for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold when it is detected and to minimize any impact mold might have on tenants of the property the company believes its mold policies and proactive response to address any known mold existence reduce its risk of loss from these cases however no assurance can be provided that the company has identified and responded to all mold occurrences 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as proposition 65 requiring that clear and reasonable warnings be given to persons who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke although the company has sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements the company cannot assure you that the company will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 65 

methane gas is a naturallyoccurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas particularly in the southern california coastal areas methane is a nontoxic gas but is flammable and can be explosive at sufficient concentrations when in confined spaces and exposed to an ignition source naturallyoccurring methane gas is regulated at the state and federal level as a greenhouse gas but is not otherwise regulated as a hazardous substance however some local governments such as los angeles county require that new buildings constructed in areas designated methane gas zones install detection andor venting systems methane gas is also associated with certain industrial activities such as former municipal waste landfills radon is also a naturallyoccurring gas that is found below the surface and can pose a threat to human health requiring abatement action if present in sufficient concentration within occupied areas the company cannot assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane or radon gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas 

we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental matters will not affect our ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations provided however the company is unaware of any pending or threatened alleged claim resulting from such matters which would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

the company may incur general uninsured losses  the company purchases general liability and property including loss of rent insurance coverage for each of its communities the company may also purchase limited earthquake terrorism environmental and flood insurance for some of its communities however there are types of losses generally catastrophic in nature such as losses due to wars acts of terrorism earthquakes pollution environmental matters or extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes fires and floods that are uninsurable or not economically insurable or may be insured subject to limitations such as large deductibles or copayments insurance risks associated with potential terrorist acts could sharply increase the premiums the company pays for coverage against property and casualty claims the company utilizes a wholly owned insurance subsidiary pacific western insurance llc pwi to selfinsure certain earthquake and property losses for some of the communities in its portfolio as of december 31 2017 pwi has cash and marketable securities of approximately 818 million and is consolidated in the companys financial statements 

all the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity the company evaluates its financial loss exposure to seismic events by using actuarial loss models developed by the insurance industry and in most cases property vulnerability analysis based on structural evaluations of seismic consultants the company manages this exposure where considered appropriate desirable and costeffective by upgrading properties to increase their resistance to forces caused by seismic events by considering available funds and coverages provided by pwi andor in some cases by purchasing seismic insurance purchasing seismic insurance coverage can be costly and such seismic insurance is in limited supply as a result the company may experience a shortage in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of the insurance makes it in managements view not economically practical the company may purchase limited earthquake insurance for certain highdensity properties and in most cases assets owned by the companys coinvestments 

the company carries other types of insurance coverage related to a variety of risks and exposures based on market conditions the company may change or potentially eliminate insurance coverages or increase levels of selfinsurance further we cannot assure you that the company will not incur losses which could be material due to uninsured risks deductibles and selfinsured retentions andor losses in excess of coverage limits 

we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets such as the metropolitan markets in southern california the san francisco bay area and seattle these markets may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our communities both physically and financially or cause losses that exceed our insurance coverage our communities could also directly or indirectly be the location or target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks crimes shootings other acts of violence or other incidents beyond our control the occurrence of which could directly impact the value of our communities through damage destruction loss or increased security costs as well as operational losses due to reduction of traffic and rental demand for our communities and the availability of insurance for such acts may be limited or may be subject to substantial costs if such an incident were to occur at one of our communities we may also be subject to significant liability claims such events and losses could significantly affect our ability to operate those communities and materially impair our ability to achieve our expected results 

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees tenants and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material in the event of a substantial loss insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full replacement cost of the company’s lost investment or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the company’s ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed 

climate change may adversely affect our business to the extent that climate change does occur we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature all of which may result in physical damage or a decrease in demand for our communities located in these areas or affected by these conditions should the impact of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time our financial condition or results of operations would be adversely affected 

in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing communities and could also require us to spend more on our new development communities without a corresponding increase in revenue for example various federal regional and state laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions including the recently updated california energy efficiency standards referred to as title 24 or the energy efficiency standards for residential and nonresidential buildings among other things “green” building codes may seek to reduce emissions through the imposition of standards for design construction materials water and energy usage and efficiency and waste management the imposition of such requirements in the future could increase the costs of maintaining or improving our existing properties or developing properties for example to improve their energy efficiency andor resistance to inclement weather without a corresponding increase in revenue resulting in adverse impacts to our operating results 

accidental death or severe injuries due to fires floods other natural disasters or hazards could adversely affect our business and results of operations  the accidental death or severe injuries of persons living in our communities due to fires floods other natural disasters or hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where any such events have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

adverse changes in laws may adversely affect the companys liabilities andor operating costs relating to its properties and its operations  increases in real estate taxes and income service and transfer taxes cannot always be passed through to tenants or users in the form of higher rents and may adversely affect the companys cash available for distribution and its ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders and pay amounts due on its debt similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability of the company andor its operating costs on a range of issues including those regarding potential liability for other environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions as well as changes in laws affecting development construction and safety requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures including without limitation those related to structural or seismic retrofit or more costly operational safety systems and programs which could have a material adverse effect on the company for example 1 the california statute the sustainable communities and climate protection act of 2009 also known as sb375 provides that in order to reduce greenhouse emissions there should be regional planning to coordinate housing needs with regional transportation and such planning could lead to restrictions on or increases in property 

development that adversely affect the company and 2 the environmental protection agency has implemented a program for longterm phase out of hcfc22 coolant freon by 2030 which could lead to increased capital andor operating costs 

in addition rent control or rent stabilization laws and other regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to increase rents and pass through new or increased operating costs to our tenants for example in richmond and mountain view ca both of which are in the san francisco bay area rent control initiatives were recently passed by the voters these initiatives and any other future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing as well as any lawsuits against the company arising from such rent control or other laws may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs such laws and regulations limit our ability to charge market rents increase rents evict tenants or recover increases in our operating expenses and could make it more difficult for us to dispose of properties in certain circumstances expenses associated with our investment in these communities such as debt service real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from the community furthermore such regulations may negatively impact our ability to attract higherpaying tenants to such communities 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us  we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances including significant cash amounts of our wholly owned insurance subsidiary pwi as well as 401k plan assets in a limited number of financial institutions our cash balances are generally in excess of federally insured limits the failure or collapse of one or more of these financial institutions may materially adversely affect our ability to recover our cash balances or the 401k assets certain financial institutions are lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit the company’s growth  the company may make acquisitions or commence development activity outside of its existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise the company’s historical experience in its existing markets does not ensure that it will be able to operate successfully in new markets the company may be exposed to a variety of risks if it chooses to enter new markets these risks include among others 

 

current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements including estimates related to the fair value of tangible and intangible assets and the carrying value of our real estate investments often these estimates require the use of local market knowledge and data that is difficult to assess as well as estimates of future cash flows associated with our real estate investments that can also be difficult to accurately predict although our management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates it is possible that actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

our business and reputation depend on our ability to continue providing high quality housing and consistent operation of our communities the failure of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our business and reputation depend on providing tenants with quality housing with highly reliable services including with respect to water and electric power along with the consistent operation of our communities including a wide variety of amenities such as covered parking swimming pools clubhouses with fitness facilities playground areas tennis courts and the like public utilities especially those that provide water and electric power are fundamental for the consistent operation of our communities the delayed delivery or any material reduction or prolonged interruption of these services could allow tenants to terminate their leases reduce their rents or result in an increase in costs or other issues in addition we may fail to provide quality housing and continuous access to amenities as a result of other factors including mechanical failure power outage human error vandalism physical or electronic security breaches war terrorism or similar events such service interruptions mechanical failures or other events may also expose us to additional liability claims and damage our reputation and brand and could cause tenants to terminate or not renew their leases or prospective tenants to seek housing elsewhere any such failures could impair our ability to continue providing quality housing and consistent operation of our communities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap factors considered in evaluating impairment of the company’s existing multifamily real estate assets held for investment 

include significant declines in property operating profits recurring property operating losses and other significant adverse changes in general market conditions that are considered permanent in nature generally a multifamily real estate asset held for investment is not considered impaired if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows of the asset over its estimated holding period are in excess of the asset’s net book value at the balance sheet date assumptions used to estimate annual and residual cash flow and the estimated holding period of such assets require the judgment of management there can be no assurance that the company will not take charges in the future related to the impairment of the company’s assets any future impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which may preclude our developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair value of our land holdings which we determine is less that the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment changes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

under certain circumstances assets owned by a subsidiary reit may be required to be disposed of via a sale of capital stock rather than an asset sale   under certain circumstances assets owned by a subsidiary reit may be required to be disposed of via a sale of capital stock rather than as an asset sale by that subsidiary reit which may limit the number of persons willing to acquire indirectly any assets held by that subsidiary reit as a result we may not be able to realize a return on our investment in a joint venture that utilizes a subsidiary reit structure at the time or on the terms we desire 

we may from time to time be subject to litigation which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  we may be a party to various claims and routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business some of these claims or others to which we may be subject from time to time may result in defense costs settlements fines or judgments against us some of which are not or cannot be covered by insurance payment of any such costs settlements fines or judgments that are not insured could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations in addition certain litigation or the resolution of certain litigation may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured or adversely impact our ability to attract officers and directors 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

capital and credit market conditions may affect the company’s access to sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could negatively affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition  in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to the company may be adversely affected our current balance sheet the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a diversified bank group access to the public and private placement debt markets and secured debt financing providers such as fannie mae and freddie mac provides some insulation from volatile capital markets we primarily use external financing including sales of equity securities to fund acquisitions developments and redevelopments and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our acquisition development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income in general to the extent that the company’s access to capital and credit is at a higher cost than the company has experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing without a corresponding change to investment cap rates the company’s ability to make acquisitions develop communities obtain new financing and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates could be adversely affected which would impact the companys financial standing and related credit rating in addition if our ability to obtain financing is adversely affected we may be unable to satisfy scheduled maturities on existing financing through other sources of our liquidity which in the case of secured financings could result in lender foreclosure on the apartment communities securing such debt 

debt financing has inherent risks  at december 31 2017 the company had approximately 57 billion  of indebtedness including 7992 million  of variable rate indebtedness of which 1750 million is subject to an interest rate swap effectively fixing the interest rate on 1750 million in debt 207 million is subject to interest rate cap protection the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including among others the following 



 

the company may not be able to renew repay or refinance its indebtedness when due or may be required to refinance its indebtedness at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if the company is unable to refinance its indebtedness on acceptable terms or not at all the company might be forced to dispose of one or more of its properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses such losses could have an adverse effect on the company and its ability to make distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders and pay amounts due on its debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and the company is unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequential loss of revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet reit distribution requirements 

debt financing of communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service debt and fund distributions  where appropriate the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on the company’s investments and to provide for additional investments that the company could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the communities will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the reit distribution requirements of the code our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations working capital and capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future there is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing indebtedness or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms which in either case could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows to a certain extent our cash flow is subject to general economic industry regional financial competitive operating legislative regulatory taxation and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

as of december 31 2017 the company had 56 consolidated communities encumbered by debt with respect to the 56 communities encumbered by debt all of them are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those communities the holders of this indebtedness will have rights with respect to these communities and if debt payment obligations are not met lenders may seek foreclosure of communities which would reduce the company’s income and net asset value and its ability to service other debt 

compliance requirements of taxexempt financing and below market rent requirements may limit income from certain communities  at december 31 2017 the company had approximately 2702 million  of variable rate taxexempt financing this taxexempt financing provides for certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants the company expects to engage in taxexempt financings in the future if the compliance requirements of the taxexempt financing restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderate income tenants or eligiblequalified tenants then our income from these properties may be limited while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweigh any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed communities if the company is required to lower rental rates to attract tenants who satisfy the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for tenants satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and the company may be subject to additional contractual liability besides the limitations due to taxexempt financing requirements the income from certain communities may be limited due to below market rent bmr requirements imposed by local authorities in connection with the original development of the community 

the indentures governing our notes and other financing arrangements contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility  the indentures that govern our publicly registered notes contain financial and operating covenants that among other things restrict our ability to take specific actions even if we believe them to be in our best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

 

the instruments governing our other unsecured indebtedness require us to meet specified financial covenants including covenants relating to net worth fixed charge coverage debt service coverage the amounts of total indebtedness and secured indebtedness leverage and certain investment limitations these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue 

our business strategies our ability to comply with these provisions and those contained in the indentures governing the notes may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance changes in general business and economic conditions adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting us the breach of any of these covenants including those contained in our indentures could result in a default under our indebtedness which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable if any of our indebtedness is accelerated we may not be able to repay it 

rising interest rates may affect the company’s costs of capital and financing activities and results of operation interest rates could increase which could result in higher interest expense on the company’s variable rate indebtedness or increase interest rates when refinancing maturing fixed rate debt prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company’s ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with positive economic returns on investment and the company’s ability to refinance existing borrowings 

interest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses the company from time to time uses interest rate swaps and interest rate caps contracts to manage certain interest rate risks although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged the company may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the company to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk the company enters into hedging arrangements only with investment grade financial institutions 

a downgrade in the companys investment grade credit rating could materially and adversely affect its business and financial condition the company plans to manage its operations to maintain its investment grade credit rating with a capital structure consistent with its current profile but there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain its current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on the company’s cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on its financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

changes in the company’s financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness  the company’s organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a limit on debt financing consistent with the existing covenants required to maintain the company’s unsecured line of credit bank facility unsecured debt and senior unsecured bonds although pursuant to this policy the company manages its debt to be in compliance with the debt covenants the company may increase the amount of outstanding debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in the company’s ability to service the additional debt accordingly the company could become more leveraged resulting in an increased risk of default of its debt covenants or on its debt obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements any covenant breach or significant increase in the company’s leverage could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

if the company or its subsidiaries defaults on an obligation to repay outstanding indebtedness when due the default could trigger a crossdefault or crossacceleration under other indebtedness  if the company or one of its subsidiaries defaults on its obligations to repay outstanding indebtedness the default could cause a crossdefault or crossacceleration under other indebtedness a default under the agreements governing the company’s or its subsidiaries’ indebtedness including a default under mortgage indebtedness lines of credit bank term loan or the indenture for the company’s outstanding senior notes that is not waived by the required lenders or holders of outstanding notes could trigger crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions under one or more agreements governing the company’s indebtedness which could cause an immediate default or allow the lenders to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable 

the company could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac and by changes in government support for multifamily housing   historically the company has utilized borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future beginning in 2011 the company has primarily utilized unsecured debt and has repaid secured debt at or near their respective maturity and has placed less reliance on agency mortgage debt financing potential options have been proposed for the future of agency mortgage finance in the us that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing more generally it may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect the company and its growth and operations 

risks related to the company in general and the ownership of essex’s stock 

the company depends on its key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed   the company’s success depends on its ability to attract and retain executive officers senior officers and company managers there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of any of the company’s key personnel could have an adverse effect on the company 

the price per share of the company’s stock may fluctuate significantly the market price per share of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including without limitation 

 

many of the factors listed above are beyond the company’s control these factors may cause the market price of shares of the company’s common stock to decline regardless of the company’s financial condition results of operations or business prospects 

the company’s future issuances of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities could be dilutive to current stockholders and adversely affect the market price of the company’s common stock  in order to finance the company’s acquisition and development activities the company has issued and sold common stock preferred stock and convertible debt securities for example during the year ended december 31 2017 the company issued 345444  shares of common stock for 891 million  net of fees and commissions the company may in the future sell further shares of common stock including pursuant to its equity distribution programs with cantor fitzgerald  co barclays capital inc bmo capital markets corp bnp paribas securities corp capital one securities inc citigroup global markets inc jefferies llc jp morgan securities llc mitsubishi ufj securities usa inc and ubs securities llc 

in 2016 the company filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec allowing the company to sell an undetermined number of equity and debt securities as defined in the prospectus future sales of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 

the company’s chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest  the company’s chairman george m marcus is not an employee of the company and is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest mr marcus owns interests in various other real estaterelated businesses and investments he is the chairman of the marcus  millichap company “mmc” which is a parent company of a diversified group of real estate service investment and development firms mr marcus is also the cochairman of marcus  millichap inc “mmi” and mr marcus owns a controlling interest in mmi mmi is a national brokerage firm listed on the nyse that underwent its initial public offering in 2013 

mr marcus has agreed not to divulge any confidential or proprietary information that may be received by him in his capacity as chairman of the company to any of his affiliated companies and that he will absent himself from any and all discussions by the companys board of directors regarding any proposed acquisition andor development of an apartment community where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of his affiliated companies notwithstanding this agreement mr 

marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with the company in acquiring andor developing apartment communities which competition may be detrimental to the company in addition due to such potential competition for real estate investments mr marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with the company which may be detrimental to the interests of the essexs stockholders and the operating partnerships unitholders 

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock as of december 31 2017 george m marcus the chairman of the company’s board of directors wholly or partially owned approximately 17 million shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships indirectly held shares of common stock and assuming exercise of all vested options mr marcus currently does not have majority control over the company however he currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all the company’s stockholders 

under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for certain amendments of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with the company the company’s directors and executive officers including mr marcus have substantial influence on the company consequently their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders 

our related party guidelines may not adequately address all of the issues that may arise with respect to related party transactions  the company has adopted related party transaction approval process guidelines that provide generally that any transaction in which a director or executive officer has an interest must have the prior approval of the audit committee of the companys board of directors the review and approval procedures in these guidelines are intended to determine whether a particular related party transaction is fair reasonable and serves the interests of the companys stockholders pursuant to these guidelines related party transactions have been approved from time to time there is no assurance that this policy will be adequate for determining whether a particular related party transaction is suitable and fair for the company also the policys procedures may not identify and address all the potential issues and conflicts of interests with a related party transaction 

stockholders have limited control over changes in our policies and operations   the company’s board of directors determines our major policies including our policies regarding investments financing growth debt capitalization reit qualification and distributions the company’s board of directors may amend or revise these and other policies without a vote of the stockholders under the company’s charter and the maryland general corporation law stockholders currently have a right to vote only on the following matters 

 

all other matters are subject to the discretion of the company’s board of directors in addition pursuant to maryland law all matters other than the election or removal of a director must be declared advisable by the company’s board of directors prior to a stockholder vote 

our score or rating by proxy advisory firms or other corporate governance consultants advising institutional investors could have an adverse effect on the perception of our corporate governance and thereby negatively impact the market price of our common stock various proxy advisory firms and other corporate governance consultants advising institutional investors provide scores or ratings of our governance measures nominees for election as directors executive compensation practices and other matters that may be submitted to stockholders for consideration at our annual meetings from time to time certain 

matters that we propose for approval may not receive a favorable score or rating or may result in a negative score or rating or recommendation against the nominee or matter proposed these unfavorable scores or ratings may lead to rejected proposals or a loss of stockholder confidence in our corporate governance measures which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we periodically review our corporate governance measures and consider implementing changes that we believe are responsive to concerns that have been raised but there may be times where we decide not to implement changes or other measures recommended by proxy advisors or other corporate governance consultants that we believe are contrary to the best interests of our stockholders notwithstanding the adverse effect this decision may have on our scores or ratings or the perception of our corporate governance thereby negatively impacting the market price of our common stock 

we could face adverse consequences as a result of actions of activist investors campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase shortterm stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring increased debt special dividends stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company responding to stockholder activism or engaging in a process or proxy contest may be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our management team and our employees from executing our business plan which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders   a decrease in rental revenue or liquidity needs such as the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our acquisition and development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to essexs stockholders or the operating partnerships unitholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations  the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

essex may choose to pay dividends in its own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive  we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in essexs stock taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of essexs stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of essexs stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

the maryland business combination act may delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control of the company that might involve a premium price for the companys stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders under the maryland general corporation law certain “business combinations” between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these business combinations include a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities an interested stockholder is defined as any person and certain affiliates of such person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock of the corporation the law also requires a two supermajority stockholder votes for such transactions this means that the transaction must be approved by at least 

 

the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under the maryland general corporation law as permitted by 

the statute the board of directors of the company irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination among the company george m marcus who is the chairman of the company and mmc or any entity owned or controlled by mr marcus and mmc consequently the fiveyear prohibition and supermajority vote requirements described above will not apply to any business combination between the company mr marcus or mmc as a result the company may in the future enter into business combinations with mr marcus and mmc without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland business combination act 

certain provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement charter and bylaws and certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law could delay defer or prevent a change in control while the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on the company’s power to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company’s stock or otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect their interests the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership the company may not without first obtaining the consent of a majority in interest of the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of the company’s general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity such limitations on the company’s power to act may result in the company’s being precluded from taking action that the board of directors otherwise believes is in the best interests of the company or its stockholders 

the company’s charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other terms of such stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock the company may establish one or more classes or series of stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control such a transaction might involve a premium price for the company’s stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock also such a class or series of stock could have dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interests of holders of common stock 

the company’s charter contains provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

the maryland general corporation law restricts the voting rights of holders of shares deemed to be “control shares” under the maryland general corporation law “control shares” are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the company’s stockholders 

the company’s charter and bylaws as well as maryland general corporation law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of the company’s board of directors and that in turn may delay defer or prevent a transaction including a change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the companys stockholders those provisions include among others 

 

rising interest rates could increase interest costs and otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock we are subject to interest rate risk which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock as noted above we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our lines of credit where fluctuations in interest rates may cause our interest expense to rise which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

a breach of the company’s privacy or information security systems or those of our vendors or other third parties could materially adversely affect the company’s business and financial condition  the protection of tenant employee and company data is critically important to the company our business requires us including some of our vendors to use and store personally identifiable and other sensitive information of our tenants and employees the collection and use of personally identifiable information is governed by federal and state laws and regulations privacy and information security laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another compliance with all such laws and regulations may increase the company’s operating costs and adversely impact the company’s ability to market the company’s properties and services 

the security measures put in place by the company and such vendors cannot provide absolute security and the company and our vendors information technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to criminal cyberattacks or data security incidents including ransom of data such as without limitation tenant andor employee information due to employee error malfeasance or other vulnerabilities any such incident could compromise the company’s or such vendors networks or the networks or systems of third parties that facilitate the company’s or such vendors’ business activities and the information stored by the company or such vendors could be accessed misused publicly disclosed corrupted lost or stolen resulting in fraud including wire fraud related to company assets or other harm moreover if a data security incident or breach affects the company’s systems or such vendors systems whether through a breach of the company’s systems or a breach of the systems of third parties or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information the company’s reputation and brand could be materially damaged and the company may be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability including without limitation loss related to the fact that agreements with such vendors or such vendors financial condition may not allow the company to recover all costs related to a cyber breach for which they alone or they and the company should be jointly responsible for which could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

privacy and information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies such as ransomware and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks in light of the increased risks we have dedicated additional company resources to strengthening the security of the company’s computer systems in the future the company may expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company’s information security measures andor to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities despite these steps there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer a significant data security incident in the future that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on the company’s systems or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner any failure in or breach of the companys information security systems those of third party service providers or a breach of other third party systems that ultimately impacts the operational or information security systems of the company as a result of cyberattacks or information security breaches could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business and results of operations further the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data such as phishing and other forms of human engineering are increasing in sophistication and are often novel or change frequently accordingly the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures 

expanding social media vehicles present new risks  the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or information leakage negative posts or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our reputation in addition employees or others might disclose nonpublic sensitive information relating to our business through external media channels the continuing evolution of social media will present us with new challenges and risks 

employee theft or fraud could result in loss certain of our employees have access to or signature authority with respect to bank accounts or other company assets which exposes us to the risk of fraud or theft in addition certain employees have access to key information technology it infrastructure and to tenant and other information that is commercially valuable should any employee compromise our it systems or misappropriate tenant or other information we could incur losses including significant financial or reputational harm from which full recovery cannot be assured we also may not have insurance that covers any losses in full or that covers losses from particular criminal acts as of december 31 2017 potential liabilities for theft or fraud are not quantifiable and an estimate of possible loss cannot be made 

any material weaknesses identified in the companys internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on the company’s stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires the company to evaluate and report on 

its internal control over financial reporting if the company identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting the company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on the company’s stock price 

tax risks 

sales of apartment communities could incur tax risks  if we are found to have held acquired or developed a community primarily with the intent to resell the community federal tax laws may limit our ability to sell the community without incurring a 100 tax on the gain on the sale of the community and potentially adversely impacting our status as a reit unless we own the community through one of our trss 

loss of the companys reit status would have significant adverse consequences to the company and the value of the companys common stock  the company has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code the company’s qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy numerous annual and quarterly requirements including income asset and distribution tests established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 

to qualify under the income test i at least 75 of the company’s annual gross income generally must be derived from rents from real property mortgage interest gain from the sale or other disposition of real property held for investment dividends or other distributions on and gain from the sale or other disposition of shares of other reits and certain other limited categories of income and ii at least 95 of the company’s annual gross income generally must be derived from the preceding sources plus other dividends interest other than mortgage interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock and securities held for investment to qualify under the asset test at the end of each quarter at least 75 of the value of the company’s assets must consist of cash cash items government securities and qualified real estate assets and there are significant additional limitations regarding the company’s investment in securities other than government securities and qualified real estate assets including limitations on the percentage of our assets that can be represented by the company’s trss to comply with the distribution test the company generally must distribute to its stockholders each calendar year at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined before a deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain in addition to the extent the company satisfies the 90 test but distributes less than 100 of its reit taxable income it will be subject to corporate income tax on such undistributed income and could be subject to an additional 4 excise tax because the company needs to meet these tests to maintain its qualification as a reit it could cause the company to have to forego certain business opportunities and potentially require the company to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 

in addition to the income asset and distribution tests described above the company’s qualification as a reit involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company’s control although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enable it to qualify as a reit it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year the company would be subject to us federal income tax on the company’s taxable income at corporate rates and the company would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income the company would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to essex stockholders and operating partnership unitholders and the company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders for the purpose of maintaining reit status as a result of all these factors the company’s failure to qualify as a reit also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value and market price of the company’s common stock 

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on the company or its stockholders  the rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the us department of the treasury changes to the tax laws with or without retroactive legislation could adversely affect the company or its stockholders new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in the company also the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities or an investment in other entities could change making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a reit 

the 2017 tax legislation has significantly changed the us federal income taxation of us businesses and their owners including reits and their stockholders changes made by the 2017 tax legislation that could affect the company and its stockholders include 

 

many of these changes are effective immediately without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions the legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the us department of the treasury and internal revenue service any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation in addition it is unclear how these us federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities because state and local tax laws may adopt some of the basebroadening provisions of the 2017 tax legislation such as the limitation on the deduction for net interest expense while not adopting corresponding rate reductions state and local tax liabilities may increase while some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect the company in one or more reporting periods and prospectively other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis the company continues to work with its tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the recent tax legislation as a whole will have on the company 

the company’s ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries is subject to certain restrictions and it will be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on certain income or deductions if transactions with the company’s taxable reit subsidiaries are not conducted on arm’s length terms  the company has established several trss the trss must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its trss do not adversely affect its reit qualification it cannot provide assurances that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore the company may be subject to a 100 penalty tax to the extent dealings between the company and its trss are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature the company intends that its dealings with its trss will be on an arm’s length basis no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not assert a contrary position 

failure of one or more of the company’s subsidiaries to qualify as a reit could adversely affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit  the company owns interests in multiple subsidiary reits that have elected to be taxed as reits under the code these subsidiary reits are subject to the various reit qualification requirements and other limitations that are applicable to the company if any of the company’s subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit then i the subsidiary reit would become subject to federal income tax and ii the company’s ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit would cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits if any of the company’s subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as reits it is possible that the company could also fail to qualify as a reit 

the tax imposed on reits engaging in “prohibited transactions” may limit the company’s ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes from time to time the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties under the code unless certain exceptions apply any gain resulting from transfers of properties that the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business could be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since the company acquires properties for investment purposes it does not believe that its occasional transfers or disposals of property should be treated as prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by the company are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then the company would be required to pay a 100 

penalty tax on any gain allocable to it from the prohibited transaction and the company’s ability to retain proceeds from real property sales may be jeopardized 

dividends payable by reits may be taxed at higher rates than dividends of nonreit corporations which could reduce the net cash received by stockholders and may be detrimental to the company’s ability to raise additional funds through any future sale of its stock dividends paid by reits to us stockholders that are individuals trusts or estates are generally not eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividends received from nonreit corporations but under the 2017 tax legislation us stockholders that are individuals trusts and estates generally may deduct 20 of ordinary dividends from a reit for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2026 although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by reits such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends this may cause investors to view reit investments as less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock in reits including the companys stock 

nonus investors that invest in the company should be aware of the following us federal income tax considerations in connection with such investment first distributions by the company from its current and accumulated earnings and profits are subject to a 30 us withholding tax in the hands of nonus investors unless the 30 is reduced by an applicable income tax treaty such distributions may also be subject to a 30 withholding tax under the “foreign account tax compliance act” “fatca” unless a nonus investor complies with certain requirements prescribed by fatca second distributions by the company that are attributable to gains from dispositions of us real property “capital gain dividends” will be treated as income that is effectively connected with a us trade or business in the hands of a nonus investor such that a nonus investor will have us federal income tax payment and filing obligations with respect to capital gain dividends furthermore capital gain dividends may be subject to an additional 30 “branch profits tax” which may be reduced by an applicable income tax treaty in the hands of a nonus investor that is a corporation third any gain derived by a nonus investor on a disposition of such investor’s stock in the company will subject such investor to us federal income tax payment and filing requirements unless the company is treated as a domesticallycontrolled reit a reit is “domestically controlled” if less than 50 of the reit’s capital stock by value has been owned directly or indirectly by persons who are not qualifying us persons during a continuous fiveyear period ending on the date of disposition or if shorter during the entire period of the reit’s existence the company believes that it is a domesticallycontrolled reit but no assurances can be given in this regard notwithstanding the foregoing even if the company were not a domesticallycontrolled reit under a special exception nonus investors should not have us federal income tax payment and filing obligations on capital gain dividends or a disposition of their stock in the company if i they did not own more than 10 of such stock at any time during the oneyear period ending on the date of the disposition and ii the company’s stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market located in the united states and certain other nonus investors may also not be subject to these payment and filing obligations nonus investors should consult with their independent advisors as to the above us tax considerations and other us tax consequences of an investment in the company’s stock in light of their particular circumstances 

we may face risks in connection with section 1031 exchanges from time to time we dispose of properties in transactions 

intended to qualify as “likekind exchanges” under section 1031 of the code if a transaction intended to qualify as a section 

1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable we may face adverse consequences and if the laws applicable to such 

transactions are amended or repealed we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis 

if essex portfolio lp failed to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes the company could cease to qualify as a reit and suffer other adverse consequences the company believes that its operating partnership essex portfolio lp will continue to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes as a partnership essex portfolio lp is not subject to us federal income tax on its income instead each of its partners is required to pay tax on the partner’s allocable share of the income of essex portfolio lp no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not challenge essex portfolio lp’s status as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the internal revenue service were successful in treating essex portfolio lp as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes the company could fail to meet the income tests andor the asset tests applicable to reits and accordingly cease to qualify as a reit also the failure of essex portfolio lp to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for distribution to its partners

financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total potential rental revenue total potential rental revenue represents the value of all apartment homes with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents when calculating actual rents for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes delinquencies and concessions are not taken into account the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates and the companys calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy as disclosed by other reits market rates are determined using a variety of factors such as effective rental rates at the property based on recently signed leases and asking rates for comparable properties in the market the recently signed effective rates at the property are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes the company then increases or decreases these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community’s market the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market 

for communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while a community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy

results of operations 

comparison of year ended december 31 2017  to the year ended december 31 2016   

the company’s average financial occupancies for the company’s stabilized apartment communities or “2017 sameproperty” stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  increased 30 basis points to 966  in 2017  from 963  in 2016  financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total potential rental revenue actual rental revenue represents contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total potential rental revenue represents the value of all apartment homes with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant apartment home at its estimated market rate 

market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes the company may increase or decrease these rates based on a variety of factors including overall supply and demand for housing concentration of new apartment deliveries within the same submarket which can cause periodic disruption due to greater rental concessions to increase leasing velocity and rental affordability financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates and the companys calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy disclosed by other reits 

the company does not take into account delinquency and concessions to calculate actual rent for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes the calculation of financial occupancy compares contractual rates for occupied apartment homes to estimated market rents for unoccupied apartment homes and thus the calculation compares the gross value of all apartment homes excluding delinquency and concessions for apartment communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while an apartment community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table sets forth the company’s cash flows for 2017  2016  and 2015   in thousands 



essex’s business is operated primarily through the operating partnership essex issues public equity from time to time but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself other than incurring certain expenses from operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the operating partnership essex itself does not hold any indebtedness and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the operating partnership essex’s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock and preferred stock essex’s sole source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the operating partnership 

as of december 31 2017  essex owned a 967  general partner interest and the limited partners owned the remaining 33  interest in the operating partnership 

the liquidity of essex is dependent on the operating partnership’s ability to make sufficient distributions to essex the primary cash requirement of essex is its payment of dividends to its stockholders essex also guarantees some of the operating partnership’s debt as discussed further in notes 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k if the operating partnership fails to fulfill certain of its debt requirements which trigger the essex’s guarantee obligations then essex will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees however essex’s only significant asset is its investment in the operating partnership 

for essex to maintain its qualification as a reit it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding net capital gains while historically essex has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of other property including in limited circumstances essex’s own stock as a result of this distribution requirement the operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not reits can essex may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating p artnership’s working capital needs acquisitions and developments 

at december 31 2017  the company had 446 million  of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and 1900 million  in marketable securities of which 805 million  were held available for sale the company believes that cash flows generated by its operations existing cash and cash equivalents marketable securities balances availability under existing lines of credit access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of the company’s reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2018  the timing source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment which can affect the company’s plans for acquisitions dispositions development and redevelopment activities

derivative activity 

the company uses interest rate swaps interest rate caps and total return swap contracts to manage certain interest rate risks the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate swaps and total return swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts or payments and the discounted expected variable cash payments or receipts the variable cash payments or receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements

as of december 31 2017  the company also had three interest rate caps with an aggregate notional amount of 207 million  that effectively limit the company’s exposure to interest rate risk by providing a ceiling on the underlying variable interest rate for a portion of the company’s tax exempt variable rate debt one interest rate cap with a notional balance of 108 million matured on january 1 2018 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the aggregate carrying value of the interest rate swap contracts was an asset of 54 million  and 44 million  respectively and is included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and a liability of zero  and 003 million  respectively the aggregate carrying value of the interest rate caps was zero on the balance sheets as of both december 31 2017  and 2016  the aggregate carrying value of the total return swaps was zero as of both december 31 2017  and 2016

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table summarizes our obligations at december 31 2017   in thousands 



 

variable interest entities 

in accordance with accounting standards for consolidation of variable interest entities vies the company consolidates the operating partnership 16  downreit limited partnerships comprising eight  communities and eight  coinvestments the company consolidates these entities because it is deemed the primary beneficiary the company has no assets or liabilities other than its investment in the operating partnership the consolidated total assets and liabilities related to the eight  consolidated coinvestments and 16  downreit limited partnerships net of intercompany eliminations were approximately 8377 million  and 2655 million  respectively as of december 31 2017  and 7461 million  and 2213 million  respectively as of december 31 2016  noncontrolling interests in these entities were 667 million  and 454 million  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively the companys financial risk in each vie is limited to its equity investment in the vie as of december 31 2017  the company did not have any other vies of which it was deemed to be the primary beneficiary and did not have any vies of which it was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities the company defines critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require the companys management to exercise their most difficult subjective and complex judgments the company’s critical accounting policies and estimates relate principally to the following key areas i accounting for business combinations ii consolidation under applicable accounting standards for entities that are not wholly owned iii assessing the carrying values of our real estate properties and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates and iv internal cost capitalization the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 

the company accounts for its business combinations including the merger and other acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with accounting standards codification asc 80510 business combinations which requires the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities to be recorded at fair value with excess purchase price if any recorded to goodwill the company must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired and consideration transferred the use of different assumptions in estimating the fair value could affect the measurement and timing of recognition of acquired assets and liabilities and related expenses 

the consideration transferred in a business combination is generally measured at fair value for debt assumed by the company the fair value is determined using estimated market interest rates for debt with comparable terms in place at the time of the acquisition for equity issued by the company the fair value is generally based on the fair value of the company’s equity interests at the date of issuance 

the fair value of the tangible assets which principally includes land and building is determined first by valuing the property as a whole as if it were vacant using stabilized net operating income and market specific capitalization rates the fair value of the land and building is then recorded based on its estimated fair value 

in calculating the fair value of identified intangible assets of an acquired property the inplace leases are valued based on inplace rent rates and amortized over the average remaining term of all acquired leases 

the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie if such an entity is a vie then the company performs an analysis to determine who is the primary beneficiary if the company is the primary beneficiary then the entity is consolidated the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 

the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 

further the company evaluates whether its coinvestments are other than temporarily impaired and if so records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the coinvestments carrying value over its estimated fair value 

the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs including interest and real estate taxes incurred during development and redevelopment activities interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period included in capitalized costs are management’s accounting estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with the companys development and redevelopment activities indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development including accounting legal fees and various corporate and community onsite costs that clearly relate to projects under development 

the company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 

net operating income 

net operating income “noi” and sameproperty noi are considered by management to be an important supplemental performance measure to earnings from operations included in the company’s consolidated statements of income the presentation of sameproperty noi assists with the presentation of the company’s operations prior to the allocation of depreciation and any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual communities or groups of communities in addition because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets the company defines sameproperty noi as sameproperty revenue less sameproperty operating expenses including property taxes please see the reconciliation of earnings from operations to sameproperty noi which in the table below is the noi for stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the periods presented  in thousands

additionally the company has entered into total return swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 2566 million  that effectively convert 2566 million  of fixed mortgage notes payable to a floating interest rate based on the sifma plus a spread and have a carrying value of zero at december 31 2017 the company is exposed to insignificant interest rate risk on these swaps as the related mortgages are callable at par by the company coterminus with the termination of any related swap these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting 

interest rate sensitive liabilities 

the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its lines of credit and longterm debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company’s real estate investment portfolio and operations the company’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 

the company’s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows management has estimated that the fair value of the company’s 49 billion  of fixed rate debt including premiums discounts and debt financing costs at december 31 2017  to be 50 billion  management has estimated the fair value of the company’s 7929 million  of variable rate debt net of debt financing costs at december 31 2017  to be 7939 million  based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable and variable rate demand notes compared to those available in the marketplace the following table represents scheduled principal payments  in thousands 

  



  

 

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2017  it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result the company’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations and hedging strategies would depend on the exposures that arise prior to settlement

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily homes if the demand for the company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing housing rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations

 item 1a risk factors 

for purposes of this section the term “stockholders” means the holders of shares of essex property trust inc’s common stock and preferred stock set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to essex property trust inc’s stockholders and essex portfolio lp’s unit holders you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our company our properties and our business 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual operating results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

risks related to our real estate investments and operations 

general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values  real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks if the communities and other real estate investments do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected income from the communities may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

 

as leases at the communities expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to the company income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws eg the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and tax laws real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore the company’s ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited 

real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition if we are found to have held acquired or developed a community primarily with the intent to resell the community federal tax laws may limit our ability to sell the community without incurring a 100 tax on the gain on the sale of the community and potentially adversely impacting our status as a real estate investment trust “reit” unless we own the community through one of our taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents and the company may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire   substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less if the company is unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then the company’s results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected with these short term leases our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

national and regional economic environments can negatively impact the company’s operating results  the companys forecast for the national economy assumes growth of the gross domestic product of the national economy and the economies of the west coast states in the event of a recession the company could incur reductions in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising and turnover expenses 

inflationdeflation may affect rental rates and operating expenses  substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates andor property operating expenses 

acquisitions of communities involve various risks and uncertainties and may fail to meet expectations  the company intends to continue to acquire apartment communities however there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet the company’s expectations the company’s estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow the company to market an acquired apartment community as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate also in connection with such acquisitions we may assume unknown liabilities which could ultimately lead to material costs for us the company expects to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by the company the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the company’s existing stockholders if the company finances new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless the company obtains substitute financing the company may not be able to undertake additional borrowing for further acquisitions or developments or such borrowing may be not available on advantageous terms 

development and redevelopment activities may be delayed not completed andor not achieve expected results  the company pursues development and redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals which have no assurance of being received the company’s development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including among others the following 

 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the company’s stockholders further the development and redevelopment of communities is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see the risk factor above titled “ general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values ” 

investments in mortgages and other real estate and other marketable securities could adversely affect the company’s cash flow from operations the company may invest in equity preferred equity or debt securities related to real estate andor other investment securities andor cash investments which could adversely affect the company’s ability to make distributions to stockholders including without limitation due to a decline in the value of such investments the company may also purchase or otherwise invest in securities issued by entities which own real estate andor invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations such mortgages may be first second or third mortgages and these mortgages andor other investments may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed the company may acquire mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity or entities that owns the interest in the entity owning the property in general investments in mortgages include the following risks 

 

if any of the above were to occur it could adversely affect the company’s cash flows from operations 

our apartment communities may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities which could cause us to incur substantial costs the properties that the company owns or may acquire are or may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which the company may have no recourse or only limited recourse against the sellers in general the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements related to the sales of the properties may not survive the closing of the transactions while the company will seek to require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive such indemnification may be limited and subject to various materiality thresholds a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses as a result there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties in addition the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with apartment communities may exceed our expectations and we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the geographic concentration of the company’s communities and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and operating results  the company generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  from the company’s communities concentrated in southern california los angeles orange santa barbara san diego and ventura counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area for the year ended december 31 2016  83  of the company’s rental revenues were generated from communities located in california this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations in general factors that may adversely affect local market and economic conditions include among others the following 

 

the company may experience various increased costs including increased property taxes to own and maintain its properties   real property taxes on our properties may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change thus our real estate taxes in the state of washington could increase as a result of property value reassessments or increased property tax rates in that state a current california law commonly referred to as proposition 13 generally limits annual real estate tax increases on california properties to 2 of assessed value however under proposition 13 property tax reassessment generally occurs as a result of a “change in ownership” of a property as specially defined for purposes of those rules because the property taxing authorities may not determine whether there has been a “change in ownership” or the actual reassessed value of a property for a period of time after a transaction has occurred we may not know the impact of a potential reassessment for a considerable amount of time following a particular transaction therefore the amount of property taxes we are required to pay could increase substantially from the property taxes we currently pay or have paid in the past including on a retroactive basis in addition from time to time voters and lawmakers have announced initiatives to repeal or amend proposition 13 to eliminate its application to commercial and industrial property andor introduce split tax roll legislation such initiatives if successful could increase the assessed value andor tax rates applicable to commercial property in california including our apartment communities 

the company may experience increased costs associated with capital improvements and routine property maintenance such as repairs to the foundation exterior walls and rooftops of its properties as its properties advance through their lifecycles increases in the company’s expenses to own and maintain its properties could adversely impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

competition in the apartment community market and other housing alternatives may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for the company’s communities  there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent or for sale in the markets in which the communities are located competitive housing in a particular area and the increasing affordability of owner occupied single and multifamily homes caused by lower housing prices mortgage interest rates and government programs to promote home ownership or create additional rental andor other types of housing could adversely affect the company’s ability to retain its residents lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents if the demand for the company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing apartment communities rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations the company also faces competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the 

acquisition development and operation of apartment communities this competition may result in an increase in prices and costs of apartment communities that the company acquires andor develops 

the company’s joint ventures and joint ownership of communities its ownership of properties with shared facilities with a home owners association or other entity its ownership of properties subject to a ground lease and its preferred equity investments and its other partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships that own communities could limit the company’s ability to control such communities and may restrict our ability to finance sell or otherwise transfer our interests in these properties and expose us to loss of the properties if such agreements are breached by us or terminated 

the company defines development projects as new communities that are being constructed or are newly constructed and are in a phase of leaseup and have not yet reached stabilized operations as of december 31 2016  the company had two consolidated development projects and four joint venture development projects comprised of 2223  apartment homes for an estimated cost of 13 billion  of which 07 billion  remains to be expended and 05 billion  is the companys share in addition as of december 31 2016 the company had an interest in 11274 apartment homes in operating communities with joint ventures for a total book value of 08 billion 

joint venture partners often have shared control over the development and operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company’s business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to the company’s instructions or requests or its policies or objectives consequently a joint venture partners’ actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives the company may be unable to take action without its joint venture partners’ approval a joint venture partner might fail to approve decisions that are in the company’s best interest should a joint venture partner become bankrupt the company could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities in some instances the company and the joint venture partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause the company to sell its interest or acquire a partner’s interest at a time when the company otherwise would have not have initiated such a transaction 

from time to time the company through the operating partnership invests in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing financing or managing real property for example the company has made preferred equity investments in third party entities that own real estate with preferred equity investments and certain other investments the operating partnership’s interest in a particular entity is typically less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership’s objectives the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity the company may also incur losses if any guarantees or indemnifications were made by the company the company also owns properties indirectly under downreit structures the company has and in the future may enter into transactions that could require the company to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets into downreits joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within the company’s control occur although the company plans to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on sale pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the code the company can provide no assurance that the company will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they could have a material impact on its financial position 

also from time to time the company invests in properties which may be subject to certain shared facilities agreements with homeowners associations and other entities andor invests in properties subject to ground leases where a subtenant may have certain similar rights to that of a party under such a shared facilities agreement for such properties the companys ability to control the expenditure of capital improvements and its allocation with such other parties may adversely affect the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

we may pursue acquisitions of other reits and real estate companies which could adversely affect our results of operations we may make acquisitions of and investments in other reits and real estate companies that offer properties and communities to augment our market coverage or enhance our property offerings we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition investment alliance or joint venture opportunities that we will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us or that such transactions or relationships will be successful in addition our original estimates and 

assumptions used in assessing any acquisition may be inaccurate and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such acquisition 

these transactions or any other acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties for example as a consequence of such transactions we may assume unknown liabilities which could ultimately lead to material costs for us in addition the integration of acquired businesses or other acquisitions may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business to integrate acquired businesses or other acquisitions we must implement our management information systems operating systems and internal controls and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations there can be no assurance that all preacquisition property due diligence will have identified all material issues that might arise with respect to such acquired business and its properties or as to any such other acquisitions any future acquisitions we make may also require significant additional debt or equity financing which in the case of debt financing would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings and in the case of equity or equitylinked financing could be dilutive to our existing stockholders these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

compliance with laws benefiting disabled persons may require the company to make significant unanticipated expenditures or impact the company’s investment strategy  a number of federal state and local laws including the americans with disabilities act and regulations exist that may require modifications to existing buildings or restrict certain renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons and may require other structural features which add to the cost of buildings under construction legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by disabled persons the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial noncompliance with these laws could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures 

the company may not be able to lease its retailcommercial space consistent with its projections or at market rates  the company has retailcommercial space in its portfolio the retailcommercial space at our properties among other things serve as additional amenity for our residents the long term nature of our retailcommercial leases and characteristics of many of our tenants small local businesses may subject us to certain risks we may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or at market rates also when leases for our existing retailcommercial space expire the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants may be less favorable that the current lease terms our properties compete with other properties with retailcommercial space the presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain if our retailcommercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition the revenue from our retailcommercial space represents approximately 2 of our total rental revenue 

the company’s portfolio may have environmental liabilities  under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we have been from time to time and may be required in the future regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases naturally occurring substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for response costs property damage personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the impacts resulting from such releases while the company is unaware of any such response action required or damage claims associated with its existing properties which individually or in aggregate would have a materially adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations potential future costs and damage claims may be substantial and could exceed any insurance coverage we may have for such events or such coverage may not exist further the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate any such impacts may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the impacted property in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of responding to hazardous or toxic substance or petroleum product releases 

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property the company carries certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk as to its properties however such coverage is not fully available for all properties and as to those properties for which limited coverage is fully available it may not apply to certain claims arising from known conditions present on those properties in general in connection with the ownership direct or indirect operation financing management and development of its communities the company could be considered as the owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances 

present there and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities the company may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to third persons and damage to their property 

properties which we intend to acquire undergo a preacquisition phase i environmental site assessment which is intended to afford the company protection against socalled “owner liability” under the primary federal environmental law as well as further environmental assessment which may involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling where conditions warranting such further assessment are identified and seller’s consent is obtained while such assessments are conducted in accordance with applicable “all appropriate inquiry standards no assurance can be given that all environmental conditions present on or beneath or emanating from a given property will be discovered or that the full nature and extent of those conditions which are discovered will be adequately ascertained and quantified 

in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings the company does so pursuant to appropriate environmental regulatory requirements with the objective of obtaining regulatory closure or a no further action determination that will allow for future use development and sale of any impacted community 

certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials acms into the air or exposure to leadbased paint lbp and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of apartment communities for personal injury associated with acms or lbp 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed in a timely manner although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions the company has adopted policies for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold when it is detected and to minimize any impact mold might have on residents of the property the company believes its mold policies and proactive response to address any known mold existence reduce its risk of loss from these cases however no assurance can be provided that the company has identified and responded to all mold occurrences 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as proposition 65 requiring that clear and reasonable warnings be given to persons who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke although the company has sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements the company cannot assure you that the company will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 65 

methane gas is a naturallyoccurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas particularly in the southern california coastal areas methane is a nontoxic gas but is flammable and can be explosive at sufficient concentrations when in confined spaces and exposed to an ignition source naturallyoccurring methane gas is regulated at the state and federal level as a greenhouse gas but is not otherwise regulated as a hazardous substance however some local governments such as los angeles county require that new buildings constructed in areas designated methane gas zones install detection andor venting systems methane gas is also associated with certain industrial activities such as former municipal waste landfills radon is also a naturallyoccurring gas that is found below the surface and can pose a threat to human health requiring abatement action if present in sufficient concentration within occupied areas the company cannot assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane or radon gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas

the company may incur general uninsured losses  the company purchases general liability and property including loss of rent insurance coverage for each of its communities the company also purchases limited earthquake terrorism environmental and flood insurance there are certain types of losses which may not be covered or could exceed coverage limits the insurance programs are subject to deductibles and selfinsured retentions in varying amounts the company utilizes a wholly owned insurance subsidiary pacific western insurance llc pwi to selfinsure certain earthquake and property 

losses as of december 31 2016 pwi has cash and marketable securities of approximately 699 million and is consolidated in the companys financial statements 

all the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity the company evaluates its financial loss exposure to seismic events by using actuarial loss models developed by the insurance industry and property vulnerability based on structural evaluations of seismic consultants the company manages this exposure where considered appropriate desirable and costeffective by upgrading properties to increase their resistance to forces caused by seismic events by considering available funds and coverages provided by pwi andor by purchasing seismic insurance purchasing seismic insurance coverage can be costly and such seismic insurance is in limited supply as a result the company may experience a shortage in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of the insurance makes it in managements view not economically practical the company purchases limited earthquake insurance for certain highdensity properties and assets owned by the companys coinvestments 

the company carries other types of insurance coverage related to a variety of risks and exposures based on market conditions the company may change or potentially eliminate insurance coverages or increase levels of selfinsurance further we cannot assure you that the company will not incur losses which could be material due to uninsured risks deductibles and selfinsured retentions andor losses in excess of coverage limits 

we have significant investments in large metropolitan markets such as the metropolitan markets in southern california the san francisco bay area and seattle these markets may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks future terrorist attacks in these markets could directly or indirectly damage our communities both physically and financially or cause losses that exceed our insurance coverage 

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material in the event of a substantial loss insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full replacement cost of the company’s lost investment or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the company’s ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed 

accidental death or severe injuries due to fire natural disasters or other hazards could adversely affect our business and results of operations  the accidental death or severe injuries of persons living in our communities due to fire natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where any such events have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

adverse changes in laws may adversely affect the companys liabilities andor operating costs relating to its properties and its operations  increases in real estate taxes and income service and transfer taxes cannot always be passed through to residents or users in the form of higher rents and may adversely affect the companys cash available for distribution and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders and pay amounts due on its debt similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability of the company andor its operating costs on a range of issues including those regarding potential liability for other environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions as well as changes in laws affecting development construction and safety requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures including without limitation those related to structural or seismic retrofit or more costly operational safety systems and programs which could have a material adverse effect on the company for example 1 the california statute the sustainable communities and climate protection act of 2009 also known as sb375 provides that in order to reduce greenhouse emissions there should be regional planning to coordinate housing needs with regional transportation and such planning could lead to restrictions on or increases in property development that adversely affect the company and 2 the environmental protection agency has implemented a program for longterm phase out of hcfc22 coolant freon by 2030 which could lead to increased capital andor operating costs in addition in richmond and mountain view california both of which are in the san francisco bay area rent control initiatives were recently passed by the voters these initiatives and any other future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing as well as any lawsuits against the company arising from such rent control or other laws may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs 

the soundness of financial institutions could adversely affect us  we maintain cash and cash equivalent balances including significant cash amounts of our wholly owned insurance subsidiary pacific western insurance llc as well as 401k plan assets in a limited number of financial institutions our cash balances are generally in excess of federally insured limits the 

failure or collapse of one or more of these financial institutions may materially adversely affect our ability to recover our cash balances or the 401k assets certain financial institutions are lenders under our credit facilities and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry in the event that the volatility of the financial markets adversely affects these financial institutions or counterparties we or other parties to the transactions with us may be unable to complete transactions as intended which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

failure to succeed in new markets may limit the company’s growth  the company may make acquisitions or commence development activity outside of its existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise the company’s historical experience in its existing markets does not ensure that it will be able to operate successfully in new markets the company may be exposed to a variety of risks if it chooses to enter new markets these risks include among others 

 

the company’s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap factors considered in evaluating impairment of the company’s existing multifamily real estate assets held for investment include significant declines in property operating profits recurring property operating losses and other significant adverse changes in general market conditions that are considered permanent in nature generally a multifamily real estate asset held for investment is not considered impaired if the undiscounted estimated future cash flows of the asset over its estimated holding period are in excess of the asset’s net book value at the balance sheet date assumptions used to estimate annual and residual cash flow and the estimated holding period of such assets require the judgment of management there can be no assurance that the company will not take charges in the future related to the impairment of the company’s assets any future impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

we face risks associated with land holdings and related activities we hold land for future development and may in the future acquire additional land holdings the risks inherent in purchasing owning and developing land increase as demand for apartments or rental rates decrease real estate markets are highly uncertain and as a result the value of undeveloped land may fluctuate significantly in addition carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or reduced profitability as a result we hold certain land and may in the future acquire additional land in our development pipeline at a cost we may not be able to fully recover or at a cost which may preclude our developing a profitable multifamily community if there are subsequent changes in the fair value of our land holdings which we determine is less that the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment changes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

capital and credit market conditions may affect the company’s access to sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could negatively affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition  in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to the company may be adversely affected our current balance sheet the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a diversified bank group access to the public and private placement debt markets and secured debt financing providers such as fannie mae and freddie mac provides some insulation from volatile capital markets we primarily use external financing including sales of equity securities to fund acquisitions developments and redevelopments and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our acquisition development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income in general to the extent that the company’s access to capital and credit is at a higher cost than the company has experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing without a corresponding change to investment cap rates the company’s ability to make acquisitions develop communities obtain new financing and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates could be adversely affected which would impact the companys financial standing and related credit rating in addition if our ability to obtain financing is adversely affected we may be unable to satisfy scheduled maturities on existing financing through other sources of our liquidity which in the case of secured financings could result in lender foreclosure on the apartment communities securing such debt 

the company could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac and by changes in government support for multifamily housing   historically the company has utilized borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac there 

are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future beginning in 2011 the company has primarily utilized unsecured debt and has repaid secured debt at or near their respective maturity and has placed less reliance on agency mortgage debt financing potential options have been proposed for the future of agency mortgage finance in the us that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government or if there is reduced government support for multifamily housing more generally it may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect the company and its growth and operations 

debt financing has inherent risks  at december 31 2016 the company had approximately 56 billion  of indebtedness including 5067 million  of variable rate indebtedness of which 250 million is subject to an interest rate swap effectively fixing the interest rate on 250 million in debt the company has also entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount of 1500 million with settlement payments starting in march 2017 207 million is subject to interest rate cap protection the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including among others the following 

 

the company may not be able to renew repay or refinance its indebtedness when due or may be required to refinance its indebtedness at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if the company is unable to refinance its indebtedness on acceptable terms or not at all the company might be forced to dispose of one or more of its properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses such losses could have an adverse effect on the company and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders and pay amounts due on its debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and the company is unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequential loss of revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet reit distribution requirements 

debt financing of communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service debt and fund distributions  where appropriate the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on the company’s investments and to provide for additional investments that the company could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the communities will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations working capital and capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent our cash flow is subject to general economic industry regional financial competitive operating legislative regulatory taxation and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

as of december 31 2016 the company had 61 consolidated communities encumbered by debt with respect to the 61 communities encumbered by debt all of them are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those communities the holders of this indebtedness will have rights with respect to these communities and if debt payment obligations are not met lenders may seek foreclosure of communities which would reduce the company’s income and net asset value and its ability to service other debt 

compliance requirements of taxexempt financing and below market rent requirements may limit income from certain communities  at december 31 2016 the company had approximately 2817 million  of variable rate taxexempt financing this taxexempt financing provides for certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants the company expects to engage in taxexempt financings in the future if the compliance requirements of the taxexempt financing restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to low or moderate income residents or eligiblequalified residents then our income from these properties may be limited while we generally believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with taxexempt bonds more than outweigh any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions this may not always be the case some of these requirements are complex and our failure to comply with them may subject us to material fines or liabilities certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed communities if the company is required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and the company may be subject to additional contractual liability besides the limitations due to taxexempt financing requirements the income 

from certain communities may be limited due to below market rent bmr requirements imposed by local authorities in connection with the original development of the community 

the indentures governing our notes and other financing arrangements contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility  the indentures that govern our publicly registered notes contain financial and operating covenants that among other things restrict our ability to take specific actions even if we believe them to be in our best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

 

the instruments governing our other unsecured indebtedness require us to meet specified financial covenants including covenants relating to net worth fixed charge coverage debt service coverage the amounts of total indebtedness and secured indebtedness leverage and certain investment limitations these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies our ability to comply with these provisions and those contained in the indentures governing the notes may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance changes in general business and economic conditions adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting us the breach of any of these covenants including those contained in our indentures could result in a default under our indebtedness which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable if any of our indebtedness is accelerated we may not be able to repay it 

rising interest rates may affect the company’s costs of capital and financing activities and results of operation interest rates could increase which could result in higher interest expense on the company’s variable rate indebtedness or increase interest rates when refinancing maturing fixed rate debt prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company’s ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with positive economic returns on investment and the company’s ability to refinance existing borrowings 

interest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses the company from time to time uses interest rate swaps and interest rate caps contracts to manage certain interest rate risks although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged the company may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the company to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk the company enters into hedging arrangements only with investment grade financial institutions 

a downgrade in the companys investment grade credit rating could materially and adversely affect its business and financial condition the company plans to manage its operations to maintain its investment grade credit rating with a capital structure consistent with its current profile but there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain its current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on the company’s cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on its financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

changes in the company’s financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness  the company’s organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a limit on debt financing consistent with the existing covenants required to maintain the company’s unsecured line of credit bank facility unsecured debt and senior unsecured bonds although pursuant to this policy the company manages its debt to be in compliance with the debt covenants the company may increase the amount of outstanding debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in the company’s ability to service the additional debt accordingly the company could become more leveraged resulting in an increased risk of default of its debt covenants or on its debt obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements any covenant breach or significant increase in the company’s leverage could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

if the company or its subsidiaries defaults on an obligation to repay outstanding indebtedness when due the default could trigger a crossdefault or crossacceleration under other indebtedness  if the company or one of its subsidiaries defaults on its obligations to repay outstanding indebtedness the default could cause a crossdefault or crossacceleration under other indebtedness a default under the agreements governing the company’s or its subsidiaries’ indebtedness including a default under mortgage indebtedness lines of credit bank term loan or the indenture for the company’s outstanding senior notes that is not waived by the required lenders or holders of outstanding notes could trigger crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions under one or more agreements governing the company’s indebtedness which could cause an immediate default or allow the lenders to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable

the price per share of the company’s stock may fluctuate significantly the market price per share of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including without limitation 

 

many of the factors listed above are beyond the company’s control these factors may cause the market price of shares of the company’s common stock to decline regardless of the company’s financial condition results of operations or business prospects 

the company’s future issuances of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities could be dilutive to current stockholders and adversely affect the market price of the company’s common stock  in order to finance the company’s acquisition and development activities the company has issued and sold common stock preferred stock and convertible debt securities for example during the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 the company issued zero  and 15 million  shares of common stock for zero  and 3323 million  net of fees and commissions respectively the company may in the future sell further shares of common stock including pursuant to its equity distribution programs with cantor fitzgerald  co barclays capital inc bmo capital markets corp bnp paribas securities corp capital one securities inc citigroup global markets inc jefferies llc jp morgan securities llc mitsubishi ufj securities usa inc and ubs securities llc 

in 2016 the company filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec allowing the company to sell an undetermined number of equity and debt securities as defined in the prospectus future sales of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 

the company’s chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest  the company’s chairman george m marcus is not an employee of the company and is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest mr marcus owns interests in various other real estaterelated businesses and investments he is the chairman of the marcus  millichap company “mmc” which is a parent company of a diversified group of real estate service investment and development firms mr marcus is also the cochairman of marcus  millichap inc “mmi” and mr marcus owns a controlling interest in mmi mmi is a national brokerage firm listed on the nyse that underwent its initial public offering in 2013 

mr marcus has agreed not to divulge any confidential or proprietary information that may be received by him in his capacity as chairman of the company to any of his affiliated companies and that he will absent himself from any and all discussions by the companys board of directors regarding any proposed acquisition andor development of an apartment community where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of his affiliated companies notwithstanding this agreement mr 

marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with the company in acquiring andor developing apartment communities which competition may be detrimental to the company in addition due to such potential competition for real estate investments mr marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with the company which may be detrimental to the interests of the company’s stockholders 

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock as of december 31 2016 george m marcus the chairman of the company’s board of directors wholly or partially owned approximately 16 million shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships indirectly held shares of common stock and assuming exercise of all vested options mr marcus currently does not have majority control over the company however he currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all the company’s stockholders 

under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for certain amendments of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with the company the company’s directors and executive officers including mr marcus have substantial influence on the company consequently their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders 

our related party guidelines may not adequately address all of the issues that may arise with respect to related party transactions  the company has adopted related party transaction approval process guidelines that provide generally that any transaction in which a director or executive officer has an interest must have the prior approval of the audit committee of the companys board of directors the review and approval procedures in these guidelines are intended to determine whether a particular related party transaction is fair reasonable and serves the interests of the companys stockholders pursuant to these guidelines related party transactions have been approved from time to time there is no assurance that this policy will be adequate for determining whether a particular related party transaction is suitable and fair for the company also the policys procedures may not identify and address all the potential issues and conflicts of interests with a related party transaction 

failure to generate sufficient revenue or other liquidity needs could limit cash flow available for distributions to stockholders   a decrease in rental revenue or liquidity needs such as the repayment of indebtedness or funding of our acquisition and development activities could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders significant expenditures associated with each community such as debt service payments if any real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a community 

the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by economic and other considerations  the form timing andor amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on actual cash from operations our financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and other factors as the board of directors may consider relevant the board of directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time 

we may choose to pay dividends in our own stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive  we may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes as a result a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received if a us stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale furthermore with respect to nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock in addition the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends 

the maryland business combination act may delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control of the company that might involve a premium price for the companys stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders under the maryland general corporation law certain “business combinations” between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these business combinations include a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities an interested stockholder is defined as any person and certain affiliates of such person who beneficially owns ten percent or more 

of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock of the corporation the law also requires a two supermajority stockholder votes for such transactions this means that the transaction must be approved by at least 

 

the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under the maryland general corporation law as permitted by the statute the board of directors of the company irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination among the company george m marcus who is the chairman of the company and mmc or any entity owned or controlled by mr marcus and mmc consequently the fiveyear prohibition and supermajority vote requirements described above will not apply to any business combination between the company mr marcus or mmc as a result the company may in the future enter into business combinations with mr marcus and mmc without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland business combination act 

certain provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement charter and bylaws and certain provisions of the maryland general corporation law could delay defer or prevent a change in control while the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on the company’s power to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company’s stock or otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect their interests the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership the company may not without first obtaining the consent of a majority in interest of the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of the company’s general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity such limitations on the company’s power to act may result in the company’s being precluded from taking action that the board of directors otherwise believes is in the best interests of the company or its stockholders 

the company’s charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other terms of such stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock the company may establish one or more classes or series of stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control such a transaction might involve a premium price for the company’s stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock also such a class or series of stock could have dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interests of holders of common stock 

the company’s charter contains provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

the maryland general corporation law restricts the voting rights of holders of shares deemed to be “control shares” under the maryland general corporation law “control shares” are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the company’s stockholders 

the company’s charter and bylaws as well as maryland general corporation law also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of the company’s board of directors and that in turn may delay defer or prevent a transaction including a change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the companys stockholders those provisions include among others 

 

a breach of the company’s privacy or information security systems could materially adversely affect the company’s business and financial condition  the protection of tenant employee and company data is critically important to the company our business requires us including some of our vendors to use and store personally identifiable and other sensitive information of its tenants and employees the collection and use of personally identifiable information is governed by federal and state laws and regulations privacy and information security laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another compliance with all such laws and regulations may increase the company’s operating costs and adversely impact the company’s ability to market the company’s properties and services 

the security measures put in place by the company and such vendors cannot provide absolute security and the company and our vendors information technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to criminal cyberattacks or data security incidents including ransom of data such as without limitation tenant andor employee information due to employee error malfeasance or other vulnerabilities any such incident could compromise the company’s or such vendors networks and the information stored by the company or such vendors could be accessed misused publicly disclosed corrupted lost or stolen resulting in fraud including wire fraud related to company assets or other harm moreover if a data security incident or breach affects the company’s systems or such vendors systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information the company’s reputation and brand could be materially damaged and the company may be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability including without limitation loss related to the fact that agreements with such vendors or such vendors financial condition may not allow the company to recover all costs related to a cyber breach for which they alone or they and the company should be jointly responsible for which could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

in the third quarter of 2014 the company discovered and reported that certain of its computer networks containing personal and proprietary information were compromised by a cyberintrusion based on information from our forensic investigation the company has confirmed that evidence exists of exfiltration of data on company systems but found no evidence that any individuals information or any company data was misused 

privacy and information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies such as ransomware and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks in light of this network intrusion we discovered in the third quarter of 2014 we have dedicated additional company resources to strengthening the security of the company’s computer systems in the future the company may expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company’s information security measures andor to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities despite these steps there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer a similar data security incident in the future that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on the company’s systems or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner further the techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data such as phishing and other forms of human engineering are increasing in sophistication and are often novel or change frequently accordingly the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures 

expanding social media vehicles present new risks  the use of social media could cause us to suffer brand damage or information leakage negative posts or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our reputation in addition employees or others might disclose nonpublic sensitive information relating to our business through external media channels the continuing evolution of social media will present us with new challenges and risks 

employee theft or fraud could result in loss certain of our employees have access to or signature authority with respect to bank accounts or other company assets which exposes us to the risk of fraud or theft in addition certain employees have access to key information technology it infrastructure and to tenant and other information that is commercially valuable should any employee compromise our it systems or misappropriate tenant or other information we could incur losses including significant financial or reputational harm from which full recovery cannot be assured we also may not have 

insurance that covers any losses in full or that covers losses from particular criminal acts as of december 31 2016 potential liabilities for theft or fraud are not quantifiable and an estimate of possible loss cannot be made 

any material weaknesses identified in the companys internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on the company’s stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires the company to evaluate and report on its internal control over financial reporting if the company identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting the company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on the company’s stock price 

tax risks 

sales of apartment communities could incur tax risks  if we are found to have held acquired or developed a community primarily with the intent to resell the community federal tax laws may limit our ability to sell the community without incurring a 100 tax on the gain on the sale of the community and potentially adversely impacting our status as a real estate investment trust “reit” unless we own the community through one of our taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” 

there are various us tax risks in connection with an investment in the company and in essex portfolio lp the company has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code the company’s qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy numerous annual and quarterly requirements including income asset and distribution tests established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 

to qualify under the income test i at least 75 of the company’s annual gross income generally must be derived from rents from real property mortgage interest gain from the sale or other disposition of real property held for investment dividends or other distributions on and gain from the sale or other disposition of shares of other reits and certain other limited categories of income and ii at least 95 of the company’s annual gross income generally must be derived from the preceding sources plus other dividends interest other than mortgage interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock and securities held for investment to qualify under the asset test at the end of each quarter at least 75 of the value of the company’s assets must consist of cash cash items government securities and qualified real estate assets and there are significant additional limitations regarding the company’s investment in securities other than government securities and qualified real estate assets including limitations on the percentage of our assets that can be represented by the company’s trss to qualify under the distribution test the company generally must distribute to its shareholders each calendar year at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined before a deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain in addition to the extent the company satisfies the 90 test but distributes less than 100 of its reit taxable income it will be subject to corporate income tax on such undistributed income and could be subject to an additional 4 excise tax because the company needs to meet these tests to maintain its qualification as a reit it could cause the company to have to forego certain business opportunities and potentially require the company to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 

in addition to the income asset and distribution tests described above the company’s qualification as a reit involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company’s control although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enable it to qualify as a reit it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year the company would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on the company’s taxable income at corporate rates and the company would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income the company would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders and the company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders for the purpose of maintaining reit status 

changes in tax laws future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions any of which could have retroactive effect could adversely affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit or could generally result in reits having fewer tax advantages and may lead reit’s to determine that it would be more advantageous to elect to be taxed for federal income tax purposes as corporations changes in the code may not necessarily lead to conforming changes in the tax laws of various states some states use the legislative process to decide whether it is in their best interests to conform or not to various provisions of the code this could increase the complexity of our compliance efforts increase compliance costs and may subject us to additional taxes and audit risk 

the company has established several trss the trss must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its trss do not adversely affect its reit qualification it cannot provide assurances that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore the company may be subject to a 100 penalty tax or its 

trss may be denied deductions to the extent dealings between the company and its trss are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature the company intends that its dealings with its trss will be on an arm’s length basis no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not assert a contrary position 

the company owns interests in multiple subsidiary reits that have elected to be taxed as reits under the code these subsidiary reits are subject to the various reit qualification requirements and other limitations that are applicable to the company if any of the company’s subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit then i the subsidiary reit would become subject to federal income tax and ii the company’s ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit would cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits if any of the company’s subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as reits it is possible that the company could also fail to qualify as a reit 

from time to time the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties under the code unless certain exceptions apply any gain resulting from transfers of properties that the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business could be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since the company acquires properties for investment purposes it does not believe that its occasional transfers or disposals of property should be treated as prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by the company are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then the company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to it from the prohibited transaction and the company’s ability to retain proceeds from real property sales may be jeopardized 

dividends paid by reits to us stockholders that are individuals trusts or estates are generally not eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividends received from nonreit corporations the maximum rate on qualified dividends is currently 238 rather us individual trust or estate stockholders who receive dividends from a reit that are not designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed on such dividends at ordinary income rates at a current maximum rate of 434 this may cause investors to view reit investments to be less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock in reits including the company’s stock 

nonus investors that invest in the company should be aware of the following us federal income tax considerations in connection with such investment first distributions by the company from its current and accumulated earnings and profits are subject to a 30 us withholding tax in the hands of nonus investors unless the 30 is reduced by an applicable income tax treaty such distributions may also be subject to a 30 withholding tax under the “foreign account tax compliance act” “fatca” unless a nonus investor complies with certain requirements prescribed by fatca second distributions by the company that are attributable to gains from dispositions of us real property “capital gain dividends” will be treated as income that is effectively connected with a us trade or business in the hands of a nonus investor such that a nonus investor will have us federal income tax payment and filing obligations with respect to capital gain dividends furthermore capital gain dividends may be subject to an additional 30 “branch profits tax” which may be reduced by an applicable income tax treaty in the hands of a nonus investor that is a corporation third any gain derived by a nonus investor on a disposition of such investor’s stock in the company will subject such investor to us federal income tax payment and filing requirements unless the company is treated as a domesticallycontrolled reit a reit is “domestically controlled” if less than 50 of the reit’s capital stock by value has been owned directly or indirectly by persons who are not qualifying us persons during a continuous fiveyear period ending on the date of disposition or if shorter during the entire period of the reit’s existence the company believes that it is a domesticallycontrolled reit but no assurances can be given in this regard notwithstanding the foregoing even if the company were not a domesticallycontrolled reit under a special exception nonus investors should not have us federal income tax payment and filing obligations on capital gain dividends or a disposition of their stock in the company if i they did not own more than 10 of such stock at any time during the oneyear period ending on the date of the disposition and ii the company’s stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market located in the united states and certain other nonus investors may also not be subject to these payment and filing obligations nonus investors should consult with their independent advisors as to the above us tax considerations and other us tax consequences of an investment in the company’s stock in light of their particular circumstances 

the company believes that its operating partnership essex portfolio lp will continue to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes as a partnership essex portfolio lp is not subject to us federal income tax on its income instead each of its partners is required to pay tax on the partner’s allocable share of the income of essex portfolio lp no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not challenge essex portfolio lp’s status as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the internal revenue service were successful in treating essex portfolio lp as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes the company 

could fail to meet the income tests andor the asset tests applicable to reits and accordingly cease to qualify as a reit also the failure of essex portfolio lp to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for distribution to its partners

 item 2 properties 

the company’s portfolio as of december 31 2016  including communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures but excluding communities underlying preferred equity investments was comprised of 245  operating apartment communities 

comprising 59645  apartment homes of which 27968  apartment homes are located in southern california 19480  apartment homes are located in the san francisco bay area and 12197  apartment homes are located in the seattle metropolitan area the company’s apartment communities accounted for 994  of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2016  

occupancy rates 

financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total potential rental revenue actual rental revenue for occupied apartment homes plus market rent for vacant apartment homes when calculating actual rents for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes delinquencies and concessions are not taken into account total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment homes with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates and the companys calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy as disclosed by other reits market rates are determined using a variety of factors such as effective rental rates at the property based on recently signed leases and asking rates for comparable properties in the market the recently signed effective rates at the property are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes the company then increases or decreases these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community’s market the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market 

for communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while a community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy 

communities 

the company’s communities are primarily suburban gardenstyle communities comprising multiple clusters of two and threestory buildings situated on three to fifteen acres of land as of december 31 2016  the company’s communities include 156  gardenstyle 83  midrise and 6  highrise communities the communities have an average of approximately 243  apartment homes with a mix of studio one two and some threebedroom apartment homes a wide variety of amenities are available at the company’s communities including covered parking fireplaces swimming pools clubhouses with fitness facilities volleyball and playground areas and tennis courts

market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes the company may increase or decrease these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community’s market the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates and the companys calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy as disclosed by other reits 

the company does not take into account delinquency and concessions to calculate actual rent for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes the calculation of financial occupancy compares contractual rates for occupied apartment homes to estimated market rents for unoccupied apartment homes and thus the calculation compares the gross value of all apartment homes excluding delinquency and concessions for apartment communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while an apartment community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities the company defines critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require the companys management to exercise their most difficult subjective and complex judgments the company’s critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas i accounting for business combinations ii consolidation under applicable accounting standards of various entities iii assessing the carrying values of the companys real estate and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates and iv internal cost capitalization the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 

the company accounts for its business combinations including the merger and other acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with asc 80510 business combinations which requires the acquired tangible and intangible assets and 

liabilities to be recorded at fair value with excess purchase price if any recorded to goodwill the company must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired and consideration transferred the use of different assumptions in estimating the fair value could affect the measurement and timing of recognition of acquired assets and liabilities and related expenses 

the consideration transferred in a business combination is generally measured at fair value for debt assumed by the company the fair value is determined using estimated market interest rates for debt with comparable terms in place at the time of the acquisition for equity issued by the company the fair value is generally based on the fair value of the company’s equity interests at the date of issuance 

the fair value of the tangible assets which principally includes land and building is determined first by valuing the property as a whole as if it were vacant using stabilized net operating income and market specific capitalization rates the fair value of the land and building is then recorded based on its estimated fair value 

in calculating the fair value of identified intangible assets of an acquired property the inplace leases are valued based on inplace rent rates and amortized over the average remaining term of all acquired leases 

the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie if such an entity is a vie then the company performs an analysis to determine who is the primary beneficiary if the company is the primary beneficiary then the entity is consolidated the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 

the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 

further the company evaluates whether its coinvestments are other than temporarily impaired and if so records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the coinvestments carrying value over its estimated fair value 

the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs including interest and real estate taxes incurred during development and redevelopment activities interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period included in capitalized costs are management’s accounting estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with the companys development and redevelopment activities indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development including accounting legal fees and various corporate and community onsite costs that clearly relate to projects under development 

the company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions

sameproperty net operating income “sameproperty noi” is considered by management to be an important supplemental performance measure to earnings from operations included in the company’s consolidated statements of income the presentation of sameproperty noi assists with the presentation of the company’s operations prior to the allocation of depreciation and any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs sameproperty noi which is based on net operating income noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual communities or groups of communities prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate and noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets the company defines sameproperty noi as sameproperty revenue less sameproperty operating expenses

essex issued approximately 231 million shares of essex common stock as stock consideration in the merger for purchase accounting the value of the common stock issued by essex upon the consummation of the merger was determined based on the closing price of bre’s common stock on the closing date of the merger as a result of essex being admitted to the sp 500 on the same date as the closing of the merger essex’s common stock price experienced significantly higher than usual trading volume and the closing price of 174 per share was significantly higher than its volumeweighted average trading price for the days before and after april 1 2014 bre’s common stock did not experience the same proportionate increase in common stock price leading up to april 1 2014 as a result given that a substantial component of the purchase price is an exchange of equity instruments essex used the closing price of bre’s common stock on april 1 2014 of 61 per share less the cash consideration as the fair value of the equity consideration after deducting the special dividend and the cash consideration per share this resulted in a value of 4867 per share of bre common stock which is the equivalent of approximately 164 per share of essex common stock issued

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily homes if the demand for the company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing housing rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations

working capital

the timing source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates stock price and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment which can affect the company’s plans for acquisitions dispositions development and redevelopment activities 

environmental considerations 

see the discussion under the caption “risks related to real estate investments and our operations  the company’s portfolio may have environmental liabilities ” in item 1a risk factors for information concerning the potential effect of environmental regulations on its operations which discussion under the caption “ the company’s portfolio may have environmental liabilities ” is incorporated by reference into this item 1 

other matters 

certain policies of the company 

the company intends to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject it to regulation under the investment company act of 1940 the company has in the past five years and may in the future i issue securities senior to its common stock ii fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and iii offer shares of common stock andor units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for property acquisitions the company from time to time acquires partnership interests in partnerships and joint ventures either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries of the company when such entities’ underlying assets are real estate 

the company invests primarily in apartment communities that are located in predominantly coastal markets within southern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area the company currently intends to continue to invest in apartment communities in such regions however these practices may be reviewed and modified periodically by management 




 item 1a risk factors 

for purposes of this section the term “stockholders” means the holders of shares of essex property trust inc’s common stock and preferred stock set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to essex property trust inc’s stockholders and essex portfolio lp’s unit holders you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our company our properties and our business 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual operating results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

risks related to our real estate investments and operations 

general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values  real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks if the communities and other real estate investments do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected income from the communities may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

 

as leases at the communities expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to the company income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws ex the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and tax laws real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore the company’s ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents and the company may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire   substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less if the company is unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates then the company’s results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected with these short term leases our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

we may pursue acquisitions dispositions investments and joint ventures which could adversely affect our results of operations we may make acquisitions of and investments in businesses that offer complementary properties and communities to augment our market coverage or enhance our property offerings we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition investment alliance or joint venture opportunities that we will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us or that such transactions or relationships will be successful in addition our original estimates and assumptions used in assessing any acquisition may be inaccurate and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such acquisition from time to time we may also divest portions of our business that are no longer strategically important or exit minority investments which could materially affect our ffo cash flows and results of operations 

these transactions or any other acquisitions or dispositions involve risks and uncertainties for example as a consequence of such transactions we may assume unknown liabilities which could ultimately lead to material costs for us in addition the integration of acquired businesses or other acquisitions may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business to integrate acquired businesses or other acquisitions we must implement our management information systems operating systems and internal controls and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations there can be no assurance that all preacquisition property due diligence will have identified all material issues that might arise with respect to such acquired business and its properties or as to any such other acquisitions 

any acquisition may also cause us to assume liabilities and ongoing lawsuits acquire goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges incur amortization expense related 

to certain intangible assets increase our expenses and working capital requirements and subject us to litigation which would reduce our return on invested capital in addition if the businesses or properties that we acquire have a different pricing or cost structure than we do such acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability and reduce our overall margin failure to manage and successfully integrate the acquisitions we make or to improve margins of the acquired businesses and products could materially harm our business operating results and margins any dispositions we may make may also result in ongoing obligations to us following any such divestiture for example as a result of any transition services or indemnities we agree to provide to the purchaser in any such transaction which may result in additional expenses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

any future acquisitions we make may also require significant additional debt or equity financing which in the case of debt financing would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings and in the case of equity or equitylinked financing could be dilutive to our existing stockholders any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms as a result of the foregoing we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past or at all these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

national and regional economic environments can negatively impact the company’s operating results  the companys forecast for the national economy assumes growth of the gross domestic product of the national economy and the economies of the west coast states in the event of a recession the company could incur reductions in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising and turnover expenses 

inflationdeflation may affect rental rates and operating expenses  substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses 

acquisitions of communities involve various risks and uncertainties and may fail to meet expectations  the company intends to continue to acquire apartment communities however there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet the company’s expectations the company’s estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow the company to market an acquired apartment community as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate also in connection with such acquisitions we may assume unknown liabilities which could ultimately lead to material costs for us the company expects to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by the company the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the company’s existing stockholders if the company finances new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless the company obtains substitute financing the company may not be able to undertake additional borrowing for further acquisitions or developments or such borrowing may be not available on advantageous terms 

our apartment communities may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities which could cause us to incur substantial costs the properties that the company owns or may acquire are or may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which the company may have no recourse or only limited recourse against the sellers in general the representations and warranties provided under the transaction agreements related to the sales of the properties may not survive the closing of the transactions while the company will seek to require the sellers to indemnify us with respect to breaches of representations and warranties that survive such indemnification may be limited and subject to various materiality thresholds a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses as a result there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties in addition the total amount of costs and expenses that may be incurred with respect to liabilities associated with apartment communities may exceed our expectations and we may experience other unanticipated adverse effects all of which may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

development and redevelopment activities may be delayed not completed andor not achieve expected results  the company pursues development and redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals which have no assurance of being received the company’s development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including the following 

 8 

 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the company’s stockholders further the development and redevelopment of communities is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see the risk factor above titled “ general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values ” 

difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit liquidity and financial flexibility   if we are found to have held acquired or developed a community primarily with the intent to resell the community federal tax laws may limit our ability to sell the community without incurring a 100 tax on the gain on the sale of the community and potentially adversely impacting our status as a real estate investment trust “reit” unless we own the community through one of our taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” in addition real estate in our markets can at times be difficult to sell quickly at prices we find acceptable these potential difficulties in selling real estate in our markets may limit our ability to change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the geographic concentration of the company’s communities and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and operating results  the company generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  from the company’s communities concentrated in southern california los angeles orange santa barbara san diego and ventura counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area for the year ended december 31 2015  83  of the company’s rental revenues were generated from communities located in california this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations in general factors that may adversely affect local market and economic conditions include the following 

 

the company may experience various increased costs including increased property taxes to own and maintain its properties   real property taxes on our properties may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change thus our real estate taxes in the state of washington could increase as a result of property value reassessments or increased property tax rates in that state a current california law commonly referred to as proposition 13 generally limits annual real estate tax increases on california properties to 2 of assessed value however under proposition 13 property tax reassessment generally occurs as a result of a “change in ownership” of a property as specially defined for purposes of those rules because the property taxing authorities may not determine whether there has been a “change in ownership” or the actual reassessed value of a property for a period of time after a transaction has occurred we may not know the impact of a potential reassessment for a considerable amount of time following a particular transaction therefore the amount of property taxes we are required to pay could increase substantially from the property taxes we currently pay or have paid in the past including on a retroactive basis in addition from time to time voters and lawmakers have announced initiatives to repeal or amend proposition 13 to eliminate its application to commercial and industrial property andor introduce split tax roll legislation such initiatives if successful could increase the assessed value andor tax rates applicable to commercial property in california including our apartment communities 

the company may experience increased costs associated with capital improvements and routine property maintenance such as repairs to the foundation exterior walls and rooftops of its properties as its properties advance through their lifecycles increases in the company’s expenses to own and maintain its properties could adversely impact the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

competition in the apartment community market may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for the company’s communities  there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily homes that are available for rent or for sale in the markets in which the communities are located competitive housing in a particular area and the increasing affordability of 

owner occupied single and multifamily homes caused by lower housing prices mortgage interest rates and government programs to promote home ownership could adversely affect the company’s ability to retain its residents lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents if the demand for the company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing apartment communities rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations the company also faces competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities this competition may result in an increase in costs and prices of apartment communities that the company acquires andor develops 

investments in mortgages and other real estate securities could affect the company’s ability to make distributions to stockholders the company may invest in equity preferred equity or debt securities related to real estate which could adversely affect the company’s ability to make distributions to stockholders the company may purchase or otherwise invest in securities issued by entities which own real estate andor invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations these mortgages may be first second or third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed the company may acquire mezzanine loans which take the form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity or entities that owns the interest in the entity owning the property in general investments in mortgages include the following risks 

 

if any of the above were to occur it could adversely affect the company’s cash flows from operations 

the company’s joint ventures and joint ownership of communities and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the company’s ability to control such communities and partial interests  instead of purchasing and developing apartment communities directly the company has invested and may continue to invest in joint ventures joint venture partners often have shared control over the development and operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company’s business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to the company’s instructions or requests or its policies or objectives consequently a joint venture partners’ actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives the company may be unable to take action without its joint venture partners’ approval or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without its consent a joint venture partner might fail to approve decisions that are in the company’s best interest should a joint venture partner become bankrupt the company could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities in some instances the company and the joint venture partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause the company to sell its interest or acquire a partner’s interest at a time when the company otherwise would have not have initiated such a transaction 

from time to time the company through the operating partnership invests in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing financing or managing real property for example the company has made preferred equity investments in third party entities that own real estate with preferred equity investments and certain other investments the operating partnership’s interest in a particular entity is typically less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership’s objectives the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity the company may also incur losses if any guarantees or indemnifications were made by the company the company also owns properties indirectly under downreit structures the company has and in the future may enter into transactions that could require the company to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets into downreits joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within the company’s control occur although the company plans to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on sale pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the code the company can provide no assurance that the company will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they could have a material impact on its financial position 

compliance with laws benefiting disabled persons may require the company to make significant unanticipated expenditures or impact the company’s investment strategy  a number of federal state and local laws including the americans with disabilities act and regulations exist that may require modifications to existing buildings or restrict certain renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons and may require other structural features which add to the cost of buildings under construction legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by disabled persons the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial noncompliance with these laws could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures 

the company’s portfolio may have environmental liabilities  under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we have been from time to time and may be required in the future regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases naturally occurring substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for response costs property damage personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the impacts resulting from such releases while the company is unaware of any such response action required or damage claims associated with its existing properties which individually or in aggregate would have a materially adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations potential future costs and damage claims may be substantial and could exceed any insurance coverage we may have for such events or such coverage may not exist further the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate any such impacts may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the impacted site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of responding to hazardous or toxic substance or petroleum product releases  

certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials acms into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of apartment communities for personal injury associated with acms in connection with the ownership direct or indirect operation management and development of our communities the company could be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and costs related to injuries of persons and property 

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property the company carries certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk as to its properties however such coverage is not fully available for all properties and as to those properties for which limited coverage is fully available it may not apply to certain claims arising from known conditions present on those properties in general in connection with the ownership operation financing management and development of its communities the company may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities the company may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to third persons and damage to their property 

properties which we intend to acquire undergo a preacquisition phase i environmental site assessment which is intended to afford the company protection against socalled “owner liability” under the primary federal environmental law as well as further environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling except where conditions warranting such further assessment are identified and seller’s consent is obtained while such assessments are conducted in accordance with applicable “all appropriate inquiry standards no assurance can be given that all environmental conditions present on or beneath or emanating from a given property will be discovered or that the full nature and extent of those conditions which are discovered will be adequately ascertained and quantified 

in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings the company does so pursuant to appropriate environmental regulatory requirements with the objective of obtaining regulatory closure or a no further action determination that will allow for future use development and sale of any impacted community 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed in a timely manner although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions the company has adopted policies for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold when it is detected and to minimize any 

impact mold might have on residents of the property the company believes its mold policies and proactive response to address any known existence reduce its risk of loss from these cases however no assurance can be provided that the company has identified and responded to all mold occurrences 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as proposition 65 requiring that clear and reasonable warnings be given to persons who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke although the company has sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements the company cannot assure you that the company will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 65

subsequent changes in the fair value of our land holdings which we determine is less that the carrying basis of our land holdings reflected in our financial statements plus estimated costs to sell we may be required to take future impairment changes which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

capital and credit market conditions may affect the company’s access to sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could negatively affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition   in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to the company may be adversely affected our current balance sheet the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a diversified bank group access to the public and private placement debt markets and secured debt financing providers such as fannie mae and freddie mac provides some insulation from volatile capital markets we primarily use external financing including sales of equity securities to fund acquisitions developments and redevelopments and to refinance indebtedness as it matures if sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms we could be forced to limit our acquisition development and redevelopment activity andor take other actions to fund our business activities and repayment of debt such as selling assets reducing our cash dividend or paying out less than 100 of our taxable income in general to the extent that the company’s access to capital and credit is at a higher cost than the company has experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing without a corresponding change to investment cap rates the company’s ability to make acquisitions develop communities obtain new financing and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates could be adversely affected which would impact the companys financial standing and related credit rating in addition if our ability to obtain financing is adversely affected we may be unable to satisfy scheduled maturities on existing financing through other sources of our liquidity which could result in lender foreclosure on the apartment communities securing such debt 

the company could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac and by changes in government support for multifamily housing   historically the company has utilized borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future beginning in 2011 the company has primarily utilized unsecured debt and has repaid secured debt at or near their respective maturity and has placed less reliance on agency mortgage debt financing the administration and lawmakers have proposed potential options for the future of agency mortgage finance in the us that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government or if there is reduced government support for support for multifamily housing more generally it may adversely affect interest rates capital availability development of multifamily communities and the value of multifamily residential real estate and as a result may adversely affect the company and its growth and operations 

debt financing has inherent risks   at december 31 2015 the company had approximately 53 billion  of indebtedness including 5253 million  of variable rate indebtedness of which 2250 million  is subject to interest rate swaps effectively fixing the interest rate and 207 million is subject to interest rate cap protectionthe company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the following 

 

the company may not be able to renew repay or refinance its indebtedness when due or may be required to refinance its indebtedness at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness if the company is unable to refinance its indebtedness on acceptable terms or not at all the company might be forced to dispose of one or more of its properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses such losses could have an adverse effect on the company and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders and pay amounts due on its debt furthermore if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and the company is unable to meet mortgage payments the mortgagee could foreclose on the property appoint a receiver and exercise rights under an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies all with a consequential loss of revenues and asset value foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds thereby hindering our ability to meet reit distribution requirements 

debt financing of communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service debt and fund distributions   where appropriate the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on the company’s investments and to provide for additional investments that the company could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the 

communities will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations working capital and capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent our cash flow is subject to general economic industry regional financial competitive operating legislative regulatory taxation and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

as of december 31 2015 the company had 69 consolidated communities encumbered by debt with respect to the 69 communities encumbered by debt all of them are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those communities the holders of this indebtedness will have rights with respect to these communities and if debt payment obligations are not met lenders may seek foreclosure of communities which would reduce the company’s income and net asset value and its ability to service other debt 

compliance requirements of taxexempt financing and below market rent requirements may limit income from certain communities  at december 31 2015 the company had approximately 2817 million  of variable rate taxexempt financing this taxexempt financing provides for certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants the company expects to engage in taxexempt financings in the future the code and rules and regulations thereunder impose various restrictions conditions and requirements in order to allow the note holder to exclude interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes the code also requires that at least 20 of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed a specified percentage generally 50 of the median income for the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development department of the federal government certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed communities if the company is required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and the company may be subject to additional contractual liability besides the limitations due to taxexempt financing requirements the income from certain communities may be limited due to below market rent bmr requirements imposed by local authorities in connection with the original development of the community 

the indentures governing our notes and other financing arrangements contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility  the indentures that govern our publicly registered notes contain financial and operating covenants that among other things restrict our ability to take specific actions even if we believe them to be in our best interest including restrictions on our ability to 

 

the instruments governing our other unsecured indebtedness require us to meet specified financial covenants including covenants relating to net worth fixed charge coverage debt service coverage the amounts of total indebtedness and secured indebtedness leverage and certain investment limitations these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies our ability to comply with these provisions and those contained in the indentures governing the notes may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance changes in general business and economic conditions adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting us the breach of any of these covenants including those contained in our indentures could result in a default under our indebtedness which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable if any of our indebtedness is accelerated we may not be able to repay it 

rising interest rates may affect the company’s costs of capital and financing activities and results of operation interest rates could increase which could result in higher interest expense on the company’s variable rate indebtedness or increase interest rates when refinancing maturing fixed rate debt prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company’s ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with positive economic returns on investment and the company’s ability to refinance existing borrowings 

interest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses  the company from time to time uses interest rate swaps and interest rate caps contracts to manage certain interest rate risks although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged the company may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the company to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk the company enters into hedging arrangements only with investment grade financial institutions 

a downgrade in the companys investment grade credit rating could materially and adversely affect its business and financial condition   the company plans to manage its operations to maintain its investment grade credit rating with a capital structure consistent with its current profile but there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain its current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on the company’s cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on its financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

changes in the company’s financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness   the company’s organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a limit on debt financing consistent with the existing covenants required to maintain the company’s unsecured line of credit bank facility unsecured debt and senior unsecured bonds although pursuant to this policy the company manages its debt to be in compliance with the debt covenants the company may increase the amount of outstanding debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in the company’s ability to service the additional debt accordingly the company could become more leveraged resulting in an increased risk of default of its debt covenants or on its debt obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements any covenant breach or significant increase in the company’s leverage could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 

if the company or its subsidiaries defaults on an obligation to repay outstanding indebtedness when due the default could trigger a crossdefault or crossacceleration under other indebtedness   if the company or one of its subsidiaries defaults on its obligations to repay outstanding indebtedness the default could cause a crossdefault or crossacceleration under other indebtedness a default under the agreements governing the company’s or its subsidiaries’ indebtedness including a default under mortgage indebtedness lines of credit bank term loan or the indenture for the company’s outstanding senior notes that is not waived by the required lenders or holders of outstanding notes could trigger crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions under one or more agreements governing the company’s indebtedness which could cause an immediate default or allow the lenders to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable

to qualify under the income test i at least 75 of the company’s annual gross income generally must be derived from rents from real property mortgage interest gain from the sale or other disposition of real property held for investment dividends or other distributions on and gain from the sale or other disposition of shares of other reits and certain other limited categories of income and ii at least 95 of the company’s annual gross income generally must be derived from the preceding sources plus other dividends interest other than mortgage interest and gain from the sale or other disposition of stock and securities held for investment to qualify under the asset test at the end of each quarter at least 75 of the value of the company’s assets must consist of cash cash items government securities and qualified real estate assets and there are significant additional limitations regarding the company’s investment in securities other than government securities and qualified real estate assets including limitations on the percentage of our assets that can be represented by the company’s taxable reit subsidiaries “trs’s” to qualify under the distribution test the company generally must distribute to its shareholders each calendar year at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined before a deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain in addition to the extent the company satisfies the 90 test but distributes less than 100 of its reit taxable income it will be subject to corporate income tax on such undistributed income and could be subject to an additional 4 excise tax because the company needs to meet these tests to maintain its qualification as a reit it could cause the company to have to forego certain business opportunities and potentially require the company to liquidate otherwise attractive investments 

in addition to the income asset and distribution tests described above the company’s qualification as a reit involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company’s control although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enable it to qualify as a reit it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions any of which could have retroactive effect could adversely affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect the company’s stockholders if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year the company would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on the company’s taxable income at corporate rates and the company would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income the company would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders and the company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders for the purpose of maintaining reit status 

the company has established several trss the trss must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its trss do not adversely affect its reit qualification it cannot provide assurances that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore the company may be subject to a 100 penalty tax or its trss may be denied deductions to the extent dealings between the company and its trss are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature the company intends that its dealings with its trss will be on an arm’s length basis no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not assert a contrary position 

the company owns interests in multiple subsidiary reits that have elected to be taxed as reits under the code these subsidiary reits are subject to the various reit qualification requirements and other limitations that are applicable to the company if any of the company’s subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as a reit then i the subsidiary reit would become subject to federal income tax and ii the company’s ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit would cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits if any of the company’s subsidiary reits were to fail to qualify as reits it is possible that the company could also fail to qualify as a reit 

from time to time the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties under the code unless certain exceptions apply any gain resulting from transfers of properties that the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business could be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since the company acquires properties for investment purposes it does not believe that its occasional transfers or disposals of property should be treated as prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by the company are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then the company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to it from the prohibited transaction and the company’s ability to retain proceeds from real property sales may be jeopardized income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect the company’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes therefore no assurances can be given that the company will be able to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit if the company transferred or disposed of property in a transaction treated as a prohibited transaction 

dividends paid by reits to us stockholders that are individuals trusts or estates are generally not eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividends received from nonreit corporations the maximum rate on qualified dividends is 

currently 238 rather us individual trust or estate stockholders who receive dividends from a reit that are not designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed on such dividends at ordinary income rates at a current maximum rate of 434 this may cause investors to view reit investments to be less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock in reits including the company’s stock 

nonus investors that invest in the company should be aware of the following us federal income tax considerations in connection with such investment first distributions by the company from its current and accumulated earnings and profits are subject to a 30 us withholding tax in the hands of nonus investors unless the 30 is reduced by an applicable income tax treaty such distributions may also be subject to a 30 withholding tax under the “foreign account tax compliance act” “fatca” unless a nonus investor complies with certain requirements prescribed by fatca second distributions by the company that are attributable to gains from dispositions of us real property “capital gain dividends” will be treated as income that is effectively connected with a us trade or business in the hands of a nonus investor such that a nonus investor will have us federal income tax payment and filing obligations with respect to capital gain dividends furthermore capital gain dividends may be subject to an additional 30 “branch profits tax” which may be reduced by an applicable income tax treaty in the hands of a nonus investor that is a corporation third any gain derived by a nonus investor on a disposition of such investor’s stock in the company will subject such investor to us federal income tax payment and filing requirements unless the company is treated as a domesticallycontrolled reit a reit is “domestically controlled” if less than 50 of the reit’s capital stock by value has been owned directly or indirectly by persons who are not qualifying us persons during a continuous fiveyear period ending on the date of disposition or if shorter during the entire period of the reit’s existence the company believes that it is a domesticallycontrolled reit but no assurances can be given in this regard notwithstanding the foregoing even if the company were not a domesticallycontrolled reit under a special exception nonus investors should not have us federal income tax payment and filing obligations on capital gain dividends or a disposition of their stock in the company if i they did not own more than 10 of such stock at any time during the oneyear period ending on the date of the disposition and ii the company’s stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market located in the united states and certain other nonus investors may also not be subject to these payment and filing obligations nonus investors should consult with their independent advisors as to the above us tax considerations and other us tax consequences of an investment in the company’s stock in light of their particular circumstances 

the company believes that its operating partnership essex portfolio lp will continue to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes as a partnership essex portfolio lp is not subject to us federal income tax on its income instead each of its partners is required to pay tax on the partner’s allocable share of the income of essex portfolio lp no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not challenge essex portfolio lp’s status as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the internal revenue service were successful in treating essex portfolio lp as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes the company could fail to meet the income tests andor the asset tests applicable to reits and accordingly cease to qualify as a reit also the failure of essex portfolio lp to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for distribution to its partners

 item 2 properties 

the company’s portfolio as of december 31 2015  including communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures but excluding communities underlying preferred equity investments was comprised of 246  apartment communities comprising 59160  apartment homes of which 28039  apartment homes are located in southern california 18924  apartment homes are located in the san francisco bay area and 12197  apartment homes are located in the seattle metropolitan area the company’s apartment communities accounted for 993  of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2015  

occupancy rates 

financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total potential rental revenue actual rental revenue for occupied apartment homes plus market rent for vacant apartment homes when calculating actual rents for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes delinquencies and concessions are not taken into account total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment homes with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates and the companys calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy as disclosed by other reits market rates are determined using a variety of factors such as effective rental rates at the property based on recently signed leases and asking rates for comparable properties in the market the recently signed effective rates at the property are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes the company then increases or decreases these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community’s market the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market 

for communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while a community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy 

communities 

the company’s communities are primarily suburban gardenstyle communities and town homes comprising multiple clusters of two and threestory buildings situated on three to fifteen acres of land as of december 31 2015  the company’s communities include 162  gardenstyle 78  midrise and 6  highrise communities the communities have an average of approximately 240  apartment homes with a mix of studio one two and some threebedroom apartment homes a wide variety of amenities are available at the company’s communities including covered parking fireplaces swimming pools clubhouses with fitness facilities volleyball and playground areas and tennis courts

results of operations 

comparison of year ended december 31 2015  to the year ended december 31 2014   

the company’s average financial occupancies for the company’s stabilized apartment communities or “ 2015  2014  sameproperties” stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  was unchanged at 962  in both 2015  and 2014  financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total potential rental revenue actual rental revenue for occupied apartment homes plus market rent for vacant apartment homes actual rental revenue represents contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total potential rental revenue represents the value of all apartment homes with occupied apartment homes valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant apartment homes valued at estimated market rents we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate 

market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant apartment homes the company may increase or decrease these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community’s market the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates and the companys calculation of financial occupancy may not be comparable to financial occupancy as disclosed by other reits 

the company does not take into account delinquency and concessions to calculate actual rent for occupied apartment homes and market rents for vacant apartment homes the calculation of financial occupancy compares contractual rates for occupied apartment homes to estimated market rents for unoccupied apartment homes and thus the calculation compares the gross value of all apartment homes excluding delinquency and concessions for apartment communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while an apartment community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table sets forth the company’s cash flows for 2015  2014  and 2013   in thousands 



ess’s business is operated primarily through the operating partnership ess issues public equity from time to time but does not otherwise generate any capital itself or conduct any business itself other than incurring certain expenses in operating as a public company which are fully reimbursed by the operating partnership ess itself does not hold any indebtedness and its only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of the operating partnership ess’s principal funding requirement is the payment of dividends on its common stock and preferred stock ess’s sole source of funding for its dividend payments is distributions it receives from the operating partnership 

as of december 31 2015  ess owned a 967  general partner interest and the limited partners owned the remaining 33  interest in the operating partnership 

the liquidity of ess is dependent on the operating partnership’s ability to make sufficient distributions to ess the primary cash requirement of ess is its payment of dividends to its stockholders ess also guarantees some of the operating partnership’s debt as discussed further in notes 7 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein if the operating partnership fails to fulfill certain of its debt requirements which trigger the ess’s guarantee obligations then ess will be required to fulfill its cash payment commitments under such guarantees however ess’s only significant asset is its investment in the operating partnership 

for ess to maintain its qualification as a reit it must pay dividends to its stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its reit taxable income excluding net capital gains while historically ess has satisfied this distribution requirement by making cash distributions to its stockholders it may choose to satisfy this requirement by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances ess’s own stock as a result of this distribution requirement the operating partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its ongoing operations to the same extent that other companies whose parent companies are not reits can ess may need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the operating partnership’s working capital needs acquisitions and developments 

at december 31 2015  the company had 297 million  of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and 1375 million  in marketable securities of which 571 million  were held available for sale the company believes that cash flows generated by its operations existing cash and cash equivalents marketable securities balances availability under existing lines of credit access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of the company’s reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2016  the timing source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment which can affect the company’s plans for acquisitions dispositions development and redevelopment activities 

as of december 31 2015  the company had 4650 million  of private placement unsecured bonds outstanding at an average interest rate of 45  with maturity dates ranging from march 2016 through august 2021 in january 2016 1500 million of these bonds bearing an interest rate of 436 were repaid

the company has two lines of credit aggregating 103 billion  as of december 31 2015  including a 10 billion  unsecured line of credit as of december 31 2015  there was a 150 million balance on this unsecured line of credit with an underlying interest rate of libor plus 095  in january 2016 the facility maturity date was extended to december 31 2019  with one 18month extension exercisable by the company with an underlying interest rate of libor plus 090 the company also has a 250 million  working capital unsecured line of credit agreement as of december 31 2015  there were no amounts outstanding on this unsecured line with an underlying interest rate of libor plus 095  in january 2016 the maturity date was extended to january 2018 and the interest rate was lowered to libor plus 090 

the company’s unsecured line of credit and unsecured debt agreements contain debt covenants related to limitations on indebtedness and liabilities and maintenance of minimum levels of consolidated earnings before depreciation interest and amortization the company was in compliance with the debt covenants as of december 31 2015  and 2014 

the company pays quarterly dividends from cash available for distribution until it is distributed cash available for distribution is invested by the company primarily in investment grade securities held available for sale or is used by the company to reduce balances outstanding under its line of credit 

the company has benefited from borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac and there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future to the extent that the company’s access to capital and credit is at a higher cost than the company has experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing the company’s ability to make acquisitions develop communities obtain new financing and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates could be adversely impacted for the past three years the company has primarily issued unsecured debt and repaid secured debt when it has matured to place less reliance on mortgage debt financing and to unencumber more of the companys communities 

derivative activity 

the company uses interest rate swaps interest rate cap and total return swap contracts to manage certain interest rate risks the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate swaps and total return swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts or payments and the discounted expected variable cash payments or receipts the variable cash payments or receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate curves the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparties nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 

the company has entered into interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 2250 million  that effectively fixed the interest rate on the 2250 million  unsecured term loan at 24  these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting 

  

the company has entered into four total return swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of 2573 million that effectively converts 2573 million of mortgage notes payable to a floating interest rate based on sifma plus a spread additionally the total return swaps provide fair market value protection on the mortgage notes payable to our counterparties during the initial period of the total return swap until the companys option to call the mortgage notes at par can be exercised the company can currently call one of the total return swaps with 1144 million of the outstanding debt at par while the call option on the other three total return swaps relating to 1429 million of the outstanding debt can be exercised starting on january 1 2017 these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting 

as of december 31 2015  the company also had nine  interest rate caps totaling a notional amount of 207 million that effectively limit the company’s exposure to interest rate risk by providing a ceiling on the underlying variable interest rate for 207 million of the company’s tax exempt variable rate debt 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the aggregate carrying value of the interest rate swap contracts was a liability of 10 million  and 18 million  respectively the aggregate carrying value of the interest rate caps was zero on the balance sheets as of both december 31 2015  and 2014  the aggregate carrying value of the total return swaps was 4 thousand and zero as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities the company defines critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require the companys management to exercise their most difficult subjective and complex judgments the company’s critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas i accounting for business combinations ii consolidation under applicable accounting standards of various entities iii assessing the carrying values of the companys real estate and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates and iv internal cost capitalization the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 

the company accounts for its business combinations including the merger and other acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with asc 80510 business combinations which requires the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities to be recorded at fair value with excess purchase price if any recorded to goodwill the company must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired and consideration transferred the use of different assumptions in estimating the fair value could affect the measurement and timing of recognition of acquired assets and liabilities and related expenses 

the consideration transferred in a business combination is generally measured at fair value for debt assumed by the company the fair value is determined using estimated market interest rates for debt with comparable terms in place at the time of the acquisition for equity issued by the company the fair value is generally based on the fair value of the company’s equity interests at the date of issuance 

the fair value of the tangible assets which principally includes land and building is determined first by valuing the property as a whole as if it were vacant using stabilized net operating income and market specific capitalization rates the fair value of the land and building is then recorded based on its estimated fair value 

in calculating the fair value of identified intangible assets of an acquired property the inplace leases are valued based on inplace rent rates and estimated time and cost to lease a unit 

the initial purchase accounting is based on the company’s preliminary assessment which may differ when additional information becomes available subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase accounting if any are made within the measurement period which will be finalized within one year of the acquisition date 

the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie if such an entity is a vie then the company performs an analysis to determine who is the primary beneficiary if the company is the primary beneficiary then the entity is consolidated the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 

the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 

further the company evaluates whether its coinvestments are other than temporarily impaired and if so records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the coinvestments carrying value over its estimated fair value 

the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs including interest and real estate taxes incurred during development and redevelopment activities interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period included in capitalized costs are management’s accounting estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with the companys development and redevelopment activities indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development including accounting legal fees and various corporate and community onsite costs that clearly relate to projects under development 

the company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 

net operating income “noi” 

sameproperty net operating income “noi” is considered by management to be an important supplemental performance measure to earnings from operations included in the company’s consolidated statements of income the presentation of sameproperty noi assists with the presentation of the company’s operations prior to the allocation of depreciation and any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual communities or groups of communities prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate and noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets the company defines sameproperty noi as sameproperty revenue less sameproperty operating expenses

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily homes if the demand for the company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing housing rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations

other matters

the company invests primarily in apartment communities that are located in predominantly coastal markets within southern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area the company currently intends to continue to invest in apartment communities in such regions however these practices may be reviewed and modified periodically by management 




 item 1a risk factors 

for purposes of this section the term “stockholders” means the holders of shares of essex property trust inc’s common stock and preferred stock set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to essex property trust inc’s stockholders and essex portfolio lp’s unit holders you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our company our properties and our business 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual operating results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

risks related to real investments and our operations 

general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values  real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks if the communities do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected income from the communities may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

 

as leases at the communities expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to the company income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws eg the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and tax laws real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore the company’s ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited 

shortterm leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms 

the company may not realize the expected benefits of its merger with bre because of transition difficulties and other challenges   as a result of its merger with bre properties inc the company will face various additional risks including among others the following 

 

any of these risks could adversely affect the companys business and financial results 

we may pursue acquisitions dispositions investments and joint ventures which could adversely affect our results of operations we may make acquisitions of and investments in businesses that offer complementary properties and communities to augment our market coverage or enhance our property offerings such as our recent acquisition of bre we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition investment alliance or joint venture opportunities that we will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us or that such transactions or relationships will be successful in addition 

our original estimates and assumptions used in assessing any acquisition may be inaccurate and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such acquisition from time to time we may also divest portions of our business that are no longer strategically important or exit minority investments which could materially affect our ffo cash flows and results of operations 

these transactions or any other acquisitions or dispositions involve risks and uncertainties for example the integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business to integrate acquired businesses we must implement our management information systems operating systems and internal controls and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations there can be no assurance that all preacquisition property due diligence will have identified all material issues that might arise with respect to such acquired business and its properties 

any acquisition may also cause us to assume liabilities and ongoing lawsuits acquire goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges incur amortization expense related to certain intangible assets increase our expenses and working capital requirements and subject us to litigation which would reduce our return on invested capital in addition if the businesses or properties that we acquire have a different pricing or cost structure than we do such acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability and reduce our overall margin failure to manage and successfully integrate the acquisitions we make or to improve margins of the acquired businesses and products could materially harm our business operating results and margins any dispositions we may make may also result in ongoing obligations to us following any such divestiture for example as a result of any transition services or indemnities we agree to provide to the purchaser in any such transaction which may result in additional expenses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

any future acquisitions we make may also require significant additional debt or equity financing which in the case of debt financing would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings and in the case of equity or equitylinked financing would be dilutive to our existing stockholders we also assumed a significant amount of debt in connection with our acquisition of bre which is secured by the substantial majority of the properties acquired any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms as a result of the foregoing we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past or at all these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations all of the above factors apply to our acquisition of bre 

national and regional economic environments can negatively impact the company’s operating results  during the recent past a confluence of factors has resulted in job losses turmoil and volatility in the capital markets and caused a national and global recession the companys forecast for the national economy assumes growth of the gross domestic product of the national economy and the economies of the west coast states in the event of another recession the company could incur reductions in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising and turnover expenses 

inflationdeflation may affect rental rates and operating expenses  substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses 

acquisitions of communities may fail to meet expectations  the company intends to continue to acquire apartment communities however there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet the company’s expectations the company’s estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow the company to market an acquired apartment community as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate the company expects to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by the company the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the company’s existing stockholders if the company finances new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless the company obtains substitute financing the company may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development or such lines of credit may be not available on advantageous terms 

development and redevelopment activities may be delayed not completed andor not achieve expected results  the company pursues development and redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals which have no assurance of being received the company’s development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including the following 

 8 

 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the company’s stockholders further the development and redevelopment of communities is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see the risk factor titled “ general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values ” 

the geographic concentration of the company’s communities and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and operating results  the company generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2014  from the company’s communities concentrated in southern california los angeles orange santa barbara san diego and ventura counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area for the year ended december 31 2014  80  of the company’s rental revenues were generated from communities located in california this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations the economic condition of these markets could adversely affect underlying asset values and the occupancy property revenues and expenses of the companys communities the financial results of major local employers also may impact the cash flow and value of certain of the communities this could have a negative impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results which could affect the company’s ability to pay expected dividends to its stockholders and the operating partnership’s ability to pay expected distributions to unit holders 

our property taxes could increase due to reassessment or property tax rate changes    real property taxes on our properties may increase as our properties are reassessed by taxing authorities or as property tax rates change thus our real estate taxes in the state of washington could increase as a result of property value reassessments or increased property tax rates in that state a current california law commonly referred to as proposition 13 generally limits annual real estate tax increases on california properties to 2 of assessed value however under proposition 13 property tax reassessment generally occurs as a result of a “change in ownership” of a property as specially defined for purposes of those rules because the property taxing authorities may not determine whether there has been a “change in ownership” or the actual reassessed value of a property for a period of time after a transaction has occurred we may not know the impact of a potential reassessment for a considerable amount of time following a particular transaction therefore the amount of property taxes we are required to pay could increase substantially from the property taxes we currently pay or have paid in the past including on a retroactive basis in addition from time to time voters and lawmakers have announced initiatives to repeal or amend proposition 13   to eliminate its application to commercial and industrial property andor introduce split tax roll legislation such initiatives if successful would increase the assessed value andor tax rates applicable to commercial property in california including our apartment communities an increase in the assessed value of our properties or our property tax rates could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 

competition in the apartment community market may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for the company’s communities  there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the communities are located if the demand for the company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing apartment communities rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations the company also faces competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities this competition may result in an increase in costs and prices of apartment communities that the company acquires andor develops   

bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain communities  at december 31 2014  the company had approximately 1792 million  of variable rate taxexempt financing this taxexempt financing provides for certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants the company expects to engage in taxexempt financings in the future the code and rules and regulations thereunder impose various restrictions conditions and requirements in order to allow the note holder to exclude interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes the code also requires that at least 20 of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed a specified percentage generally 50 of the median income for the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development department of the federal government certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed communities if the company is required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and the company may be subject to additional contractual liability 

investments in mortgages and other real estate securities could affect the company’s ability to make distributions to stockholders the company may invest in securities related to real estate which could adversely affect the company’s ability to make distributions to stockholders the company may purchase securities issued by entities which own real estate and invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations these mortgages may be first second or third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed in general investments in mortgages include the following risks 

 

if any of the above were to occur it could adversely affect cash flows from operations and the company’s ability to make expected dividends to stockholders and the operating partnership’s ability to make expected distributions to unit holders 

compliance with laws benefiting disabled persons may require the company to make significant unanticipated expenditures or impact the company’s investment strategy  a number of federal state and local laws including the americans with disabilities act and regulations exist that may require modifications to existing buildings or restrict certain renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons and may require other structural features which add to the cost of buildings under construction legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by disabled persons the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial 

the company’s portfolio may have environmental liabilities  under various federal state and local environmental and public health laws regulations and ordinances we have been from time to time and may be required in the future regardless of knowledge or responsibility to investigate and remediate the effects of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at our properties including in some cases naturally occurring substances such as methane and radon gas and may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for response costs property damage personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination resulting from such releases while the company is unaware of any such response action required or damage claims associated with its existing properties which individually or in aggregate would have a materially adverse effect on our business assets financial condition or results of operations potential future costs and damage claims may be substantial and could exceed any insurance coverage we may or may not have for such events further the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate the contamination may adversely affect our ability to borrow against develop sell or rent the affected property in addition some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination 

certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials acms into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of apartment communities for personal injury associated with acms in connection with the ownership direct or indirect operation management and development of our communities the company could be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and costs related to injuries of persons and property 

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property the company carries certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk as to its properties however such coverage is not fully available for all properties and as to those properties for which limited coverage is fully available it may not apply to certain claims arising from known conditions present on those properties in general in connection with the ownership operation financing management and development of its communities the company may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities the company may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to third persons and damage to their property 

properties which we intend to acquire undergo a preacquisition phase i environmental site assessment before acquisition intended to afford the company protection against socalled “owner liability” under the primary federal environmental law as well as further environmental assessment which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling except where conditions warranting such further assessment are identified and seller’s consent is obtained while such assessments are conducted in accordance with applicable “appropriate inquiry standards no assurance can be given that all environmental conditions present will be discovered or that the full nature and extent of those conditions which are discovered will be adequately ascertained and quantified 

in connection with our ownership operation and development of communities from time to time we undertake remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants including contaminants in soil groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings the company does so under appropriate environmental regulatory requirements with the objective of obtaining regulatory closure or a no further action determination that will allow for future use development and sale of any impacted community 

mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time although the occurrence of mold at multifamily and other structures and the need to remediate such mold is not a new phenomenon there has been increased awareness in recent years that certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects including allergic or other reactions the company has adopted policies for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold when it is detected and to minimize any impact mold might have on residents of the property the company believes its mold policies and proactive response to address any known existence reduces its risk of loss from these cases however no assurance can be provided that the company has identified and responded to all mold occurrences 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as proposition 65 requiring that clear and reasonable warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke although the company has sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements the company cannot assure you that the company will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 65 

methane gas is a naturallyoccurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas particularly in the southern california coastal areas methane is a nontoxic gas but can be flammable and can be explosive at sufficient concentrations when in confined spaces and exposed to an ignition source naturallyoccurring methane gas is regulated at the state and federal level as a greenhouse gas but is not otherwise regulated as a hazardous substance however some local governments such as the county of los angeles have imposed requirements that new buildings install detection andor venting systems in areas where naturally occurring methane gas is known to be located and can accumulate methane gas is also associated with certain industrial activities such as former municipal waste landfills radon is also a naturallyoccurring gas that is found below the surface the company cannot assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane or radon gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas 

we cannot assure you that costs or liabilities incurred as a result of environmental matters will not affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders or that such costs or liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations provided however the company is unaware of any pending or threatened alleged claim resulting from such matters which would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

adverse changes in laws may affect the companys liability relating to its properties and its operations  increases in real estate taxes and income service and transfer taxes cannot always be passed through to residents or users in the form of higher rents and may adversely affect the companys cash available for distribution and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders and pay amounts due on its debt similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions as well as changes in laws affecting development construction and safety requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on the company and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders and pay amounts due on our debt for example the california statute known as sb375 provides that in order to reduce greenhouse emissions there should be regional planning to coordinate housing needs with regional transportation such planning could lead to restrictions on property development that adversely affect the company in addition future enactment of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing as well as any lawsuits against the company arising from such rent control or other laws may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs 

risks related to our indebtedness and financings 

capital and credit market conditions may affect the company’s access to sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could negatively affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition   in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to the company may be adversely affected the company’s current balance sheet the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a diversified bank group access to the public and private placement debt markets and secured debt financing providers such as fannie mae and freddie mac provides some insulation from volatile capital markets 

historically the company has utilized borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future beginning in 2011 the company has primarily utilized unsecured debt and has repaid secured debt at or near their respective maturity and has placed less reliance on agency mortgage debt financing the administration and lawmakers have proposed potential options for the future of agency mortgage finance in the us that could involve the phase out of fannie mae and freddie mac while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector should they discontinue doing so have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government it would reduce our access to debt capital and could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance existing indebtedness at competitive rates and it may adversely affect our ability to sell assets in general to the extent that the company’s access to capital and credit is at a higher cost than the company has experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing without corresponding change to investment cap rates the company’s ability to make acquisitions develop communities obtain new financing and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates could adversely impact the companys financial standing and related credit rating 

debt financing has inherent risks   at december 31 2014 the company had approximately 51 billion  of indebtedness including 6606 million  of variable rate indebtedness of which 2250 million  is subject to interest rate swaps effectively fixing the interest rate and 1532 million  is subject to interest rate cap protection the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the following 

 

the company may not be able to refinance its indebtedness this indebtedness includes secured mortgages and the communities subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the lender this could cause the company to lose income and asset value the company may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 

debt financing of communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service debt  where appropriate the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on the company’s investments and to provide for additional investments that the company could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the communities will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” the company may obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all of the communities these mortgages may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations working capital and capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent our cash flow is subject to general economic industry regional financial competitive operating legislative regulatory taxation and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

as of december 31 2014 the company had 68 consolidated communities encumbered by debt with respect to the 68 communities encumbered by debt all of them are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those communities the holders of this indebtedness will have rights with respect to these communities and lenders may seek foreclosure of communities which would reduce the company’s income and net asset value and its ability to service other debt 

rising interest rates may affect the company’s costs of capital and financing activities and results of operation interest rates could increase which could result in higher interest expense on the company’s variable rate indebtedness or increase interest rates when refinancing maturing fixed rate debt prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company’s ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with positive economic returns on investment and the company’s ability to refinance existing borrowings 

interest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses  periodically the company has entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates and may continue to do so although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged the company may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the company to increased credit risks in order to 

minimize counterparty credit risk the company enters into hedging arrangements only with financial institutions that have a current rating of a or higher 

a downgrade in the companys investment grade credit rating could materially and adversely affect its business and financial condition  the company plans to manage its operations to maintain its investment grade credit rating with a capital structure consistent with its current profile but there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain its current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on the company’s cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on its financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

changes in the company’s financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness  the company’s organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a limit on debt financing consistent with the existing covenants required to maintain the company’s unsecured line of credit bank facility unsecured debt and senior unsecured bonds if the company changed this policy the company could incur more debt which could result in a default under the companys existing indebtedness thereby causing such indebtedness to become due and payable and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations such increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the communities

the price per share of the company’s stock may fluctuate significantly the market price per share of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including without limitation 

 

many of the factors listed above are beyond the company’s control these factors may cause the market price of shares of the company’s common stock to decline regardless of the company’s financial condition results of operations or business prospects 

the company’s future issuances of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities could adversely affect the market price of the company’s common stock  in order to finance the company’s acquisition and development activities the company has issued and sold common stock preferred stock and convertible debt securities for example during the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  the company issued 30 million  excluding shares issued in connection with the bre merger and 09 million  shares of common stock for 5340 million  and 1384 million  net of fees and commissions respectively the company may in the future sell further shares of common stock including pursuant to its equity distribution programs with cantor fitzgerald  co barclays capital inc bmo capital markets corp bnp paribas securities corp citigroup global markets inc jefferies llc jefferies jp morgan securities llc jp morgan liquidnet inc mitsubishi ufj securities usa inc and ubs securities llc ubs 

in 2014 the company filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec allowing the company to sell an undetermined number of equity and debt securities as defined in the prospectus future sales of common stock preferred stock or convertible 

debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock   

the company’s joint ventures and joint ownership of communities and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the company’s ability to control such communities and partial interests  instead of purchasing and developing apartment communities directly the company has invested and may continue to invest in joint ventures joint venture partners often have shared control over the development and operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company’s business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to the company’s instructions or requests or its policies or objectives consequently a joint venture partners’ actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives the company may be unable to take action without its joint venture partners’ approval or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without its consent a joint venture partner might fail to approve decisions that are in the company’s best interest should a joint venture partner become bankrupt the company could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities in some instances the company and the joint venture partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause the company to sell its interest or acquire a partner’s interest at a time when the company otherwise would have not have initiated such a transaction 

from time to time the company through the operating partnership invests in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing financing or managing real property in certain circumstances the operating partnership’s interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership’s objectives the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity the company may also incur losses if any guarantees or indemnifications were made by the company the company also owns properties indirectly under downreit structures the company has and in the future may enter into transactions that could require the company to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets into downreits joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within the company’s control occur although the company plans to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on sale pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the code the company can provide no assurance that the company will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they could have a material impact on its financial position 

the company’s chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest  the company’s chairman george m marcus is not an employee of the company and is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest mr marcus owns interests in various other real estaterelated businesses and investments he is the chairman of the marcus  millichap company “mmc” which is a parent company of a diversified group of real estate service investment and development firms mr marcus is also the cochairman of marcus  millichap inc “mmi” and mr marcus owns a controlling interest in mmi mmi is a national brokerage firm listed on the nyse that underwent its initial public offering in 2013

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock as of december 31 2014  george m marcus the chairman of the company’s board of directors wholly or partially owned 16 million shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships indirectly held common shares and assuming exercise of all vested options respectively mr marcus currently does not have majority control over the company however he currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant 

corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all the company’s stockholders

the maryland business combination law may not allow certain transactions between the company and its affiliates to proceed without compliance with such law under maryland law “business combinations” between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these business combinations include a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities an interested stockholder is defined as any person and certain affiliates of such person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock the law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions this means that the transaction must be approved by at least 

 

the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under maryland law as permitted by the statute the board of directors of the company irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by the company george m marcus who is the chairman of the company and mmc or any entity owned or controlled by mr marcus and mmc consequently the fiveyear prohibition and supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to any business combination between the company mr marcus or mmc as a result the company may in the future enter into business combinations with mr marcus and mmc without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland business combination act 

antitakeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement charter bylaws and certain provisions of maryland law could delay defer or prevent a change in control while the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on the company’s ability to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company’s stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of the company’s stockholders the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership the company cannot without first obtaining the consent of a majorityininterest of the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of the company’s general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity such limitations on the company’s ability to act may result in the company’s being precluded from taking action that the board of directors believes is in the best interests of the company’s stockholders

the company’s charter contains other provisions that may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of the company’s stockholders the charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

the maryland general corporation law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed to be “control shares” under the maryland general corporation law “control shares” are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporation law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the company’s stockholders

a breach of the company’s privacy or information security systems could materially adversely affect the company’s business and financial condition the protection of customer employee and company data is critically important to the company our business requires us including some of our vendors to use and store personally identifiable and other sensitive information of its customers and employees the collection and use of personally identifiable information is governed by federal and state laws and regulations privacy and information security laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another compliance with all such laws and regulations may increase the company’s operating costs and adversely impact the company’s ability to market the company’s properties and services 

the security measures put in place by the company and such vendors cannot provide absolute security and the company and our vendors information technology infrastructure may be vulnerable to criminal cyberattacks or data security incidents due to employee error malfeasance or other vulnerabilities any such incident could compromise the company’s or such vendors networks and the information stored by the company or such vendors could be accessed misused publicly disclosed corrupted lost or stolen resulting in fraud including wire fraud related to company assets or other harm moreover if a data security incident or breach affects the company’s systems or such vendors systems or results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information the company’s reputation and brand could be materially damaged and the company may be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability which could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

in the third quarter of 2014 the company discovered and reported that certain of its computer networks containing personal and proprietary information were compromised by a cyberintrusion based on information from our forensic investigation the company has confirmed that evidence exists of exfiltration of data on company systems the precise nature of the data has not yet been identified and the company does not presently have any evidence that data belonging to the company has been misused 

after detecting unusual activity the company took immediate steps to assess and contain the intrusion and secure its systems the company retained independent forensic computer experts to analyze the impacted data systems and is consulting with law enforcement the investigation into this cyberintrusion is ongoing and the company is working as quickly as possible to identify whether any employee or resident data may be at risk as a precaution the company has purchased identity protection services for all current residents and employees 

as described in note 16 commitments and contingencies of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k on december 19 2014 a punitive class action was filed against the company in the us district court for the northern district of california entitled foster v essex property trust inc  alleging that the company failed to properly secure the personallyidentifying information of its residents at this point the company is unable to predict the developments in outcome of andor economic andor other consequences of such pending litigation or future litigation or predict the developments in outcome of andor other consequences arising as a result of any potential government inquiries related to this matter 

the company has recorded 16 million  and 28 million  in cyberintrusion expenses in the fourth quarter and year ended december 31 2014  respectively including legal fees investigative fees costs of communications with the company’s residents and employees and identity protection services the company expects to incur additional costs as investigation and remediation efforts continue such costs are not currently estimable but could be material to the company’s future operating results 

privacy and information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks in light of this recent network intrusion we have dedicated additional company resources to strengthening the security of the company’s computer systems in the future the company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company’s information security measures andor to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities despite these steps there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer a similar data security incident in the future that unauthorized parties will not gain access to sensitive data stored on the company’s systems or that any such incident will be discovered in a timely manner further the 

techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data are often novel or change frequently accordingly the company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures 

employee theft or fraud could result in loss certain of our employees have access to or signature authority with respect to bank accounts or other company assets which exposes us to the risk of fraud or theft in addition certain employees have access to key information technology it infrastructure and to tenant and other information that is commercially valuable should any employee compromise our it systems or misappropriate tenant or other information we could incur losses including significant financial or reputational harm from which full recovery cannot be assured we also may not have insurance that covers any losses in full or that covers losses from particular criminal acts as of december 31 2014  potential liabilities for theft or fraud are not quantifiable and an estimate of possible loss cannot be made 

the company may incur general uninsured losses  the company purchases general liability and all risk property including loss of rent insurance coverage for each of its communities the company also purchases limited earthquake terrorism environmental and flood insurance there are certain types of losses which may not be covered or could exceed coverage limits the insurance programs are subject to deductibles and selfinsured retentions in varying amounts the company utilizes a wholly owned insurance subsidiary pacific western insurance llc pwi to selfinsure certain earthquake and all risk losses as of december 31 2014 pwi has cash and marketable securities of approximately 576 million  and is consolidated in the companys financial statements 

all the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity the company evaluates its financial loss exposure to seismic events by using actuarial loss models developed by the insurance industry and property vulnerability based on structural evaluations of seismic consultants the company manages this exposure where considered appropriate desirable and costeffective by upgrading properties to increase their resistance to forces caused by seismic events by considering available funds and coverages provided by pwi andor by purchasing seismic insurance since 2013 the company accessed the commercial marketplace to purchase earthquake insurance for certain highdensity properties 

in addition the company carries other types of insurance coverage related to a variety of risks and exposures including cyberattack 

based on market conditions the company may change or potentially eliminate insurance coverages or increase levels of selfinsurance further we cannot assure you that the company will not incur losses which could be material due to uninsured risks deductibles and selfinsured retentions andor losses in excess of coverage limits 

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material in the event of a substantial loss insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full replacement cost of the company’s lost investment or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the company’s ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed   

risk of accidental death due to fire natural disasters or other hazards  the accidental death of persons living in our communities due to fire natural disasters or other hazards could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations our insurance coverage may not cover all losses associated with such events and we may experience difficulty marketing communities where such any such events have occurred which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

any material weaknesses identified in the companys internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on the company’s stock price section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires the company to evaluate and report on its internal control over financial reporting if the company identifies one or more material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting the company could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports which in turn could have an adverse effect on the company’s stock price 

changes in the system for establishing us accounting standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations   accounting for public companies in the united states has historically been conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the united states “gaap” gaap is established by the financial accounting standards board the “fasb” an independent body whose standards are recognized by the sec as authoritative for publicly held companies the international accounting standards board the “iasb” is a londonbased independent board 

established in 2001 and charged with the development of international financial reporting standards “ifrs” ifrs generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in europe and in developed nations around the world 

we are monitoring the sec’s activity with respect to the proposed adoption of ifrs by united states public companies it is unclear at this time how the sec will propose that gaap and ifrs be harmonized if the proposed change is adopted in addition switching to a new method of accounting and adopting ifrs would be a complex undertaking we would potentially need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of ifrs since these are new endeavors and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately to be adopted are not now known the magnitude of costs associated with this conversion are uncertain 

we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ifrs on our financial position and results of operations such evaluation cannot be completed however without more clarity regarding the specific ifrs standards that would potentially be adopted until there is more certainty with respect to the ifrs standards that could be adopted prospective investors should consider that our conversion to ifrs could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations 

tax risks 

there are various us tax risks in connection with an investment in the company and in essex portfolio lp  the company has elected to be taxed as a reit under the code the company’s qualification as a reit i requires it to satisfy numerous annual and quarterly requirements including income tests and asset tests established under highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and ii involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company’s control although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enable it to qualify as a reit it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions any of which could have retroactive effect could adversely affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect the company’s stockholders if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year the company would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on the company’s taxable income at corporate rates and the company would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income the company would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders and the company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders 

  

the company has established several taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” the trss must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its trss do not adversely affect its reit qualification it cannot provide assurances that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore the company may be subject to a 100 penalty tax or its trss may be denied deductions to the extent dealings between the company and its trss are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature the company intends that its dealings with its trss will be on an arm’s length basis no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not challenge such dealings 

  

from time to time the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties under the code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since the company acquires properties for investment purposes it does not believe that its occasional transfers or disposals of property should be treated as prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by the company are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then the company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to it from the prohibited transaction and the company’s ability to retain proceeds from real property sales may be jeopardized income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect the company’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes therefore no assurances can be given that the company will be able to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit if the company transferred or disposed of property in a transaction treated as a prohibited transaction 

  

dividends paid by reits to us stockholders that are individuals trusts or estates are generally not eligible for the reduced tax rate applicable to qualified dividends received from nonreit corporations the maximum rate on qualified dividends is currently 238 us individual trust or estate stockholders who receive dividends from a reit that are not designated as 

capital gain dividends will be taxed on such dividends at ordinary income rates at a current maximum rate of 434 this may cause investors to view reit investments to be less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock in reits including the company’s stock 

nonus investors that invest in the company should be aware of the following us federal income tax considerations in connection with such investment first distributions by the company from its current and accumulated earnings and profits are subject to a 30 us withholding tax in the hands of nonus investors unless the 30 may be reduced by an applicable income tax treaty such distributions may also be subject to a 30 withholding tax under the “foreign account tax compliance act” “fatca” unless a nonus investor complies with certain requirements prescribed by fatca second distributions by the company that are attributable to gains from dispositions of us real property “capital gain dividends” will be treated as income that is effectively connected with a us trade or business in the hands of a nonus investor such that a nonus investor will have us federal income tax payment and filing obligations with respect to capital gain dividends furthermore capital gain dividends are subject to an additional 30 “branch profits tax” which may be reduced by an applicable income tax treaty in the hands of a nonus investor that is a corporation third any gain derived by a nonus investor on a disposition of such investor’s stock in the company will subject such investor to us federal income tax payment and filing requirements if the company were not treated as a domesticallycontrolled reit a reit is “domestically controlled” if less than 50 of the reit’s capital stock by value has been owned directly or indirectly by persons who are not qualifying us persons during a continuous fiveyear period ending on the date of disposition or if shorter during the entire period of the reit’s existence the company believes that it is a domesticallycontrolled reit but no assurances can be given in this regard even if the company were not a domesticallycontrolled reit however under a special exception nonus investors should not have us federal income tax payment and filing obligations on a disposition of their stock in the company if i they did not own more than 5 of such stock at any time during the oneyear period ending on the date of the disposition and ii the company’s stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market located in the united states nonus investors should consult with their independent advisors as to the above us tax considerations and other us tax consequences of an investment in the company’s stock in light of their particular circumstances 

the company believes that its operating partnership essex portfolio lp will continue to qualify to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes as a partnership essex portfolio lp is not subject to us federal income tax on its income instead each of its partners will be required to pay tax on such partner’s allocable share of the income of essex portfolio lp no assurances can be given however that the internal revenue service will not challenge essex portfolio lp’s status as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge if the internal revenue service were successful in treating essex portfolio lp as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes the company could fail to meet the income tests andor the asset tests applicable to reits and accordingly cease to qualify as a reit also the failure of essex portfolio lp to qualify as a partnership would cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for distribution to its partners

 item 2 properties 

the company’s portfolio as of december 31 2014  including communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures but excluding communities underlying preferred equity investments was comprised of 239  apartment communities comprising 57455  apartment units of which 27125  units are located in southern california 17604  units are located in the san francisco bay area and 12174  units are located in the seattle metropolitan area the company’s apartment communities accounted for 990  of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2014  

occupancy rates 

financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue when calculating actual rents for occupied units and market rents for vacant units delinquencies and concessions are not taken into account total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units with occupied units valued at contractual 

rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company’s calculation of financial occupancy market rates are determined using a variety of factors such as effective rental rates at the property based on recently signed leases and asking rates for comparable properties in the market the recently signed effective rates at the property are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant units the company then increases or decreases these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community’s market the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market 

for communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while a community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy 

communities 

the company’s communities are primarily suburban gardenstyle communities and town homes comprising multiple clusters of two and threestory buildings situated on three to fifteen acres of land as of december 31 2014  the company’s communities include 163  gardenstyle 72  midrise and 4  highrise communities the communities have an average of approximately 240  units with a mix of studio one two and some threebedroom units a wide variety of amenities are available at the company’s communities including covered parking fireplaces swimming pools clubhouses with fitness facilities volleyball and playground areas and tennis courts

results of operations 

comparison of year ended december 31 2014  to the year ended december 31 2013   

the company’s average financial occupancies for the company’s stabilized apartment communities or “ 2014  2013  sameproperties” stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  increased 10 basis points to 962  in 2014  from 961  in 2013  financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue actual rental revenue represents contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents 

we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate 

market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant units the company may increase or decrease these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community’s market the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company’s calculation of financial occupancy 

the company does not take into account delinquency and concessions to calculate actual rent for occupied units and market rents for vacant units the calculation of financial occupancy compares contractual rates for occupied units to estimated market rents for unoccupied units thus the calculation compares the gross value of all apartment units excluding delinquency and concessions for apartment communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while an apartment community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy 

the regional breakdown of the company’s 2014  2013  sameproperty portfolio for financial occupancy for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  is as follows 



the following table provides a breakdown of revenue amounts including the revenues attributable to 2014  2013  sameproperties

2014  2013  nonsame property revenues  increased by 368 million  or 852  to 800 million  in 2014  compared to 432 million  to 2013  the increase was primarily due to revenue generated from twelve communities acquired or consolidated since january 1 2013 

management and other fees from affiliates  increased 20 million  or 287  to 93 million  in 2014  compared to 73 million  in 2013  the increase is primarily due to the asset and property management fees earned from the wesco iii wesco iv and bexaew coinvestments formed during 2014 the increase in management fees was offset by a reduction of 12 million in asset and property management fees from the sale of two fund ii communities in 2014 

property operating expenses excluding real estate taxes  increased 643 million  or 463  in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to properties acquired in connection with the bre merger and six other communities in 2014 2014  2013  sameproperty operating expenses excluding real estate taxes increased by 38 million  or 30  in 2014  compared to 2013  due mainly to a 16 million increase in repairs and maintenance and a 13 million increase in utilities expense

depreciation and amortization expense  increased by 1682 million  or 874  in 2014  compared to 2013  due to the acquisition of bre and six other communities the increase is due to the capitalization of approximately 3131 million  in additions to rental properties through 2014  including 1528 million  spent on acquisition of and additions to real estate under development 814 million  spent on redevelopment and 789 million  spent on capital expenditures on rental properties approximately 1220 million  in additions to rental properties were capitalized for 2013  including 178 million  spent on acquisition of and additions to real estate under development 473 million  spent on redevelopment and 569 million  spent on capital expenditures on rental properties

interest expense increased 480 million  or 412  in 2014   primarily due to additional debt assumed as part of the bre merger offset by an increase in capitalized interest from development and redevelopment projects 

equity income from coinvestments  decreased by 160 million  to 399 million  in 2014  compared to 559 million  in 2013  the decrease was primarily due to the company’s share of the gain on the sale of two fund ii communities of 66 million promote income of 106 million and income from early redemption of preferred equity investments of 53 million in 2014 compared to the companys share of gain on the sale of five fund ii communities of 388 million net of internal dispositions costs in 2013

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities the company defines critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require the companys management to exercise their most difficult subjective and complex judgments the company’s critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas i accounting for business combinations ii consolidation under applicable accounting standards of various entities iii assessing the carrying values of the companys real estate and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates and iv internal cost capitalization the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 

the company accounts for its business combinations including the merger and other acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with asc 80510 business combinations which requires the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities to be recorded at fair value with excess purchase price if any recorded to goodwill the company must make significant assumptions in determining the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired and consideration transferred the use of different assumptions in estimating the fair value could affect the measurement and timing of recognition of acquired assets and liabilities and related expenses 

the consideration transferred in a business combination is generally measured at fair value for debt assumed by the company the fair value is determined using estimated market interest rates for debt with comparable terms in place at the time of the acquisition for equity issued by the company the fair value is generally based on the fair value of the company’s equity interests at the date of issuance 

the fair value of the tangible assets which principally includes land and building is determined first by valuing the property as a whole as if it were vacant using stabilized net operating income and market specific capitalization rates the fair value of the land and building is then recorded based on its estimated fair value 

in calculating the fair value of identified intangible assets of an acquired property the inplace leases are valued based on inplace rent rates and estimated time and cost to lease a unit 

the initial purchase accounting is based on the company’s preliminary assessment which may differ when additional information becomes available subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase accounting if any are made within the measurement period which will be finalized within one year of the acquisition date 

the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie if such an entity is a vie then the company performs an analysis to determine who is the primary beneficiary if the company is the primary beneficiary then the entity is consolidated the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 

the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 

further the company evaluates whether its coinvestments are other than temporarily impaired and if so records an impairment loss equal to the excess of the coinvestments carrying value over its estimated fair value 

the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs including interest and real estate taxes incurred during development and redevelopment activities interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period included in capitalized costs are management’s accounting estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with the companys development and redevelopment activities indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development including accounting legal fees and various corporate and community onsite costs that clearly relate to projects under development 

the company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 

net operating income “noi” 

sameproperty net operating income “noi” is considered by management to be an important supplemental performance measure to earnings from operations included in the company’s consolidated statements of operations the presentation of sameproperty noi assists with the presentation of the company’s operations prior to the allocation of depreciation and any corporatelevel or financingrelated costs noi reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easy comparison of the operating performance of individual communities or groups of communities prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures with varying marginal impacts to overhead by acquiring real estate and noi is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets the company defines sameproperty noi as sameproperty revenue less sameproperty operating expenses

insurance

the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the communities there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as for example losses from terrorism or earthquakes for which the company does not have insurance coverage substantially all of the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity the company has established a wholly owned insurance subsidiary pacific western insurance llc “pwi” through pwi the company is selfinsured as it relates to earthquake related losses additionally since january 2008 pwi has provided property and casualty insurance coverage for the first 50 million of the company’s property level insurance claims per incident as of december 31 2013 pwi has cash and marketable securities of approximately 40 million these assets are consolidated in the company’s financial statements beginning in 2013 the company has obtained limited third party seismic insurance on selected assets in which it holds an ownership interest in

the company believes it has a proactive approach to its potential earthquake losses the company utilizes thirdparty seismic consultants for its acquisitions and may perform seismic upgrades to those acquisitions that are determined to have a higher level of potential loss from an earthquake the company utilizes thirdparty loss models to help to determine its exposure the majority of the communities are lower density gardenstyle apartments which may be less susceptible to material earthquake damage the company will continue to monitor thirdparty earthquake insurance pricing and conditions and may consider obtaining thirdparty coverage if it deems it cost effective  

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material

competition

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities condominiums and singlefamily homes if the demand for the company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing housing rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations

the company faces competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities some competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the company this competition may result in increased costs of apartment communities the company acquires and or develops

working capital

the company believes that cash flows generated by its operations existing cash and marketable securities balances availability under existing lines of credit access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of its reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2014 as noted above in connection with the bre merger the company obtained committed financing up to 10 billion which is available if needed to fund the cash portion of the purchase price the company is exploring several alternatives to fund the cash needs of the transaction including asset sales joint ventures or new financing

the timing source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment which can affect the company’s plans for acquisitions dispositions development and redevelopment activities

 item 1a risk factors

 

for purposes of this section the term “stockholders” means the holders of shares of essex property trust inc’s common stock and preferred stock set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to essex property trust inc’s stockholders and essex portfolio lp’s unit holders you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating our company our properties and our business

 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause the our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results

 

risk factors relating to the proposed merger with bre

 

the exchange ratio and the cash consideration will not be adjusted in the event of any change in the stock prices of either essex or bre    upon the consummation of the merger each outstanding share of bre common stock will be converted automatically into the right to receive 02971 shares of essex common stock with cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares plus 1233 in cash without interest each subject to certain adjustments provided for in the merger agreement the exchange ratio of 02971 and cash consideration will not be adjusted for changes in the market prices of either shares of essex common stock or shares of bre common stock changes in the market price of shares of essex common stock prior to the merger will affect the market value of the merger consideration that will be paid to bre shareholders upon completion of the merger stock price changes may result from a variety of factors many of which are beyond the control of essex and bre including the following factors

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the market price of shares of essex common stock at the closing of the merger may vary from its price on the date the merger agreement was executed and thereafter as a result the market value of the merger consideration represented by the exchange ratio will also vary

 

therefore while the number of shares of essex common stock to be issued per share of bre common stock is fixed essex stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the merger consideration that will be paid to bre stockholders upon completion of the merger

 

essex stockholders and unitholders of the operating partnership will be diluted by the merger    the merger will dilute the ownership position of essex stockholders and unitholders of the operating partnership upon completion of the merger we estimate that continuing essex stockholders will own approximately 62 of the issued and outstanding shares of combined company common stock and former bre stockholders will own approximately 38 of the issued and outstanding common stock of the combined company consequently essex stockholders and unitholders of the operating partnership as a general matter will have less influence over the management and policies of the combined company after the effective time of the merger than they currently exercise over the management and policies of essex

 

failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock prices and the future business and financial results of essex    if the merger is not completed the ongoing business of essex could be adversely affected and essex will be subject to a variety of risks associated with the failure to complete the merger including the following

 

 

 

 

 

if the merger is not completed these risks could materially affect the business financial results and stock prices of essex

 

the pendency of the merger could adversely affect the business and operations of essex    prior to the effective time of the merger some tenants or vendors of essex may delay or defer decisions which could negatively affect the revenues earnings cash flows and expenses of essex regardless of whether the merger is completed similarly current and prospective employees of essex may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the merger which may materially adversely affect the ability of essex to attract and retain key personnel during the pendency of the merger in addition due to operating restrictions in the merger agreement essex may be unable during the pendency of the merger to pursue strategic transactions undertake significant capital projects undertake certain significant financing transactions and otherwise pursue other actions even if such actions would prove beneficial

there can be no assurance that essex will be able to secure the financing necessary to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at all    in connection with the merger essex has obtained commitments for up to 10 billion in a senior unsecured bridge loan facility to finance the cash portion of the merger consideration in addition essex is exploring additional alternatives to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration including through existing unsecured credit facilities asset sales joint ventures or other financing arrangements however essex has not entered into a definitive agreement for the debt financing nor has it secured alternative financing nor has it entered into a definitive agreement for the potential asset sales the “asset sale” in connection with the merger there can be no assurance that essex will be able to secure financing to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at all if essex is unable to secure such financing essex will nonetheless be required to close the merger under the terms of the merger agreement in addition the bridge loan facility expires on april 18 2014 with a right to extend up to an additional 30 days in certain circumstances whereas the merger agreement may not be terminable until june 17 2014

 

risk factors relating to the combined company following the merger

 

if the proposed merger closes we will face various additional risks if the proposed merger closes the combined company the combination of essex and bre pursuant to the merger will face various additional risks including among others the following

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these risks could adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company

 

if the proposed merger closes there will be additional risks relating to an investment in our common stock the results of operations of the combined company as well as the market price of the common stock of the combined company after the merger may be affected by other factors in addition to those currently affecting essex’s results of operations and the market prices of essex common stock such factors include

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

any of these factors could adversely affect essexs common stock price and financial results accordingly the historical market prices and financial results of essex may not be indicative of these matters for the combined company after the merger

 

the risks set forth in the foregoing risk factors titled if the proposed merger closes we will face various additional risks and if the proposed merger closes there will be additional risks relating to an investment in our common stock  and additional risks associated with the merger are described in more detail under the heading “risk factors” in the joint proxy statementprospectus contained in our registration statement on form s4 which was filed with the sec on january 29 2014 neither the form s4 nor the joint proxy statementprospectus contained therein is incorporated by reference or constitutes a part of this annual report on form 10k  

 

in connection with the announcement of the merger agreement three lawsuits have been filed and are pending as of february 10 2014 seeking among other things to enjoin the merger and an injunction or other adverse ruling being entered in this lawsuit may prevent the merger from being effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe if at all

 

since the announcement of the merger agreement on december 19 2013 three putative class action and shareholder derivative actions have been filed on behalf of alleged bre stockholders andor bre itself in the circuit court for baltimore city maryland under the following captions sutton v bre properties inc et al no 24c13008425 filed december 23 2013 applegate v bre properties inc et al no 24c1400002 filed december 30 2013 and lee v bre properties inc et al no 24c1400046  filed january 3 2014

 

all of these complaints name as defendants bre the bre board essex and merger sub and allege that the bre board breached its fiduciary duties to bre’s stockholders andor to bre itself and that the merger involves an unfair price an inadequate sales process and unreasonable deal protection devices that purportedly preclude competing offers the complaints further allege that essex merger sub and in some cases bre aided and abetted those alleged breaches of duty the complaints seek injunctive relief including enjoining or rescinding the merger and an award of other unspecified attorneys’ and other fees and costs in addition to other relief

 

on february 7 2014 plaintiffs filed identical amended complaints in the three pending actions the amended complaints add allegations that disclosures regarding the proposed merger in the joint proxy statementprospectus filed with the sec on january 29 2014 are inadequate

 

we cannot assure you as to the outcome of these or any similar future lawsuits including the costs associated with defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation or settlement of these claims if the plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the parties from completing the merger on the agreedupon terms such an injunction may prevent the completion of the merger in the expected time frame or may prevent it from being completed altogether whether or not the plaintiffs’ claims are successful this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect the operation of the businesses of bre and essex

risks relating to essex property trust inc regardless of whether

the proposed merger with bre is consummated

 

the company depends on its key personnel    the company’s success depends on its ability to attract and retain executive officers senior officers and company managers there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of any of the company’s key personnel could have an adverse effect on the company

 

capital and credit market conditions may affect the company’s access to sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could negatively affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition    in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to the company may be adversely affected the company’s strong balance sheet the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a bank group and access to the public debt and private placement markets and fannie mae and freddie mac secured debt financing provides some insulation from volatile markets the company has benefited from borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac and there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future to the extent that the company’s access to capital and credit is at a higher cost than the company has experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing the company’s ability to make acquisitions develop communities obtain new financing and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates could be adversely impacted for the past two years the company has primarily issued unsecured debt and repaid secured debt when it has matured to place less reliance on mortgage debt financing

 

debt financing has inherent risks    at december 31 2013 the company had approximately 30 billion of indebtedness including 7370 million of variable rate indebtedness of which 3000 million is subject to interest rate swaps effectively fixing the interest rate and 1569 million is subject to interest rate protection agreements the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the following

 

 

 

 

 

 

the company may not be able to refinance its indebtedness this indebtedness includes secured mortgages and the communities subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the lender this could cause the company to lose income and asset value the company may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness

 

debt financing of communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service debt    where appropriate the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on the company’s investments and to provide for additional investments that the company could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the communities will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the company may obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all of the communities these mortgages may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized

 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations working capital and capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent our cash flow is subject to general economic industry regional financial competitive operating legislative regulatory taxation and other factors many of which are beyond our control

for communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while a community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy

results of operations

comparison of year ended december 31 2013 to the year ended december 31 2012

the company’s average financial occupancies for the company’s stabilized apartment communities or “20132012 sameproperties” stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 decreased 10 basis points to 962 in 2013 from 963 in 2012 financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue actual rental revenue represents contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate

market rates are determined using the recently signed effective rates on new leases at the property and are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant units the company may increase or decrease these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community’s market the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company’s calculation of financial occupancy

the company does not take into account delinquency and concessions to calculate actual rent for occupied units and market rents for vacant units the calculation of financial occupancy compares contractual rates for occupied units to estimated market rents for unoccupied units thus the calculation compares the gross value of all apartment units excluding delinquency and concessions for apartment communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while an apartment community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy

the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie if such an entity is a vie then the company performs an analysis to determine who is the primary beneficiary if the company is the primary beneficiary then the entity is consolidated the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures

the company believes it has a proactive approach to its potential earthquake losses the company utilizes thirdparty seismic consultants for its acquisitions and may perform seismic upgrades to those acquisitions that are determined to have a higher level of potential loss from an earthquake the company utilizes thirdparty loss models to help to determine its exposure the majority of the communities are lower density gardenstyle apartments which may be less susceptible to material earthquake damage the company will continue to monitor thirdparty earthquake insurance pricing and conditions and may consider obtaining thirdparty coverage if it deems it cost effective  

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities and singlefamily homes the communities also compete for residents with new and existing condominiums if the demand for the company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing housing rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse affect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

the company faces competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities some competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the company this competition may result in increased costs of apartment communities the company acquires and or develops 

  

  

working capital 

the company believes that cash flows generated by its operations existing cash and marketable securities balances availability under existing lines of credit access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of its reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2013 the timing source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment which can affect its plans for acquisitions dispositions development and redevelopment activities

 item 1a risk factors 

the company’s business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause the company’s actual results to vary materially from recent results or from the company’s anticipated future results 

the company depends on its key personnel the company’s success depends on its ability to attract and retain executive officers senior officers and company managers there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of any of the company’s key personnel could have an adverse effect on the company 

capital and credit market conditions may affect the company’s access to sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could negatively affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to the company may be adversely affected the company’s strong balance sheet the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a bank group and access to the private placement market and fannie mae and freddie mac secured debt financing provides some insulation from volatile markets the company has benefited from borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac and there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future to the extent that the company’s access to capital and credit is at a higher cost than the company has experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing the company’s ability to make acquisitions develop communities obtain new financing and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates could be adversely impacted for the past two years the company has primarily issued unsecured debt and repaid secured debt when it has matured to place less reliance on mortgage debt financing 

debt financing has inherent risks at december 31 2012 the company had approximately 282 billion of indebtedness including 6929 million of variable rate indebtedness of which 3000 million is subject to interest rate swaps effectively fixing the interest rate and 1878 million is subject to interest rate protection agreements the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

the company may not be able to refinance its indebtedness the communities subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the lender this could cause the company to lose income and asset value the company may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 

debt financing of communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service debt where appropriate the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on the company’s investments and to provide for additional investments that the company could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the communities will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the company may obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all of the communities these mortgages may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized 

our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations working capital and capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash in the future to a certain extent our cash flow is subject to general economic industry regional financial competitive operating legislative regulatory and other factors many of which are beyond our control 

as of december 31 2012 the company had 55 of its 139 consolidated communities encumbered by debt with respect to the 55 communities encumbered by debt all of them are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those communities the holders of this indebtedness will have rights with respect to these communities and lenders may seek foreclosure of communities which would reduce the company’s income and net asset value 

  

 

rising interest rates may affect the company’s costs of capital and financing activities and results of operation interest rates could increase which could result in higher interest expense on the company’s variable rate indebtedness or increase interest rates when refinancing maturing fixed rate debt prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company’s ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with positive economic returns on investment and the company’s ability to refinance existing borrowings 

interest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses periodically the company has entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates and may continue to do so although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged the company may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the company to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk the company’s policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with financial institutions that have a current rating of a or higher 

bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain communities at december 31 2012 the company had approximately 2019 million of variable rate taxexempt financing this taxexempt financing provides for certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants the company expects to engage in taxexempt financings in the future the internal revenue code and rules and regulations thereunder impose various restrictions conditions and requirements in order to allow the noteholder to exclude interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue code also requires that at least 20 of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed a specified percentage generally 50 of the median income for the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development department of the federal government certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed communities if the company is required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and the company may be subject to additional contractual liability 

general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks if the communities do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected income from the communities may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as leases at the communities expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to the company income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws eg the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and tax laws real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore the company’s ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited 

national and regional economic environments can negatively impact the company’s operating results during recent years a confluence of factors has resulted in job losses turmoil and volatility in the capital markets and caused a national and global recession the companys forecast for the national economy assumes the return of growth with estimated gross domestic product growth of the national economy and the economies of the western states in the event of another recession the company could incur reduction in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising and turnover expenses 

inflationdeflation may affect rental rates and operating expenses substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses 

  

  

acquisitions of communities may fail to meet expectations  the company intends to continue to acquire apartment communities however there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet the company’s expectations the company’s estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that is necessary to allow the company to market an acquired apartment community as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate the company expects to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by the company the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the company’s existing stockholders if the company finances new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless the company obtains substitute financing the company may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development or such lines of credit may be not available on advantageous terms 

development and redevelopment activities may be delayed not completed andor not achieve expected results  the company pursues development and redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals which have no assurance of being received the company’s development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the company’s stockholders further the development and redevelopment of communities is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see the risk factor “ general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values ” 

the geographic concentration of the company’s communities and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact the company’s financial condition and operating results  the company generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 from the company’s communities concentrated in southern california los angeles orange santa barbara san diego and ventura counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area for the year ended december 31 2012 82 of the company’s rental revenues were generated from communities located in california this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations the economic condition of these markets could affect occupancy property revenues and expenses from the communities and their underlying asset values the financial results of major local employers also may impact the cash flow and value of certain of the communities this could have a negative impact on the company’s financial condition and operating results which could affect the company’s ability to pay expected dividends to its stockholders 

competition in the apartment community market may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for the company’s communities there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the communities are located if the demand for the company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing apartment communities rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations the company also faces competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities this competition may result in an increase in costs and prices of apartment communities that the company acquires andor develops 

  

  

the price per share of the company’s stock may fluctuate significantly the market price per share of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including without limitation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of the factors listed above are beyond the company’s control these factors may cause the market price of shares of the company’s common stock to decline regardless of the company’s financial condition results of operations or business prospects 

the company’s future issuances of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities could adversely affect the market price of the company’s common stock  in order to finance the company’s acquisition and development activities the company has issued and sold common stock preferred stock and convertible debt securities for example during 2012 and 2011 the company issued and sold 24 million and 25 million shares of common stock for 3577 million and 3239 million net of fees and commissions respectively the company may in the future sell further shares of common stock including pursuant to its equity distribution programs with cantor fitzgerald  co keybanc capital markets inc barclays capital inc bmo capital markets corp liquidnet inc and mitsubishi ufj securities usa inc and citigroup global markets inc in 2011 the company issued 2950000 shares of 7125 series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a price of 2500 per share for net proceeds of 712 million net of costs and original issuance discounts 

in 2010 the company filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec allowing the company to sell an undetermined number of equity and debt securities as defined in the prospectus future sales of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 

 

the indenture governing the notes which we issued in august 2012 contains restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility in august   2012 the company through the operating partnership issued 300 million of senior notes the operating partnership has also agreed to conduct an offer to exchange these senior notes for a new series of publicly registered notes the “exchange notes” with substantially identical terms the indenture which governs both the senior notes issued in august 2012 and the exchange notes contains financial and operating covenants that among other things   restrict our ability to take specific actions even if we believe them to be in our best interest including   restrictions on our ability to 

 

 

 

 

in addition the instruments governing our other unsecured indebtedness require us to meet specified financial covenants including covenants relating to net worth fixed charge coverage debt service coverage the amounts of total indebtedness and secured indebtedness leverage and certain investment limitations these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies our ability to comply with these provisions and those contained in the indenture governing the notes may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance changes in general business and economic conditions adverse regulatory developments or other events adversely impacting us the breach of any of these covenants including those contained in our indenture could result in a default under our indebtedness which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable if any of our indebtedness is accelerated we may not be able to repay it 

  

a downgrade in our investment grade credit rating could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition the company plans to manage its operations to maintain its investment grade credit rating with a capital structure consistent with its current profile but there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain its current credit ratings any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on the company’s cost and availability of capital which could in turn have a material adverse impact on its financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

the company’s chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest the company’s chairman george m marcus is not an employee of the company and is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest mr marcus owns interests in various other real estaterelated businesses and investments he is the chairman of the marcus  millichap company “tmmc” which is a holding company for certain real estate brokerage and services companies tmmc has an interest in pacific urban residential and summerhill homes companies that invest in apartment communities

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock  as of december 31 2012 george m marcus the chairman of the company’s board of directors wholly or partially owned 16 million shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of all vested options this represents approximately 44 of the outstanding shares of the company’s common stock mr marcus currently does not have majority control over the company however he currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all the company’s stockholders 

under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for any amendment of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with the company the company’s directors and executive officers including mr marcus have substantial influence on the company consequently their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders 

the voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock   essex currently has outstanding shares of 7125 series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock “series h preferred stock” in general the holders of the company’s outstanding shares of series h preferred stock do not have any voting rights however if full distributions are not made on outstanding series h preferred stock for six quarterly distributions periods the holders of series h preferred stock together with holders of other series of preferred stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred will have the right to elect two additional directors to serve on essex’s board of directors 

these voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for the current quarterly period on the series h preferred stock have been paid in full at that time the holders of the series h preferred stock are divested of these voting rights and the term of office of the directors so elected immediately terminates 

 

while any shares of the company’s series h preferred stock are outstanding the company may not without the consent of the holders of twothirds of the outstanding shares of series h preferred stock

the maryland business combination law may not allow certain transactions between the company and its affiliates to proceed without compliance with such law  under maryland law “business combinations” between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these business combinations include a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities an interested stockholder is defined as any person and certain affiliates of such person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock the law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions this means that the transaction must be approved by at least 

 

 

 

the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under maryland law as permitted by the statute the board of directors of the company irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by the company george m marcus who is the chairman of the company and tmmc or any entity owned or controlled by mr marcus and tmmc consequently the fiveyear prohibition and supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to any business combination between the company mr marcus or tmmc as a result the company may in the future enter into business combinations with mr marcus and tmmc without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland general corporation law 

antitakeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement charter bylaws and certain provisions of maryland law could delay defer or prevent a change in control  while the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on the company’s ability to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company’s stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of the company’s stockholders the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership the company cannot without first obtaining the consent of a majorityininterest of the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of the company’s general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity such limitations on the company’s ability to act may result in the company’s being precluded from taking action that the board of directors believes is in the best interests of the company’s stockholders as of december 31 2012 the limited partners held or controlled approximately 55 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership allowing such actions to be blocked by the limited partners 

the company’s charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other terms of such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock the company may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control such a transaction might involve a premium price for the company’s stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock also such a class of preferred stock could have dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders of common stock 

  

  

the company’s charter contains other provisions that may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of the company’s stockholders the charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

the maryland general corporations law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed to be “control shares” under the maryland general corporations law “control shares” are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the company’s stockholders 

the company’s charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of the company’s board of directors which in turn may delay defer or prevent a transaction including a change in control those provisions include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the company’s joint ventures and joint ownership of communities and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the company’s ability to control such communities and partial interests  instead of purchasing and developing apartment communities directly the company has invested and may continue to invest in joint ventures joint venture partners often have shared control over the development and operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company’s business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to the company’s instructions or requests or its policies or objectives consequently a joint venture partners’ actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives the company may be unable to take action without its joint venture partners’ approval or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without its consent should a joint venture partner become bankrupt the company could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities in some instances the company and the joint venture partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause the company to sell its interest or acquire a partner’s interest at a time when the company otherwise would have not have initiated such a transaction 

  

  

from time to time the company through the operating partnership invests in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing financing or managing real property in certain circumstances the operating partnership’s interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership’s objectives the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity the company may also incur losses if any guarantees were made by the company the company has and in the future may enter into transactions that could require the company to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets into joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within the company’s control occur although the company plans to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on sale pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the internal revenue code the company can provide no assurance that the company will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on its financial position

the company has almost no indemnification agreements from third parties for potential environmental cleanup costs at its communities the company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions or violations with respect to communities formerly owned by the company no assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of the communities reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of an apartment community did not create any material environmental condition not known to the company or that a material environmental condition does not exist as to any one or more of the communities the company has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described above 

  

  

the company may incur general uninsured losses the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the communities there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as for example losses from terrorism or earthquakes for which the company does not have insurance coverage substantially all of the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity in january 2007 the company canceled its then existing earthquake policy and established a wholly owned insurance subsidiary pacific western insurance llc “pwi” through pwi the company is selfinsured as it relates to earthquake related losses additionally since january 2008 pwi has provided property and casualty insurance coverage for the first 50 million of the company’s property level insurance claims per incident 

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material in the event of a substantial loss insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full replacement cost of the company’s lost investment or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the company’s ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed 

changes in real estate tax and other laws may adversely affect the company’s results of operations  generally the company does not directly pass through costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants the company also does not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on apartment communities or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated decrease in revenue or increase in expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

adverse changes in laws may affect our liability relating to our properties and our operations increases in real estate taxes and income service and transfer taxes cannot always be passed through to residents or users in the form of higher rents and may adversely affect our cash available for distribution and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions as well as changes in laws affecting development construction and safety requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt in addition future enactment of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs 

changes in the company’s financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a limit on debt financing consistent with the existing covenants required to maintain the company’s unsecured line of credit bank facility unsecured debt and senior unsecured bonds the company’s organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred if the company changed this policy the company could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on the company’s obligations and the obligations of the operating partnership and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations such increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the communities 

the company is subject to various tax risks  the company has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code the company’s qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company’s control although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enables it to qualify as a reit it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions any of which could have retroactive effect could adversely affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect the company’s stockholders if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year the company would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on the company’s taxable income at corporate rates and the company would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders in computing its taxable income the company may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders and the company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders even if the company continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on the company’s income and property 

  

  

the company has established several taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” despite its qualification as a reit the company’s trss must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its trss do not adversely affect its reit qualification it cannot provide assurance that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore it may be subject to a 100 penalty tax or its trss may be denied deductions to the extent its dealings with its trss are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature no assurances can be given that the company’s dealings with its trss will be arm’s length in nature 

from time to time the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since the company acquires properties for investment purposes it does not believe that its occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by the company are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then the company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to it from the prohibited transaction and the company’s ability to retain future gains on real property sales may be jeopardized income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect the company’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes therefore no assurances can be given that the company will be able to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 

the us federal tax rate on certain corporate dividends paid to certain individuals and other noncorporate taxpayers is at a reduced rate of 15 a rate of 20 applies to certain highincome individual taxpayers dividends paid by reits to individuals and other noncorporate stockholders are not eligible for the reduced 15 dividend rates this may cause investors to view reit investments to be less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock in reits including the company’s stock

 item 2 properties 

the company’s portfolio as of december 31 2012 including communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures but excluding communities underlying preferred equity investments was comprised of 163 apartment communities comprising 33468 apartment units of which 15444 units are located in southern california 10189 units are located in the san francisco bay area and 7835 units are located in the seattle metropolitan area the company’s apartment communities accounted for 984 of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 

occupancy rates 

the company’s average financial occupancies for the company’s stabilized communities or “20122011 sameproperties” stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 was unchanged at 963 for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue when calculating actual rents for occupied units and market rents for vacant units delinquencies and concessions are not taken into account total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company’s calculation of financial occupancy market rates are determined using a variety of factors such as effective rental rates at the property based on recently signed leases and asking rates for comparable properties in the market the recently signed effective rates at the property are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant units the company then increases or decreases these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community’s market the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market 

 

  

  

for communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while a community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy 

communities 

the company’s communities are primarily suburban gardenstyle communities and town homes comprising multiple clusters of two and threestory buildings situated on three to fifteen acres of land as of december 31 2012 the company’s communities include 117 gardenstyle 43 midrise and 3 highrise communities the communities have an average of approximately 206 units with a mix of studio one two and some threebedroom units a wide variety of amenities are available at the company’s communities including covered parking fireplaces swimming pools clubhouses with fitness facilities volleyball and playground areas and tennis courts

the company’s average financial occupancies for the company’s stabilized apartment communities or “20122011 sameproperties” stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 remained consistent at 963 for 2012 and 2011 financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue actual rental revenue represents contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate 

 

market rates are determined using a variety of factors such as effective rental rates at the property based on recently signed leases and asking rates for comparable properties in the market the recently signed effective rates at the property are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant units the company then increases or decreases these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community’s market the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company’s calculation of financial occupancy 

the company does not take into account delinquency and concessions to calculate actual rent for occupied units and market rents for vacant units the calculation of financial occupancy compares contractual rates for occupied units to estimated market rents for unoccupied units thus the calculation compares the gross value of all apartment units excluding delinquency and concessions for apartment communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while an apartment community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities the company defines critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require the companys management to exercise their most difficult subjective and complex judgments the company’s critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas i consolidation under applicable accounting standards of various entities ii assessing the carrying values of the companys real estate and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates and iii internal cost capitalization the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 

the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie if such an entity is a vie then the company performs an analysis to determine who is the primary beneficiary if the company is the primary beneficiary then the entity is consolidated the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 

the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties 

further the company evaluates whether its coinvestments have other than temporary impairment and if so records a write down 

the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs including interest and real estate taxes incurred during development and redevelopment activities interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period included in capitalized costs are management’s accounting estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with the companys development and redevelopment activities indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development including accounting legal fees and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under development 

 

  

 

the company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions

funds from operations ffo 

ffo is a financial measure that is commonly used in the reit industry the company presents funds from operations as a supplemental operating performance measure ffo is not used by the company nor should it be considered to be as an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of the company’s operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of the companys ability to fund its cash needs 

ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor does the company intend it to present a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance the company believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings further the company believes that its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 

 

  

 

in calculating ffo the company follows the definition for this measure published by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” which is a reit trade association the company believes that under the nareit ffo definition the two most significant adjustments made to net income are i the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and ii the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of previously depreciated properties essex agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

management has consistently applied the nareit definition of ffo to all periods presented however other reits in calculating ffo may vary from the nareit definition for this measure and thus their disclosure of ffo may not be comparable to the company’s calculation 

the following table sets forth the company’s calculation of ffo and core ffo for 2012  in thousands

the company’s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows management has estimated that the fair value of the company’s 213 billion and 177 billion of fixed rate debt at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively to be 224 billion and 188 billion management has estimated the fair value of the company’s 6929 million and 5937 million of variable rate debt at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively is 6717 million and 5723 million based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable and variable rate demand notes compared to those available in the marketplace  in thousands 

 

 

1 1878 million subject to interest rate caps 

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2012 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result the company’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations and hedging strategies would depend on the exposures that arise during the period

the company believes it has a proactive approach to its potential earthquake losses the company utilizes thirdparty seismic consultants for its acquisitions and may perform seismic upgrades to those acquisitions that are determined to have a higher level of potential loss from an earthquake the company utilizes thirdparty loss models to help to determine its exposure the majority of the communities are lower density gardenstyle apartments which may be less susceptible to material earthquake damage the company will continue to monitor thirdparty earthquake insurance pricing and conditions and may consider obtaining thirdparty coverage if it deems it cost effective

competition 

  

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities and singlefamily homes the communities also compete for residents with new and existing condominiums if the demand for the company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing housing rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse affect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company faces competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities some competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the company this competition may result in increased costs of apartment communities the company acquires and or develops 

  

working capital 

  

the company believes that cash flows generated by its operations existing cash and marketable securities balances availability under existing lines of credit access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of its reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2012 the timing source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment which can affect its plans for acquisitions dispositions development and redevelopment activities

other matters 

  

certain policies of the company 

  

the company intends to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject it to regulation under the investment company act of 1940 the company has in the past five years and may in the future i issue securities senior to its common stock ii fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and iii offer shares of common stock andor units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for property acquisitions the company from time to time acquires partnership interests in partnerships and joint ventures either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries of the company when such entities’ underlying assets are real estate 

  

the company invests primarily in apartment communities that are located in predominantly coastal markets within southern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area the company currently intends to continue to invest in apartment communities in such regions however these practices may be reviewed and modified periodically by management 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

the company’s business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause the company’s actual results to vary materially from recent results or from the company’s anticipated future results 

  

  

  

the company depends on its key personnel the company’s success depends on its ability to attract and retain executive officers senior officers and company managers there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of any of the company’s key personnel could have an adverse effect on the company 

 

capital and credit market conditions may affect the company’s access to sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could negatively affect the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility the amounts sources and cost of capital available to the company may be adversely affected the company’s strong balance sheet the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a bank group and access to the private placement market and fannie mae and freddie mac secured debt financing provides some insulation from volatile markets the company has benefited from borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac and there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future to the extent that the company’s access to capital and credit is at a higher cost than the company has experienced in recent years reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or a lower stock price for equity financing the company’s ability to make acquisitions develop communities obtain new financing and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates could be adversely impacted 

  

debt financing has inherent risks at december 31 2011 the company had approximately 236 billion of indebtedness including 5937 million of variable rate indebtedness of which 1500 million is subject to interest rate swaps effectively fixing the interest rate and 1878 million is subject to interest rate protection agreements the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

the company may not be able to refinance its indebtedness the communities subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the lender this could cause the company to lose income and asset value the company may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 

debt financing of communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service debt where appropriate the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on the company’s investments and to provide for additional investments that the company could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the communities will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code the company may obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all of the communities these mortgages may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized 

as of december 31 2011 the company had 68 of its 138 consolidated communities encumbered by debt with respect to the 68 communities encumbered by debt 61 of them are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those communities with respect to the remaining 7 communities there is a crosscollateralized mortgage secured by the 7 communities the holders of this indebtedness will have rights with respect to these communities and lenders may seek foreclosure of communities which would reduce the company’s income and net asset value 

rising interest rates may affect the company’s costs of capital and financing activities and results of operation interest rates could increase rapidly which could result in higher interest expense on the company’s variable rate indebtedness prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company’s ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with positive economic returns on investment and the company’s ability to refinance existing borrowings 

interest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses periodically the company has entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates and may continue to do so although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged the company may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the company to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk the company’s policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with financial institutions that have a current rating of a or higher 

  

  

bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain communities at december 31 2011 the company had approximately 2027 million of variable rate taxexempt financing relating to the following apartment communities inglenook court wandering creek boulevard camarillo oaks fountain park anchor village hidden valley and belmont station this taxexempt financing subjects these communities to certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants the company expects to engage in taxexempt financings in the future the internal revenue code and rules and regulations thereunder impose various restrictions conditions and requirements excluding interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue code also requires that at least 20 of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed a specified percentage generally 50 of the median income for the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development department of the federal government in addition to federal requirements certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed communities if the company is required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and the company may be subject to additional contractual liability

many of the factors listed above are beyond the company’s control these factors may cause the market price of shares of the company’s common stock to decline regardless of the company’s financial condition results of operations or business prospects 

the company’s future issuances of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities could adversely affect the market price of the company’s common stock  in order to finance the company’s acquisition and development activities the company has issued and sold common stock preferred stock and convertible debt securities for example during 2011 and 2010 the company issued and sold 25 million and 24 million shares of common stock for 3239 million and 2514 million net of fees and commissions respectively the company may in the future sell further shares of common stock including pursuant to its equity distribution programs with cantor fitzgerald  co keybanc capital markets inc barclays capital inc bmo capital markets corp liquidnet inc and mitsubishi ufj securities usa inc in 2011 the company issued 2950000 shares of 7125 series h cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a price of 2500 per share for net proceeds of 712 million net of costs and original issuance discounts 

in 2010 the company filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec allowing the company to sell an undetermined number of equity and debt securities as defined in the prospectus future sales of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 

the company’s chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest the company’s chairman george m marcus is not an employee of the company and is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest mr marcus owns interests in various other real estaterelated businesses and investments he is the chairman of the marcus  millichap company “tmmc” which is a holding company for certain real estate brokerage and services companies tmmc has an interest in pacific property company a company that invests in apartment communities

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock  as of december 31 2011 george m marcus the chairman of the company’s board of directors wholly or partially owned 16 million shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of all vested options this represents approximately 44 of the outstanding shares of the company’s common stock mr marcus currently does not have majority control over the company however he currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all the company’s stockholders 

  

under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for any amendment of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with the company the company’s directors and executive officers including mr marcus have substantial influence on the company consequently their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders

the maryland business combination law may not allow certain transactions between the company and its affiliates to proceed without compliance with such law  under maryland law “business combinations” between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these business combinations include a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities an interested stockholder is defined as any person and certain affiliates of such person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock the law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions this means that the transaction must be approved by at least 

  

 

 

the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under maryland law as permitted by the statute the board of directors of the company irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by the company george m marcus who is the chairman of the company and tmmc or any entity owned or controlled by mr marcus and tmmc consequently the fiveyear prohibition and supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to any business combination between the company mr marcus or tmmc as a result the company may in the future enter into business combinations with mr marcus and tmmc without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland general corporation law 

  

  

antitakeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement charter bylaws and certain provisions of maryland law could delay defer or prevent a change in control    while the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on the company’s ability to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the company’s stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of the company’s stockholders the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership the company cannot without first obtaining the consent of a majorityininterest of the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of the company’s general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity such limitations on the company’s ability to act may result in the company’s being precluded from taking action that the board of directors believes is in the best interests of the company’s stockholders as of december 31 2011 the limited partners held or controlled approximately 62 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership allowing such actions to be blocked by the limited partners

the company’s charter contains other provisions that may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of the company’s stockholders the charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

  

the maryland general corporations law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed to be “control shares” under the maryland general corporations law “control shares” are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the company’s stockholders 

  

the company’s charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of the company’s board of directors which in turn may delay defer or prevent a transaction including a change in control those provisions include  

  

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

the company’s joint ventures and joint ownership of communities and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the company’s ability to control such communities and partial interests    instead of purchasing and developing apartment communities directly the company has invested and may continue to invest in joint ventures joint venture partners often have shared control over the development and operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company’s business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to the company’s instructions or requests or its policies or objectives consequently a joint venture partners’ actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives the company may be unable to take action without its joint venture partners’ approval or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without its consent should a joint venture partner become bankrupt the company could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities in some instances the company and the joint venture partner may each have the right to trigger a buysell arrangement which could cause the company to sell its interest or acquire a partner’s interest at a time when the company otherwise would have not have initiated such a transaction 

  

from time to time the company through the operating partnership invests in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing financing or managing real property in certain circumstances the operating partnership’s interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership’s objectives the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity the company may also incur losses if any guarantees were made by the company the company has and in the future may enter into transactions that could require the company to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets into joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within the company’s control occur although the company plans to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on sale pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the internal revenue code the company can provide no assurance that the company will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on its financial position

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property the company carries certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk the company has conducted environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater contamination at certain communities such contamination at certain of these apartment communities was reported to have migrated onsite from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations the former industrial users of the communities were identified as the source of contamination the environmental studies noted that certain communities are located adjacent to or possibly down gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination the lateral limits of which may extend onto such apartment communities the environmental studies also noted that at certain of these apartment communities contamination existed because of the presence of underground fuel storage tanks which have been removed in general in connection with the ownership operation financing management and development of apartment communities the company may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities the company may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to persons and property 

  

  

there have been a number of lawsuits in recent years against owners and managers of apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements the company has been sued for mold related matters and has settled some but not all of such matters insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates the company has however purchased pollution liability insurance which includes some coverage for mold the company has adopted policies for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold when it is detected and to minimize any impact mold might have on residents of the property the company believes its mold policies and proactive response to address any known existence reduces its risk of loss from these cases there can be no assurance that the company has identified and responded to all mold occurrences liabilities resulting from such mold related matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows as of december 31 2011 potential liabilities for mold and other environmental liabilities are not considered probable or the loss cannot be quantified or estimated

methane gas is a naturallyoccurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas particularly in the southern california coastal areas methane is a nontoxic gas but can be ignitable in confined spaces although naturallyoccurring methane gas is not regulated at the state or federal level however some local governments such as the county of los angeles have imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems in areas where methane gas is known to be located methane gas is also associated with certain industrial activities such as former municipal waste landfills radon is also a naturallyoccurring gas that is found below the surface the company cannot assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane or radon gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas 

the company has almost no indemnification agreements from third parties for potential environmental cleanup costs at its communities the company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions or violations with respect to communities formerly owned by the company no assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of the communities reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of an apartment community did not create any material environmental condition not known to the company or that a material environmental condition does not exist as to any one or more of the communities the company has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described above 

the company may incur general uninsured losses the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the communities there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as for example losses from terrorism or earthquakes for which the company does not have insurance coverage substantially all of the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity in january 2007 the company canceled its then existing earthquake policy and established a wholly owned insurance subsidiary pacific western insurance llc “pwi” through pwi the company is selfinsured as it relates to earthquake related losses additionally since january 2008 pwi has provided property and casualty insurance coverage for the first 50 million of the company’s property level insurance claims per incident 

  

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material in the event of a substantial loss insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full replacement cost of the company’s lost investment or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the company’s ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed 

  

  

  

changes in real estate tax and other laws may adversely affect the company’s results of operations  generally the company does not directly pass through costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants the company also does not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on apartment communities or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated decrease in revenue or increase in expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

  

adverse changes in laws may affect our liability relating to our properties and our operations 

increases in real estate taxes and income service and transfer taxes cannot always be passed through to residents or users in the form of higher rents and may adversely affect our cash available for distribution and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt similarly changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions as well as changes in laws affecting development construction and safety requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt in addition future enactment of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs 

  

changes in the company’s financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness  the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a limit on debt financing consistent with the existing covenants required to maintain the company’s unsecured line of credit bank facility and unsecured term loan the company’s organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred if the company changed this policy the company could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on the company’s obligations and the obligations of the operating partnership and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations such increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the communities 

  

the company is subject to various tax risks   the company has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code the company’s qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company’s control although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enables it to qualify as a reit it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions any of which could have retroactive effect could adversely affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect the company’s stockholders if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year the company would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on the company’s taxable income at corporate rates and the company would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders in computing its taxable income the company may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders and the company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders even if the company continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on the company’s income and property 

  

the company has established several taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” despite its qualification as a reit the company’s trss must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its trss do not adversely affect its reit qualification it cannot provide assurance that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore it may be subject to a 100 penalty tax or its trss may be denied deductions to the extent its dealings with its trss are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature no assurances can be given that the company’s dealings with its trss will be arm’s length in nature 

  

  

from time to time the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since the company acquires properties for investment purposes it does not believe that its occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by the company are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then the company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to it from the prohibited transaction and the company’s ability to retain future gains on real property sales may be jeopardized income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect the company’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes therefore no assurances can be given that the company will be able to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 

the us federal tax rate on certain corporate dividends paid to individuals and other noncorporate taxpayers is at a reduced rate of 15 until december 31 2012 it is uncertain whether this reduced rate will be continued beyond the scheduled expiration date dividends paid by reits to individuals and other noncorporate stockholders are not eligible for the reduced 15 rate this may cause investors to view reit investments to be less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock in reits including the company’s stock

 item 2 properties 

the company’s portfolio as of december 31 2011 including communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures but excluding communities underlying preferred equity investments was comprised of 159 apartment communities comprising 32753 apartment units of which 15114 units are located in southern california 10001 units are located in the san francisco bay area and 7638 units are located in the seattle metropolitan area the company’s apartment communities accounted for 975 of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 

occupancy rates 

the company’s average financial occupancies for the company’s stabilized communities or “20112010 sameproperties” stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 decreased 50 basis points to 964 for the year ended december 31 2011 from 969 for the year ended december 31 2010 financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue when calculating actual rents for occupied units and market rents for vacant units delinquencies and concessions are not taken into account total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company’s calculation of financial occupancy market rates are determined using a variety of factors such as effective rental rates at the property based on recently signed leases and asking rates for comparable properties in the market the recently signed effective rates at the property are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant units the company then increases or decreases these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community’s market the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market 

 

  

  

for communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while a community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy

southern california region  as of december 31 2011 this region represented 48 of the company’s consolidated apartment units during the year ended december 31 2011 revenues for “20112010 sameproperties” as defined below or “sameproperty revenues” increased 27 in 2011 as compared to 2010 in 2012 the company expects new residential supply excluding santa barbara and riverside counties of 5400 multifamily and 5100 single family homes which represents a total new supply of 02 and 01 of existing stock respectively the company assumes an increase of 78800 jobs or 12 and an increase in rental income of 30 to 50 in 2012 

  

northern california region  as of december 31 2011 this region represented 30 of the company’s consolidated apartment units sameproperty revenues increased 57 in 2011 as compared to 2010 in 2012 the company expects new residential supply of 3000 multifamily and 2200 single family homes which represents a total new supply of 03 and 02 respectively of existing stock the company assumes an increase of 48000 jobs or 17 and an increase in rental income of 70 to 90 in 2012 

  

seattle metro region  as of december 31 2011 this region represented 22 of the company’s consolidated apartment units sameproperty revenues increased 46 in 2011 as compared to 2010 in 2012 the company expects new residential supply of 1800 multifamily and 3400 single family homes which represents a total new supply of 05 of existing stock the company assumes an increase of 25000 jobs or 18 and an increase in rental income of 70 to 90 in 2012 

the company expects 2012 sameproperty revenues to increase between 5 and 7 compared to 2011 results as renewal leases and new leases are signed at higher rents than 2011 during 2012 the company expects sameproperty financial occupancy to be consistent with 2011 at 964 thus 2012 revenues will increase 5 to 7 due to a similar increase in scheduled rent sameproperty operating expenses are expected to increase from 11 in 2011 to a range of 2 and 3 in 2012 finally sameproperty net operating income “noi” which is defined as sameproperty revenues less sameproperty operating expenses is expected to increase from 55 for 2011 to a range of 7 to 9 in 2012 

the company’s consolidated communities are as follows 

 

coinvestments including fund ii and wesco i communities essex skyline at macarthur place and preferred equity coinvestment communities are not included in the table presented above for both years 

  

  

results of operations 

comparison of year ended december 31 2011 to the year ended december 31 2010 

the company’s average financial occupancies for the company’s stabilized apartment communities or “20112010 sameproperties” stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 decreased 50 basis points to 964 in 2011 from 969 in 2010 financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue actual rental revenue represents contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate 

  

market rates are determined using a variety of factors such as effective rental rates at the property based on recently signed leases and asking rates for comparable properties in the market the recently signed effective rates at the property are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant units the company then increases or decreases these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment community’s market the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company’s calculation of financial occupancy 

  

the company does not take into account delinquency and concessions to calculate actual rent for occupied units and market rents for vacant units the calculation of financial occupancy compares contractual rates for occupied units to estimated market rents for unoccupied units thus the calculation compares the gross value of all apartment units excluding delinquency and concessions for apartment communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while an apartment community is in the leaseup phase the company’s primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy

20112010 nonsame property revenues revenue increased 452 million in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the acquisition of twelve operating properties since january 1 2010 three communities were acquired in 2011 comprised of delano the bernard and 1000 kiely and nine communities were acquired in 2010 comprised of santee court courtyard off main corbella at juanita bay anavia 416 on broadway 101 san fernando the commons bella villagio and elevation the increase in nonsame property revenue is also attributable to eight development communities via santee village bellerive muse allegro axis 2300 fourth  u and joule and the acquisition of the santa clara retail center

the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie if such an entity is a vie then the company performs an analysis to determine who is the primary beneficiary if the company is the primary beneficiary then the entity is consolidated the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 

  

the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties further the company evaluates whether its coinvestments have other than temporary impairment and if so records a write down 

  

the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs including interest and real estate taxes incurred during development and redevelopment activities interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period included in capitalized costs are management’s accounting estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with the companys development and redevelopment activities indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development including accounting legal fees and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under development

funds from operations ffo 

  

ffo is a financial measure that is commonly used in the reit industry the company presents funds from operations as a supplemental operating performance measure ffo is not used by the company nor should it be considered to be as an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of the company’s operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of the companys ability to fund its cash needs 

  

ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor does the company intend it to present a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance the company believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings further the company believes that its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 

  

in calculating ffo the company follows the definition for this measure published by the national association of reits “nareit” which is a reit trade association the company believes that under the nareit ffo definition the two most significant adjustments made to net income are i the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and ii the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of previously depreciated properties essex agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

  

 

  

  

  

 

 

  

management has consistently applied the nareit definition of ffo to all periods presented however other reits in calculating ffo may vary from the nareit definition for this measure and thus their disclosure of ffo may not be comparable to the company’s calculation

insurance 

the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the communities insured risks for comprehensive liabilities covers claims in excess of 25000 per incident and property casualty insurance covers losses in excess of a 50 million deductible per incident there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as for example losses from terrorism and earthquakes for which the company does not have insurance substantially all of the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquakes 

the company believes it has a proactive approach to its potential earthquake losses the company utilizes thirdparty seismic consultants for its acquisitions and may perform seismic upgrades to those acquisitions that are determined to have a higher level of potential loss from an earthquake the company utilizes thirdparty loss models to help to determine its exposure the majority of the communities are lower density gardenstyle apartments which may be less susceptible to material earthquake damage the company will continue to monitor thirdparty earthquake insurance pricing and conditions and may consider obtaining thirdparty coverage if it deems it cost effective  

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the companys communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities and singlefamily homes the communities also compete for residents with new and existing condominiums if the demand for the companys communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing housing on a more costeffective basis rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse affect on the companys financial condition and results of operations 

the company faces competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities some competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the company this competition may result in increased costs of apartment communities the company acquires and or develops 

  

working capital 

the company believes that cash flows generated by its operations existing cash and marketable securities balances availability under existing lines of credit access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of its reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2011 the timing source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment which can affect its plans for acquisitions dispositions development and redevelopment activities

 ite m 1a risk factors 

the companys business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause the companys actual results to vary materially from recent results or from the companys anticipated future results 

the company depends on its key personnel the companys success depends on its ability to attract and retain executive officers senior officers and company managers there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of any of the companys key personnel could have an adverse effect on the company 

capital and credit market conditions may affect the companys access to sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could negatively affect the companys business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in recent years   the companys financing activities have been impacted by the instability and tightening in the credit markets which has led to an increase in spreads and pricing of secured debt unsecured debt and lines of credit the companys strong balance sheet the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a bank group and the secured line of credit with freddie mac and access to fannie mae and freddie mac secured debt financing have provided some insulation to the company from the turmoil experienced by many other real estate companies the company has benefited from borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac and there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future continued turmoil in the capital markets and further job losses could negatively impact the companys ability to make acquisitions develop communities obtain new financing and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates 

  

debt financing has inherent risks at december 31 2010 the company had approximately 226 billion of indebtedness including 6952 million of variable rate indebtedness of which 1919 million is subject to interest rate protection agreements the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

the company may not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness or lines of credit the communities subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the lender this could cause the company to lose income and asset value the company may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 

debt financing of communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service debt where appropriate the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on the companys investments and to provide for additional investments that the company could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the communities will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code the company may obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all of the communities these mortgages may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized 

as of december 31 2010 the company had 81 of its 132 consolidated communities encumbered by debt of the 81 communities 63 are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those communities with respect to the remaining 18 communities there are 2 crosscollateralized mortgages secured by 11 and 7 communities respectively the holders of this indebtedness will have rights with respect to these communities and lenders may seek foreclosure of communities which would reduce the companys income and net asset value 

rising interest rates may affect the companys costs of capital and financing activities and results of operation interest rates could increase rapidly which could result in higher interest expense on the companys variable rate indebtedness prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the companys ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with positive economic returns on investment and the companys ability to refinance existing borrowings 

interest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses periodically the company has entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates and may continue to do so although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to the company if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged the company may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the company to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk the companys policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with arated financial institutions 

bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain communities at december 31 2010 the company had approximately 2133 million of variable rate taxexempt financing relating to the following apartment communities inglenook court wandering creek boulevard huntington breakers camarillo oaks fountain park anchor village hidden valley and belmont station this taxexempt financing subjects these communities to certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants the company expects to engage in taxexempt financings in the future the internal revenue code and rules and regulations thereunder impose various restrictions conditions and requirements excluding interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue code also requires that at least 20 of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed a specified percentage generally 50 of the median income for the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development department of the federal government in addition to federal requirements certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed communities if the company is required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and the company may be subject to additional contractual liability 

  

general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred if the communities do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected income from the communities may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as leases at the communities expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to the company income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws eg the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and tax laws real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore the companys ability to vary its portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited 

national and regional economic environments can negatively impact the companys operating results during recent years a confluence of factors has resulted in job losses turmoil and volatility in the capital markets and caused a national and global recession the companys forecast for the national economy assumes the return of growth with estimated gross domestic product growth of the national economy and the economies of the western states in the event of another recession the company could incur continued reduction in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising and turnover expenses 

inflationdeflation may affect rental rates and operating expenses substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses 

acquisitions of communities may fail to meet expectations  the company intends to continue to acquire apartment communities however there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet the companys expectations the companys estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that is necessary to allow the company to market an acquired apartment community as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate the company expects to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by the company the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the companys existing stockholders if the company finances new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless the company obtains substitute financing the company may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development or such lines of credit may be not available on advantageous terms 

  

development and redevelopment activities may be delayed not completed andor not achieve expected results  the company pursues development and redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals which have no assurance of being received the companys development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the companys stockholders further the development and redevelopment of communities is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see the risk factor  general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values  

the geographic concentration of the companys communities and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact the companys financial condition and operating results  the company generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 from the companys communities concentrated in southern california los angeles orange santa barbara san diego and ventura counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area for the year ended december 31 2010 81 of the companys rental revenues were generated from communities located in california this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations the economic condition of these markets could affect occupancy property revenues and expenses from the communities and their underlying asset values the financial results of major local employers also may impact the cash flow and value of certain of the communities this could have a negative impact on the companys financial condition and operating results which could affect the companys ability to pay expected dividends to its stockholders 

competition in the apartment community market may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for the companys communities there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the companys communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the communities are located if the demand for the companys communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing apartment communities on a more costeffective basis rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse affect on the companys financial condition and results of operations the company also faces competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities this competition may result in an increase in costs and prices of apartment communities that the company acquires andor develops 

the price per share of the companys stock may fluctuate significantly the market price per share of the companys common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including without limitation 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

many of the factors listed above are beyond the companys control these factors may cause the market price of shares of the companys common stock to decline regardless of the companys financial condition results of operations or business prospects 

the companys future issuances of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities could adversely affect the market price of the companys common stock  in order to finance the companys acquisition and development activities the company has issued and sold common stock preferred stock and convertible debt securities for example during 2010 and 2009 the company issued and sold 24 million and 27 million shares of common stock for 2514 million and 1985 million net of fees and commissions respectively the company may in the future sell further shares of common stock including pursuant to its equity distribution programs with cantor fitzgerald  co keybanc capital markets inc barclays capital inc bmo capital markets corp liquidnet inc and mitsubishi ufj securities usa inc 

in 2010 the company filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec allowing the company to sell an undetermined number of equity and debt securities as defined in the prospectus future sales of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 

the companys chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest the companys chairman george m marcus is not an employee of the company and is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest mr marcus owns interests in various other real estaterelated businesses and investments he is the chairman of the marcus  millichap company tmmc which is a holding company for certain real estate brokerage and services companies tmmc has an interest in pacific property company a company that invests in apartment communities 

mr marcus has agreed not to divulge any information that may be received by him in his capacity as chairman of the company to any of his affiliated companies and that he will abstain his vote on any and all resolutions by the company board of directors regarding any proposed acquisition andor development of an apartment community where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of his affiliated companies notwithstanding this agreement mr marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with the company in acquiring andor developing apartment communities which competition may be detrimental to the company in addition due to such potential competition for real estate investments mr marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with the company which may be detrimental to the interests of the companys stockholders 

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock  as of december 31 2010 george m marcus the chairman of the companys board of directors wholly or partially owned 16 million shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of all vested options this represents approximately 47 of the outstanding shares of the companys common stock mr marcus currently does not have majority control over the company however he currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all the companys stockholders 

under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for any amendment of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with the company the companys directors and executive officers including mr marcus have substantial influence on the company consequently their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders 

  

the voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock   essex currently has outstanding shares of 78125 series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock series f preferred stock also under certain circumstances the operating partnerships series b preferred units as defined in the second amended and restated partnership agreement for the operating partnership are convertible into shares of series b preferred stock of essex in general the holders of the companys outstanding shares of preferred stock do not have any voting rights however if full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock for six quarterly distributions periods the holders of preferred stock who have not received distributions voting together as a single class will have the right to elect two additional directors to serve on the companys board of directors 

these voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have been paid in full at that time the holders of the preferred stock are divested of these voting rights and the term and office of the directors so elected immediately terminates while any shares of the companys preferred stock are outstanding the company may not without the consent of the holders of twothirds of the outstanding shares of each series of preferred stock each voting separately as a single class 

 

 

 

 

 

these voting rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of the companys common stock 

the redemption rights of the series b preferred units and series f preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of the companys common stock upon the occurrence of one of the following events the terms of the operating partnerships series b preferred units require it to redeem all of such units and the terms of the companys series f preferred stock provide the holders of the majority of the outstanding series f preferred stock the right to require the company to redeem all of such stock 

 

 

 

 

the aggregate redemption price of the series b preferred units would be 80 million and the aggregate redemption price of the series f preferred stock would be 25 million plus in each case any accumulated distributions 

these redemption rights may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of holders of common stock further these redemption rights might trigger situations where the company needs to conserve its cash reserves in which event such redemption might adversely affect the company and its common holders 

the maryland business combination law may not allow certain transactions between the company and its affiliates to proceed without compliance with such law  under maryland law business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these business combinations include a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities an interested stockholder is defined as any person and certain affiliates of such person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock the law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions this means that the transaction must be approved by at least 

 

 

 

  

the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under maryland law as permitted by the statute the board of directors of the company irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by the company george m marcus who is the chairman of the company and tmmc or any entity owned or controlled by mr marcus and tmmc consequently the fiveyear prohibition and supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to any business combination between the company mr marcus or tmmc as a result the company may in the future enter into business combinations with mr marcus and tmmc without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland general corporation law 

antitakeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement charter bylaws and certain provisions of maryland law could delay defer or prevent a change in control  while the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on the companys ability to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the companys stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of the companys stockholders the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership the company cannot without first obtaining the consent of a majorityininterest of the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of the companys general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity such limitations on the companys ability to act may result in the companys being precluded from taking action that the board of directors believes is in the best interests of the companys stockholders as of december 31 2010 the limited partners held or controlled approximately 66 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership allowing such actions to be blocked by the limited partners 

the companys charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other terms of such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock the company may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control such a transaction might involve a premium price for the companys stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock also such a class of preferred stock could have dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders of common stock 

the companys charter contains other provisions that may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of the companys stockholders the charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

  

the maryland general corporations law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed to be control shares under the maryland general corporations law control shares are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the companys stockholders 

the companys charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of the companys board of directors which in turn may delay defer or prevent a transaction including a change in control those provisions include 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the companys joint ventures and joint ownership of communities and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the companys ability to control such communities and partial interests  instead of purchasing apartment communities directly the company has invested and may continue to invest in joint ventures joint venture partners often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the companys business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to the companys instructions or requests or its policies or objectives consequently a joint venture partners actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives the company may be unable to take action without its joint venture partners approval or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without its consent should a joint venture partner become bankrupt the company could become liable for such partners share of joint venture liabilities 

from time to time the company through the operating partnership invests in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing financing or managing real property in certain circumstances the operating partnerships interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnerships ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnerships objectives the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity the company has and in the future may enter into transactions that could require the company to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets into joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within the companys control occur although the company plans to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on sale pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the internal revenue code the company can provide no assurance that the company will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on its financial position

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property the company carries certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk the company has conducted environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater contamination at certain communities such contamination at certain of these apartment communities was reported to have migrated onsite from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations the former industrial users of the communities were identified as the source of contamination the environmental studies noted that certain communities are located adjacent to possible down gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination the lateral limits of which may extend onto such apartment communities the environmental studies also noted that at certain of these apartment communities contamination existed because of the presence of underground fuel storage tanks which have been removed in general in connection with the ownership operation financing management and development of apartment communities the company may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities the company may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to persons and property 

there have been a number of lawsuits in recent years against owners and managers of apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements the company has been sued for mold related matters and has settled some but not all of such matters insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates the company has however purchased pollution liability insurance which includes some coverage for mold the company has adopted policies for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold when it is detected and to minimize any impact mold might have on residents of the property the company believes its mold policies and proactive response to address any known existence reduces its risk of loss from these cases there can be no assurances that the company has identified and responded to all mold occurrences liabilities resulting from such mold related matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations or cash flows as of december 31 2010 potential liabilities for mold and other environmental liabilities are not considered probable or the loss cannot be quantified or estimated

methane gas is a naturallyoccurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas particularly in the southern california coastal areas methane is a nontoxic gas but can be ignitable in confined spaces although naturallyoccurring methane gas is not regulated at the state or federal level however some local governments such as the county of los angeles have imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems in areas where methane gas is known to be located methane gas is also associated with certain industrial activities such as former municipal waste landfills radon is also a naturallyoccurring gas that is found below the surface the company cannot assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane or radon gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas 

the company has almost no indemnification agreements from third parties for potential environmental cleanup costs at its communities the company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions or violations with respect to communities formerly owned by the company no assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of the communities reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of an apartment community did not create any material environmental condition not known to the company or that a material environmental condition does not exist as to any one or more of the communities the company has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described above 

the company may incur general uninsured losses the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the communities there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as for example losses for terrorism or earthquake for which the company does not have insurance coverage substantially all of the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity in january 2007 the company canceled its then existing earthquake policy and established a wholly owned insurance subsidiary pacific western insurance llc pwi through pwi the company is selfinsured as it relates to earthquake related losses additionally since january 2008 pwi has provided property and casualty insurance coverage for the first 50 million of the companys property level insurance claims per incident 

  

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material in the event of a substantial loss insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full replacement cost of the companys lost investment or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the companys ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed 

changes in real estate tax and other laws may adversely affect the companys results of operations  generally the company does not directly pass through costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants the company also does not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on apartment communities or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated decrease in revenue or increase in expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

changes in the companys financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a limit on debt financing consistent with the existing covenants required to maintain the companys unsecured line of credit bank facility the companys organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred if the company changed this policy the company could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on the companys obligations and the obligations of the operating partnership and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect the companys financial condition and results of operations such increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the communities 

the company is subject to various tax risks  the company has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code the companys qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the companys control although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enables it to qualify as a reit it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions any of which could have retroactive effect could adversely affect the companys ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect the companys stockholders if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year the company would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on the companys taxable income at corporate rates and the company would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders in computing its taxable income the company may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders and the company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders even if the company continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on the companys income and property 

the company has established several taxable reit subsidiaries trss despite its qualification as a reit the companys trss must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its trss do not adversely affect its reit qualification it cannot provide assurance that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore it may be subject to a 100 penalty tax or its trss may be denied deductions to the extent its dealings with its trss are not deemed to be arms length in nature no assurances can be given that the companys dealings with its trss will be arms length in nature 

  

from time to time the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since the company acquires properties for investment purposes it does not believe that its occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by the company are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then the company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to it from the prohibited transaction and the companys ability to retain future gains on real property sales may be jeopardized income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect the companys ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes therefore no assurances can be given that the company will be able to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 

the us federal tax rate on certain corporate dividends paid to individuals and other noncorporate taxpayers is at a reduced rate of 15 until december 31 2012 it is uncertain whether this reduced rate will be continued beyond the scheduled expiration date dividends paid by reits to individuals and other noncorporate stockholders are not eligible for the reduced 15 rate however this may cause investors to view reit investments to be less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock in reits including the companys stock

the companys portfolio as of december 31 2010 including communities owned by fund ii was comprised of 147 apartment communities comprising 30072 apartment units of which 14173 units are located in southern california 9271 units are located in the san francisco bay area and 6628 units are located in the seattle metropolitan area the companys apartment communities accounted for 939 of the companys revenues for the year ended december 31 2010 

occupancy rates 

the companys average financial occupancies for the companys stabilized apartment communities or 20102009 sameproperties stabilized properties consolidated by the company for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 remained consistent at 970 for 2010 and 2009 financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue when calculating actual rents for occupied units and market rents for vacant units delinquencies and concessions are not taken into account total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents the company believes that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the companys calculation of financial occupancy market rates are determined using a variety of factors such as effective rental rates at the property based on recently signed leases and asking rates for comparable properties in the market the recently signed effective rates at the property are used as the starting point in the determination of the market rates of vacant units the company then increases or decreases these rates based on the supply and demand in the apartment communitys market the company will check the reasonableness of these rents based on its position within the market and compare the rents against the asking rents by comparable properties in the market 

  

for apartment communities that are development properties in leaseup without stabilized occupancy figures the company believes the physical occupancy rate is the appropriate performance metric while an apartment community is in the leaseup phase the companys primary motivation is to stabilize the property which may entail the use of rent concessions and other incentives and thus financial occupancy which is based on contractual revenue is not considered the best metric to quantify occupancy 

apartment communities

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities the company defines critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require the companys management to exercise their most difficult subjective and complex judgments the companys critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas i consolidation under applicable accounting standards of various entities ii assessing the carrying values of the companys real estate and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates and iii internal cost capitalization the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 

the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie if such an entity is a vie then the company performs an analysis to determine who is the primary beneficiary if the company is the primary beneficiary then the entity is consolidated the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 

the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the propertys expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties further the company evaluates whether its coinvestments have other than temporary impairment and if so records an additional write down 

the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs including interest and real estate taxes incurred during development and redevelopment activities interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period included in capitalized costs are managements accounting estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with the companys development and redevelopment activities indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development accounting legal fees and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under development 

  

the company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions

funds from operations ffo 

ffo is a financial measure that is commonly used in the reit industry the company presents funds from operations as a supplemental operating performance measure ffo is not used by the company nor should it be considered to be as an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of the companys operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of the companys ability to fund its cash needs 

ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor does the company intend it to present a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance the company believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings further the company believes that its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 

in calculating ffo the company follows the definition for this measure published by the national association of reits nareit which is a reit trade association the company believes that under the nareit ffo definition the two most significant adjustments made to net income are i the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and ii the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of previously depreciated properties essex agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

management has consistently applied the nareit definition of ffo to all periods presented however other reits in calculating ffo may vary from the nareit definition for this measure and thus their disclosure of ffo may not be comparable to the companys calculation 

  

the following table sets forth the companys calculation of ffo for 2010 and 2009

interest rate sensitive liabilities 

the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and longterm debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the companys real estate investment portfolio and operations the companys interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 

the companys interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows management has estimated that the fair value of the companys 156 billion and 136 billion of fixed rate debt at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively to be 158 billion and 136 billion management has estimated the fair value of the companys 6952 million and 4906 million of variable rate debt at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively is 6728 million and 4587 million based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable and variable rate demand notes compared to those available in the marketplace 

 

 

 

 

 

  

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2010 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result the companys ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations and hedging strategies would depend on the exposures that arise during the period

as part of our strategic plan to own quality real estate in supplyconstrained markets the company continually evaluates all the communities and sell those which no longer meet our strategic criteria the company may use the capital generated from the dispositions to invest in higherreturn communities or other real estate investments repurchase the company’s common stock or repay debts the company believes that the sale of these communities will not have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows nor will their sale materially affect our ongoing operations generally the company seeks to have any impact of earnings dilution resulting from these dispositions offset by the positive impact of its acquisitions development and redevelopment activities 

in 2009 in accordance with our strategic plan the company sold five apartment communities for gross proceeds of 380 million for an aggregate gain of 86 million 

the 2010 disposition plan targets the sale of up to 100 million of real estate

essex apartment value fund ii 

essex apartment value fund ii lp “fund ii” is an investment fund formed by the company to add value through rental growth and asset appreciation utilizing the companys development redevelopment and asset management capabilities 

fund ii has eight institutional investors and the company with combined partner equity commitments of 2659 million which were fully contributed as of december 2008 the company contributed 750 million to fund ii which represents a 282 interest as general partner and limited partner and the company uses the equity method of accounting for its investment in fund ii fund ii utilized leverage equal to approximately 55 upon the initial acquisition of the underlying real estate fund ii invested in apartment communities in the company’s targeted west coast markets and as of december 31 2009 owned fourteen apartment communities the company records revenue for its asset management property management development and redevelopment services when earned and promote income when realized if fund ii exceeds certain financial return benchmarks 

offices and employees 

the company is headquartered in palo alto california and has regional offices in woodland hills california irvine california san diego california and bellevue washington as of december 31 2009 the company had 938 employees 

insurance 

the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the communities insured risks for comprehensive liabilities covers claims in excess of 25000 per incident and property casualty insurance covers losses in excess of a 50 million deductible per incident there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as for example losses from terrorism and earthquakes for which the company does not have insurance substantially all of the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquakes 

the company believes it has a proactive approach to its potential earthquake losses the company utilizes thirdparty seismic consultants for its acquisitions and may perform seismic upgrades to those acquisitions that are determined to have a higher level of potential loss from an earthquake the company utilizes thirdparty loss models to help to determine its exposure the majority of the communities are lower density gardenstyle apartments which may be less susceptible to material earthquake damage the company will continue to monitor thirdparty earthquake insurance pricing and conditions and may consider obtaining thirdparty coverage if it deems it cost effective  

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the company’s communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the apartment communities are located the communities also compete for residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale if the demand for our communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing apartment communities on a more costeffective basis rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

the company faces competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities some competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the company this competition may result in increased costs of apartment communities the company acquires andor develops 

working capital 

the company believes that cash flows generated by its operations existing cash and marketable securities balances availability under existing lines of credit access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2010 the timing source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment which can affect our plans for acquisitions dispositions development and redevelopment activities 

environmental considerations 

see the discussion under the caption “ the company’s portfolio may have unknown environmental liabilities ” in item 1a risk factors for information concerning the potential effect of environmental regulations on our operations 

other matters 

certain policies of the company 

we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation under the investment company act of 1940 the company has in the past five years and may in the future i issue securities senior to its common stock ii fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and iii offer shares of common stock andor units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for property acquisitions the company from time to time acquires partnership interests in partnerships and joint ventures either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries of the company when such entities’ underlying assets are real estate 

we invest primarily in apartment communities that are located in predominantly coastal markets within southern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area the company currently intends to continue to invest in apartment communities in such regions however these practices may be reviewed and modified periodically by management 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business operating results cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

we depend on our key personnel our success depends on our ability to attract and retain executive officers senior officers and company managers there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of any of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on the company 

capital and credit market conditions may affect our access to sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could negatively affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition over the past two years   the company’s financing activities have been impacted by the instability and tightening in the credit markets which has led to an increase in spreads and pricing of secured debt unsecured debt and lines of credit the company’s strong balance sheet the debt capacity available on the unsecured line of credit with a bank group and the secured line of credit with freddie mac and access to fannie mae and freddie mac secured debt financing have provided some insulation to the company from the turmoil being experienced by many other real estate companies the company has benefited from borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac and there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future continued turmoil in the capital markets and further job losses could negatively impact the company’s ability to make acquisitions develop communities obtain new financing and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates 

debt financing has inherent risks at december 31 2009 we had approximately 185 billion of indebtedness including 4906 million of variable rate indebtedness of which 1971 million is subject to interest rate protection agreements we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the following 

 

 

 

 

the company is uncertain about its ability to refinance balloon payments as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 185 billion of mortgage loans exchangeable bonds and line of credit borrowings most of which are subject to balloon payments see notes 7 and 8 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for more details we do not expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations to make all of these balloon payments 

we may not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness bonds or lines of credit the communities subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the lender this could cause us to lose income and asset value we may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 

debt financing of communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service debt where possible we intend to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on our investments and to provide for additional investments that we could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the communities will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code we may obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all of the communities these mortgages may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized 

as of december 31 2009 the company had 77 of its 118 consolidated communities encumbered by debt of the 77 communities 61 are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those communities with respect to the remaining 16 communities there are 3 crosscollateralized mortgages secured by 11 communities 3 communities and 2 communities respectively the holders of this indebtedness will have rights with respect to these communities and to the extent indebtedness is crosscollateralized lenders may seek to foreclose upon communities which are not the primary collateral for their loan this may accelerate other indebtedness secured by communities foreclosure of communities would reduce our income and net asset value 

rising interest rates may affect our costs of capital and financing activities and results of operation interest rates could increase rapidly which could result in higher interest expense on our variable rate indebtedness prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with positive economic returns on investment and our ability to refinance existing borrowings 

interest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses periodically we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates and may continue to do so although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged we may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk our policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with arated financial institutions 

bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain communities at december 31 2009 we had approximately 2141 million of variable rate taxexempt financing relating to the following apartment communities inglenook court wandering creek boulevard huntington breakers camarillo oaks fountain park anchor village hidden valley and belmont station this taxexempt financing subjects these communities to certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants we expect to engage in taxexempt financings in the future the internal revenue code and rules and regulations thereunder impose various restrictions conditions and requirements excluding interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue code also requires that at least 20 of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed a specified percentage generally 50 of the median income for the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development department of the federal government in addition to federal requirements certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed communities if we are required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and we may be subject to additional contractual liability 

general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred if the communities do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected income from the communities may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

as leases at the communities expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to us income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws eg the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and tax laws real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited 

national and regional economic environments can negatively impact our operating results during the past two years a confluence of factors has resulted in job losses turmoil and volatility in the capital markets and caused a national and global recession the companys forecast for the national economy assumes the return of growth with estimated gross domestic product growth of the national economy and the economies of the western states in the event of a continued recession the company could incur continued reduction in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising and turnover expenses 

inflationdeflation may affect rental rates and operating expenses substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses 

acquisitions of communities may fail to meet expectations  the company intends to continue to acquire apartment communities however there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet our expectations the company’s estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow us to market an acquired apartment community as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate we expect to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by the company the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the company’s existing stockholders if we finance new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless we obtain substitute financing the company may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development or such lines of credit may be not available on advantageous terms 

development and redevelopment activities may be delayed not completed andor not achieve expected results  we pursue development and redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals which have no assurance of being received the company’s development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the company’s stockholders further the development and redevelopment of communities is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see the risk factor “ general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values ” 

the geographic concentration of the company’s communities and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact our financial condition and operating results  the company generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2009 from our communities concentrated in southern california los angeles orange santa barbara san diego and ventura counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area for the year ended december 31 2009 81 of the company’s rental revenues were generated from communities located in california this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations the economic condition of these markets could affect occupancy property revenues and expenses from the communities and their underlying asset values the financial results of major local employers also may impact the cash flow and value of certain of the communities this could have a negative impact on our financial condition and operating results which could affect our ability to pay expected dividends to our stockholders 

competition in the apartment community market may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for our communities there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the communities are located if the demand for our communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing apartment communities on a more costeffective basis rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations we also face competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities this competition may result in an increase in costs and prices of apartment communities that we acquire andor develop 

the price per share of the company’s stock may fluctuate significantly the market price per share of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of the factors listed above are beyond the company’s control these factors may cause the market price of shares of the company’s common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations or business prospects 

the company’s future issuances of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock  in order to finance our acquisition and development activities we have issued and sold common stock preferred stock and convertible debt securities for example during 2009 and 2008 the company issued and sold 2740450 and 1209050 shares of common stock for 1985 million and 1428 million net of fees and commissions respectively the company may in the future sell further shares of common stock including pursuant to its controlled equity offering program with cantor fitzgerald  co 

in 2007 the company filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec allowing the company to sell an undetermined number of equity and debt securities as defined in the prospectus future sales of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 

the company’s chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest our chairman george m marcus is not an employee of the company and is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest mr marcus owns interests in various other real estaterelated businesses and investments he is the chairman of the marcus  millichap company “tmmc” which is a holding company for certain real estate brokerage and services companies tmmc has an interest in pacific property company a company that invests in apartment communities 

mr marcus has agreed not to divulge any information that may be received by him in his capacity as chairman of the company to any of his affiliated companies and that he will abstain his vote on any and all resolutions by the company board of directors regarding any proposed acquisition andor development of an apartment community where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of his affiliated companies notwithstanding this agreement mr marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with us in acquiring andor developing apartment communities which competition may be detrimental to us in addition due to such potential competition for real estate investments mr marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with us which may be detrimental to the interests of the company’s stockholders 

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock  as of december 31 2009 george m marcus the chairman of our board of directors wholly or partially owned 1774375 shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of all vested options this represents approximately 57 of the outstanding shares of our common stock mr marcus currently does not have majority control over us however he currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all our stockholders 

under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for any amendment of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with us our directors and executive officers including mr marcus have substantial influence on us consequently their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders 

the voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock   in general the holders of our outstanding shares of preferred stock do not have any voting rights however if full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock for six quarterly distributions periods the holders of preferred stock who have not received distributions voting together as a single class will have the right to elect two additional directors to serve on our board of directors 

these voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have been paid in full at that time the holders of the preferred stock are divested of these voting rights and the term and office of the directors so elected immediately terminates while any shares of our preferred stock are outstanding the company may not without the consent of the holders of twothirds of the outstanding shares of each series of preferred stock each voting separately as a single class 

 

 

 

these voting rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of our common stock 

the redemption rights of the series b preferred units and series f preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of the company’s common stock upon the occurrence of one of the following events the terms of the operating partnership’s series b preferred units require it to redeem all of such units and the terms of the company’s series f preferred stock provide the holders of the majority of the outstanding series f preferred stock the right to require the company to redeem all of such stock 

 

 

 

the aggregate redemption price of the series b preferred units would be 80 million and the aggregate redemption price of the series f preferred stock would be 25 million plus in each case any accumulated distributions 

these redemption rights may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of holders of common stock further these redemption rights might trigger situations where the company needs to conserve its cash reserves in which event such redemption might adversely affect the company and its common holders 

the maryland business combination law may not allow certain transactions between the company and its affiliates to proceed without compliance with such law  under maryland law “business combinations” between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these business combinations include a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities an interested stockholder is defined as any person and certain affiliates of such person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock the law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions this means that the transaction must be approved by at least 

 

 

the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under maryland law as permitted by the statute the board of directors of the company irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by the company george m marcus who is the chairman of the company and tmmc or any entity owned or controlled by mr marcus and tmmc consequently the fiveyear prohibition and supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to any business combination between the company mr marcus or tmmc as a result the company may in the future enter into business combinations with mr marcus and tmmc without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland general corporation law 

antitakeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement charter bylaws and certain provisions of maryland law could delay defer or prevent a change in control  while the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on the company’s ability to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of the company’s stockholders the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership the company cannot without first obtaining the consent of a majorityininterest of the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of our general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity such limitations on the company’s ability to act may result in our being precluded from taking action that the board of directors believes is in the best interests of the company’s stockholders as of december 31 2009 the limited partners held or controlled approximately 77 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership allowing such actions to be blocked by the limited partners 

the company’s charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other terms of such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock we may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control such a transaction might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock also such a class of preferred stock could have dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders of common stock 

the company’s charter contains other provisions that may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of the company’s stockholders the charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

the maryland general corporations law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed to be “control shares” under the maryland general corporations law “control shares” are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the company’s stockholders 

our charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors which in turn may delay defer or prevent a transaction including a change in control those provisions include 

 

 

 

 

 

the company’s joint ventures and joint ownership of communities and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the company’s ability to control such communities and partial interests  instead of purchasing apartment communities directly we have invested and may continue to invest in joint ventures joint venture partners often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or our policies or objectives consequently a joint venture partners’ actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although we seek to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives we may be unable to take action without our joint venture partners’ approval or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent should a joint venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities 

from time to time the company through the operating partnership invests in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing or managing real property in certain circumstances the operating partnership’s interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership’s objectives the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity we have and in the future may enter into transactions that could require us to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets into joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within our control occur although we plan to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on their sale pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the internal revenue code we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on our financial position 

there are risks that fund ii may operate in ways that may adversely impact the company’s interests the company is the general partner of fund ii and with fund ii there are the following risks 

 

 

 

investments in mortgages and other real estate securities could affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders  the company may invest in securities related to real estate which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders the company may purchase securities issued by entities which own real estate and invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations these mortgages may be first second or third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed in general investments in mortgages include the following risks 

 

 

 

 

if any of the above were to occur cash flows from operations and our ability to make expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected 

compliance with laws benefiting disabled persons may require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures or impact our investment strategy a number of federal state and local laws including the americans with disabilities act and regulations exist that may require modifications to existing buildings or restrict certain renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons and may require other structural features which add to the cost of buildings under construction legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial 

the company’s portfolio may have unknown environmental liabilities under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on in to or migrating from such property such laws often impose liability without regard as to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons exposed to such substances either through soil vapor or ingestion of the substances may claim personal injury damages persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility to which such substances or wastes were sent whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials “acms” into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of apartment communities for personal injury associated with acms in connection with the ownership direct or indirect operation management and development of apartment communities the company could be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and costs related to injuries of persons and property 

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property we carry certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk we have conducted environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater contamination at certain communities such contamination at certain of these apartment communities was reported to have migrated onsite from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations the former industrial users of the communities were identified as the source of contamination the environmental studies noted that certain communities are located adjacent to possible down gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination the lateral limits of which may extend onto such apartment communities the environmental studies also noted that at certain of these apartment communities contamination existed because of the presence of underground fuel storage tanks which have been removed in general in connection with the ownership operation financing management and development of apartment communities we may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities the company may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to persons and property 

there has been a number of lawsuits in recent years against owners and managers of apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements the company has been sued for mold related matters and has settled some but not all of such matters insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates the company has however purchased pollution liability insurance which includes some coverage for mold the company has adopted policies for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold when it is detected and to minimize any impact mold might have on residents of the property the company believes its mold policies and proactive response to address any known existence reduces its risk of loss from these cases there can be no assurances that the company has identified and responded to all mold occurrences but the company promptly addresses all known reports of mold liabilities resulting from such mold related matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows as of december 31 2009 potential liabilities for mold and other environmental liabilities are not considered probable or the loss cannot be quantified or estimated 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as “proposition 65” requiring that “clear and reasonable” warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke although we have sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 65 

methane gas is a naturallyoccurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas particularly in the southern california coastal areas methane is a nontoxic gas but can be ignitable in confined spaces although naturallyoccurring methane gas is not regulated at the state or federal level however some local governments such as the county of los angeles have imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems in areas where methane gas is known to be located methane gas is also associated with certain industrial activities such as former municipal waste landfills radon is also a naturallyoccurring gas that is found below the surface the company cannot assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane or radon gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas 

the company has almost no indemnification agreements from third parties for potential environmental cleanup costs at its communities the company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions or violations with respect to communities formerly owned by the company no assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of the communities reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of an apartment community did not create any material environmental condition not known to the company or that a material environmental condition does not exist as to any one or more of the communities the company has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described above 

the company may incur general uninsured losses the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the communities there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as for example losses for terrorism or earthquake for which the company does not have insurance coverage substantially all of the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity in january 2007 the company canceled its then existing earthquake policy and established a wholly owned insurance subsidiary pacific western insurance llc “pwi” through pwi the company is selfinsured as it relates to earthquake related losses additionally since january 2008 pwi has provided property and casualty insurance coverage for the first 50 million of the company’s property level insurance claims per incident 

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material in the event of a substantial loss insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full replacement cost of the company’s lost investment or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the company’s ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed 

changes in real estate tax and other laws may adversely affect the company’s results of operations  generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on apartment communities or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated decrease in revenue or increase in expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

changes in the company’s financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a limit on debt financing to a maximum of a 50 debt to total market capitalization and to be consistent with the existing covenants required to maintain the company’s unsecured line of credit bank facility the company’s organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred if the company changed this policy the company could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and the obligations of the operating partnership and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations such increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the communities 

the company is subject to various tax risks  the company has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code the company’s qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company’s control although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enables it to qualify as a reit it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions any of which could have retroactive effect could adversely affect the company’s ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect our stockholders if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year the company would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at corporate rates and the company would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders in computing its taxable income the company may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which the company failed to qualify the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders and the company would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders even if the company continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property 

the company has established several taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” despite its qualification as a reit the company’s trss must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its trss do not adversely affect its reit qualification it cannot provide assurance that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore it may be subject to a 100 penalty tax or its trss may be denied deductions to the extent its dealings with its trss are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature no assurances can be given that the company’s dealings with its trss will be arm’s length in nature 

from time to time the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its properties under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that the company holds as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since the company acquires properties for investment purposes it does not believe that its occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by the company are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then the company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to it from the prohibited transaction and the company’s ability to retain future gains on real property sales may be jeopardized income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect our ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes therefore no assurances can be given that we will be able to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit 

the us federal tax rate on certain corporate dividends paid to individuals and other noncorporate taxpayers is at a reduced rate of 15 until december 31 2010 it is uncertain whether this reduced rate will be continued beyond the scheduled expiration date dividends paid by reits to individuals and other noncorporate stockholders are not eligible for the reduced 15 rate however this may cause investors to view reit investments to be less attractive than investments in nonreit corporations which in turn may adversely affect the value of stock in reits including our stock

 item 2 properties 

the company’s portfolio as of december 31 2009 including communities owned by fund ii was comprised of 133 apartment communities comprising 27248 apartment units of which 13087 units are located in southern california 8270 units are located in the san francisco bay area and 5891 units are located in the seattle metropolitan area the company’s apartment communities accounted for 959 of the company’s revenues for the year ended december 31 2009

the 133 apartment communities had an average sameproperties occupancy as defined in item 7 based on “financial occupancy” during the year ended december 31 2009 of approximately 970 with respect to stabilized apartment communities with sufficient operating history occupancy figures are based on financial occupancy the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue actual rental revenue represents contractual revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of financial occupancy 

with respect to apartment communities which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient operating history occupancy figures are based on “physical occupancy” which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied units by rentable units for the year ended december 31 2009 none of the company’s apartment communities had book values equal to 10 or more of total assets of the company or gross revenues equal to 10 or more of aggregate gross revenues of the company

as of december 31 2009 we had ownership interests in 133 apartment communities comprising 27248 apartment units our apartment communities are located in the following major west coast regions 

southern california los angeles orange riverside santa barbara san diego and ventura counties

by region the companys operating results for 2008 and 2009 projected new housing supply job growth and market rent analysis are as follows 

southern california region  as of december 31 2009 this region represented 51 of the company’s consolidated apartment units during the year ended december 31 2009 sameproperty as defined below revenues decreased 29 in 2009 as compared to 2008 the company expects in 2010 new residential supply of 3300 multifamily and 5050 single family homes and which represents a total new supply of 02 of existing stock the company assumes a return to growth in this region with an increase of 28500 jobs or 04 growth and to experience an increase in market rents of 11 in 2010 

northern california region  as of december 31 2009 this region represented 28 of the company’s consolidated apartment units sameproperty revenues decreased 19 in 2009 as compared to 2008 the company expects in 2010 new residential supply of 1600 multifamily and 3500 single family homes which represents a total new supply of 02 of existing stock the company assumes a slight return to growth in this region with an increase of 10000 jobs and to experience an increase in market rents of 02 in 2010

despite the company’s 2010 forecast for market rents to be flat for its portfolio the company expects 2010 sameproperty revenues to decline approximately 55 compared to 2009 results as existing leases lower to market rents during 2010

the regional breakdown of the company’s 20092008 sameproperty portfolio for financial occupancy for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 is as follows 

 

the following table provides a breakdown of revenue amounts including the revenues attributable to 20092008 sameproperties

20092008 sameproperty revenues decreased by 99 million or 28 to 3456 million for 2009 compared to 3555 million in 2008 the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in scheduled rents of 139 million or a decrease of 39 average monthly rental rates for the 20092008 sameproperty communities were 1349 per unit for 2009 compared to 1368 per unit for 2008 scheduled rents decreased in all regions including a decrease in scheduled rents of 43 25 and 55 in southern california northern california and seattle metro respectively the decrease in scheduled rents was partially offset by an increase of occupancy of 70 basis points or 32 million from 963 for 2008 to 970 for 2009 ratio utility billing system “rubs” income increased 13 million and other income rent concessions and bad debt expense were consistent between years the company forecasts that although market rents are expected to be flat during 2010 sameproperty revenues will continue to decrease in 2010 by 55 due to an anticipated decrease in scheduled rents compared to 2009 

20092008 nonsame property revenues increased by 137 million or 288 to 615 million for 2009 from 477 million for 2008 the increase was primarily due to three new communities acquired since january 1 2008 two development communities in leaseup and eight communities that are in redevelopment and classified in nonsame property results 

management and other fees from affiliates decreased 08 million to 43 million in 2009 compared to 52 million in 2008 property management fees earned from fund ii increased by 03 million in 2009 compared to 2008 and the increase was offset by a decrease of 11 million in development and redevelopment fees earned from fund ii during 2009 compared to 2008 

property operating expenses excluding real estate taxes increased 36 million or 37 for 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the acquisition of three new properties and the completion of two development properties 20092008 sameproperty operating expenses excluding real estate taxes increased slightly by 04 million or 05 for 2009 compared to 2008 

real estate taxes increased 37 million or 111 for 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the acquisition of three new communities the completion of two development properties and increases in real estate taxes in the seattle metro area of 06 million or 131 for the seattle metro 20092008 sameproperty region compared to 2008 also there were increases in assessments for the company’s california communities that are limited to 2 per year total 20092008 sameproperty real estate taxes increased 11 million or 39 compared to 2008 

depreciation expense increased by 83 million or 76 for 2009 compared to 2008 due to the acquisition of three new communities and the completion of two development properties depreciation expense also increased due to the capitalization of approximately 556 million in additions to rental properties during 2009 including 267 million spent on redevelopment and revenue generating capital expenditures along with a full year of depreciation expense in 2009 versus a partial year of depreciation expense in 2008 for 2008 improvements capitalized 

general and administrative expense decreased 33 million or 122 for 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a workforce reduction of corporate employees in the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 along with other cost control measures implemented by the company 

impairment and other charges were 174 million for 2009 due to the writeoff of development costs totaling 67 million related to two land parcels that will no longer be developed by the company 38 million of noncash expense related to cancellation of the outperformance plan and the writeoff of 58 million investment in a predevelopment joint venture 06 million recorded for additional loan loss reserves related a note receivable secured by an apartment community in the portland metropolitan area and 06 million for severance charges related to a workforce reduction during 2008 the company recorded impairment and other charges of 14 million consisting of 07 million for loan loss reserves for a note receivable and 07 million for severance charges related to a workforce reduction

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities the company defines critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require the companys management to exercise their most difficult subjective and complex judgments the company’s critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas i consolidation under applicable accounting standards of various entities ii assessing the carrying values of the companys real estate and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates and iii internal cost capitalization the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 

the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie if such an entity is a vie then the company performs an analysis to determine who is the primary beneficiary if the company is the primary beneficiary then the entity is consolidated the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 

the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties further the company evaluates whether its coinvestments have other than temporary impairment and if so records an additional write down 

the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs including interest and real estate taxes incurred during development and redevelopment activities interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period included in capitalized costs are management’s accounting estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with the companys development and redevelopment activities indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development accounting legal fees and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under development 

the company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 

forward looking statements 

certain statements in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k which are not historical facts may be considered forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended including statements regarding the companys expectations hopes intentions beliefs and strategies regarding the future forward looking statements include statements regarding the companys expectations as to the timing of completion of current development and redevelopment projects and the stabilization dates of such projects its 2010 acquisition plan and its 2010 disposition plan expectation as to the total projected costs of development and redevelopment projects beliefs as to the adequacy of future cash flows to meet operating requirements and anticipated cash needs and to provide for dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements expectations as to the amount of capital expenditures expectations as to the amount of nonrevenue generating capital expenditures future acquisitions the companys and development and redevelopment pipeline the anticipated performance of existing properties anticipated property and growth trends in various geographic regions statements regarding the companys financing activities and the use of proceeds from such activities 

such forwardlooking statements involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors including but not limited to that the company will fail to achieve its business objectives that the actual completion of development and redevelopment projects will be subject to delays that the stabilization dates of such projects will be delayed that the total projected costs of current development and redevelopment projects will exceed expectations that such development and redevelopment projects will not be completed that development and redevelopment projects and acquisitions will fail to meet expectations that estimates of future income from an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate that future cash flows will be inadequate to meet operating requirements andor will be insufficient to provide for dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements that the actual nonrevenue generating capital expenditures will exceed the companys current expectations that there may be a downturn in the markets in which the companys communities are located that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness as well as those risks special considerations and other factors discussed under the caption “potential factors affecting future operating   results” below and those discussed in item 1a risk factors of this form 10k and those risk factors and special considerations set forth in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the sec which may cause the actual results performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements all forwardlooking statements are made as of today and the company assumes no obligation to update this information 

potential factors affecting future operating results 

many factors affect the company’s actual financial performance and may cause the company’s future results to be different from past performance or trends these factors include those set forth under the caption “risk factors” in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

funds from operations ffo 

ffo is a financial measure that is commonly used in the reit industry the company presents funds from operations as a supplemental performance measure ffo is not used by the company nor should it be considered to be as an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of the company’s operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of the companys ability to fund its cash needs 

ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor does the company intend it to present a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance the company believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings further the company believes that its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 

in calculating ffo the company follows the definition for this measure published by the national association of reits “nareit” which is a reit trade association the company believes that under the nareit ffo definition the two most significant adjustments made to net income are i the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and ii the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of previously depreciated properties essex agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

 

management has consistently applied the nareit definition of ffo to all periods presented however other reits in calculating ffo may vary from the nareit definition for this measure and thus their disclosure of ffo may not be comparable to essex’s calculation 

the following table sets forth the company’s calculation of ffo for 2009 and 2008 

 

  

1 amount includes the following i minority interest related to operating partnership units and ii add back of depreciation expense from unconsolidated coinvestments and less depreciation attributable to thirdparty ownership of consolidated coinvestments 

2 assumes conversion of all dilutive outstanding operating partnership interests in the operating partnership 

the following table sets forth the company’s cash flows for 2009 and 2008  in thousands 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

interest rate hedging activities 

the company’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks to accomplish this objective the company uses interest rate forwardstarting swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy as of december 31 2009 we have entered into seven forwardstarting swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in the interestrelated cash outflows on forecasted issuance of longterm debt the forwardstarting swaps are cash flow hedges of the variability of forecasted interest payments associated with expected financings between 2010 and 2011 as of december 31 2009 the company also had 4906 million of variable rate indebtedness of which 1971 million is subject to interest rate cap protection all of our derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and the company does not have any fair value hedges as of december 31 2009 the following table summarizes the notional amount carrying value and estimated fair value of our derivative instruments used to hedge interest rates as of december 31 2009 the notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a particular security that is currently hedged at one time but does not represent exposure to credit interest rates or market risks the table also includes a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the impact on our derivative instruments from an increase or decrease in 10year treasury bill interest rates by 50 basis points as of december 31 2009 

 

 

interest rate sensitive liabilities 

the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and longterm debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company’s real estate investment portfolio and operations the company’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 

the company’s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows management believes that the carrying amounts of its unsecured bank line debt approximates fair value as of december 31 2008 because interest rates yields and other terms for these instruments are consistent with yields and other terms currently available to the company for similar instruments management has estimated that the fair value of the company’s 136 billion of fixed rate mortgage notes payable at december 31 2009 approximates its fair value and the company’s 4906 million of variable rate debt at december 31 2009 is 4587 million based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable and variable rate demand notes compared to those available in the marketplace 

 

1 150 million covered by three forwardstarting swaps with fixed rates ranging from 5099 to 5824 with a settlement date on or before january 1 2011 

2 125 million covered by forwardstarting swaps with fixed rates ranging from 5655 to 58795 with a settlement date on or before february 1 2011 50 million covered by a forwardstarting swap with a fixed rate of 5535 with a settlement date on or before july 1 2011 50 million covered by a forwardstarting swap with a fixed rate of 5343 with a settlement date on or before october 1 2011 the company intends to encumber certain unencumbered assets during 2011 in conjunction with the settlement of these forwardstarting swaps 

3 1971 million subject to interest rate caps 

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2009 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations and hedging strategies would depend on the exposures that arise during the period

business objectives and strategies 

 

the following is a discussion of our business objectives and strategies in regards to real estate investment and management one or more of these criteria may be amended or rescinded from time to time without stockholder vote 

 

business objectives 

the companys primary business objectives are to increase stockholders’ value by investing in and operating communities located in supply constrained markets and by improving operating results and the value of its communities while maintaining a strong balance sheet the company intends to achieve these objectives by 

 

 

 

the company cannot assure stockholders that the company will achieve its business objectives 

business strategies 

research driven approach – we believe that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio growth begin with extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge 

utilizing a proprietary research model that we have developed over the last two decades we continually assess markets where we currently operate as well as markets where we consider future investment opportunities by evaluating the following 

 

 

 

 

recognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical we regularly evaluate the results of our regional economic as well as our local market research and adjust the geographic focus of our portfolio accordingly we seek to increase our portfolio allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to decrease such allocations in markets projected to have declining economic conditions likewise the company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease such allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields 

property operations – we manage our communities by focusing on strategies that will generate aboveaverage rental growth tenant retentionsatisfaction and longterm asset appreciation we intend to achieve this by utilizing the strategies set forth below 

 

 

 

 

current business activities 

acquisitions 

acquisitions is an important component of our business plan and during 2008 we completed the acquisition of two communities totaling 884 million 

 

 

 

 

 

dispositions of real estate 

 

as part of our strategic plan to own quality real estate in supplyconstrained markets the company continually evaluates all the communities and sell those which no longer meet our strategic criteria the company may use the capital generated from the dispositions to invest in higherreturn communities repurchase the companys common stock or repay debts the company believes that the sale of these communities will not have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows nor will their sale materially affect our ongoing operations generally any impact of earnings dilution resulting from these dispositions will be offset by the positive impact of our acquisitions development and redevelopment activities 

in 2008 in accordance with our strategic plan the company sold three apartment communities for gross proceeds of 996 million two recreational vehicle “rv” parks and one manufactured housing community for gross proceeds of 189 million

fund ii  development pipeline 

 

the following table sets forth information regarding fund ii’s development pipeline 

 

 

 

1 includes incurred costs and estimated costs to complete these development projects 

2 all estimated remaining costs will be funded by construction loans 

offices and employees 

the company is headquartered in palo alto california and has regional offices in woodland hills california irvine california san diego california and bellevue washington as of december 31 2008 the company had approximately 930 employees 

insurance 

the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the communities insured risks for comprehensive liabilities covers claims in excess of 25000 per incident and property casualty insurance covers losses in excess of a 50 million deductible per incident there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as for example losses from terrorism and earthquake for which the company does not have insurance substantially all of the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquakes 

the company believes it has a proactive approach to its potential earthquake losses the company utilizes thirdparty seismic consultants for its acquisitions and performs seismic upgrades to those acquisitions that are determined to have a higher level of potential loss from an earthquake the company utilizes internal and thirdparty loss models to help to determine its exposure the majority of the communities are lower density gardenstyle apartments which may be less susceptible to earthquake damage the company will continue to monitor thirdparty earthquake insurance pricing and conditions and may consider obtaining thirdparty coverage if it deems it cost effective  

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our apartment communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the apartment communities are located the communities also compete for residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale if the demand for our communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing apartment communities on a more costeffective basis rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we face competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do this competition may result in increased costs of apartment communities we acquire andor develop 

working capital 

we believe that cash flows generated by our operations existing cash balances availability under existing lines of credit access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2009 the timing source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment which can affect our plans for acquisitions dispositions development and redevelopment activities 

environmental considerations 

see the discussion under the caption “ the company’s portfolio may have unknown environmental liabilities ” in item 1a risk factors for information concerning the potential effect of environmental regulations on our operations 

other matters 

certain policies of the company 

we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation under the investment company act of 1940 the company has in the past five years and may in the future i issue securities senior to its common stock ii fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and iii offer shares of common stock andor units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for property acquisitions the company from time to time acquires partnership interests in partnerships and joint ventures either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries of the company when such entities’ underlying assets are real estate in general the company does not i underwrite securities of other issuers or ii actively trade in loans or other investments 

we invest primarily in apartment communities that are located in predominantly coastal markets within southern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area the company currently intends to continue to invest in apartment communities in such regions however these practices may be reviewed and modified periodically by management 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business operating results cash flows and financial conditions are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

 

we depend on our key personnel our success depends on our ability to attract and retain executive officers senior officers and company managers there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

 

capital and credit market conditions may affect our access to sources of capital andor the cost of capital which could negatively affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition the company’s current financing activities have been impacted by the instability and tightening in the credit markets which has led to an increase in spreads and pricing of secured and unsecured debt our strong balance sheet the established relationships with our unsecured line of credit bank group the secured line of credit with freddie mac and access to fannie mae and freddie mac secured debt financing have provided some insulation to us from the turmoil being experienced by many other real estate companies the company has benefited from borrowing from fannie mae and freddie mac and there are no assurances that these entities will lend to the company in the future the company has experienced more restrictive loan to value and debt service coverage ratio limits and an expansion in credit spreads continued turmoil in the capital markets could negatively impact the company’s ability to make acquisitions develop communities obtain new financing and refinance existing borrowing at competitive rates 

debt financing has inherent risks at december 31 2008 we had approximately 176 billion of indebtedness including 2511 million of variable rate mortgage indebtedness of which 1834 million is subject to interest rate protection agreements we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the company is uncertain about its ability to refinance balloon payments as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 176 billion of mortgage loans exchangeable bonds and line of credit borrowings most of which are subject to balloon payments see notes 7 and 8 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for more details we do not expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations to make all of these balloon payments these mortgages bonds and lines of credit borrowings have the following scheduled principal and balloon payments 

 

2009358 million 

20101524 million 

20111513 million 

2012318 million 

20133128 million 

thereafter108 billion 

 

we may not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness bonds or lines of credit the communities subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the lender this could cause us to lose income and asset value we may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 

 

debt financing of communities may result in insufficient cash flow to service debt where possible we intend to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on our investments and to provide for additional investments that we could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the communities will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code we may obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all of the communities these mortgages may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized 

 

as of december 31 2008 the company had 71 of its 122 consolidated communities encumbered by debt of the 71 communities 55 are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those communities with respect to the remaining 16 communities there are 4 crosscollateralized mortgages secured by 8 communities 3 communities 3 communities and 2 communities respectively the holders of this indebtedness will have rights with respect to these communities and to the extent indebtedness is crosscollateralized lenders may seek to foreclose upon communities which are not the primary collateral for their loan this may accelerate other indebtedness secured by communities foreclosure of communities would reduce our income and net asset value 

 

rising interest rates may affect our costs of capital and financing activities and results of operation interest rates could increase rapidly which could result in higher interest expense on our variable rate indebtedness prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop apartment communities with positive economic returns on investment and our ability to refinance existing borrowings 

 

as of december 31 2008 the company had approximately 2362 million of longterm variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at floating rates tied to the rate of shortterm taxexempt revenue bonds which mature at various dates from 2020 through 2034 149 million of shortterm variable rate indebtedness related to predevelopment projects due in 2010 and 1200 million of variable rate indebtedness under the secured line of credit due in december 2013 and bears interest at 99 to 150 basis points over the freddie mac reference rate and the interest rate is subject to change by the lender in december 2011 approximately 1834 million of the longterm variable rate indebtedness is subject to interest rate cap protection agreements which may reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates the remaining 528 million of longterm variable rate indebtedness and the 1200 borrowings under the secured line of credit were not subject to any interest rate cap protection agreements as of december 31 2008 an increase in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our net income and results of operations 

interest rate hedging arrangements may result in losses periodically we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates and may continue to do so although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged we may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk our policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with arated financial institutions 

 

bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain communities at december 31 2008 we had approximately 2362 million of variable rate taxexempt financing relating to the following apartment communities inglenook court wandering creek boulevard huntington breakers camarillo oaks fountain park anchor village and hidden valley this taxexempt financing subjects these communities to certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants we expect to engage in taxexempt financings in the future the internal revenue code and rules and regulations there under impose various restrictions conditions and requirements excluding interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue code also requires that at least 20 of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed a specified percentage generally 50 of the median income for the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development department of the federal government in addition to federal requirements certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed communities if we are required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and we may be subject to additional contractual liability 

 

general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values real estate investments are subject to a variety of risks the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred if the communities do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected income from the communities may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as leases on the communities expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to us income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws eg the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and tax laws interest rate levels and the availability and terms of financing real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited 

 

national and regional economic environments can negatively impact our operating results during the past twelve to eighteen months a confluence of many factors has contributed to deteriorate economic conditions diminish expectations for the national and global economy and cause unprecedented turmoil and volatility in the capital markets the company’s 2009 forecast assumes continued slowing of the national economy with estimated gdp decline of 13 and nonfarm employment decrease of 2 million jobs the national economy and the economies of the western states in markets where we operate can impact our operating results some of these markets are concentrated in hightech sectors which have experienced economic downturns and currently the hightech sector is experiencing the impact of the deteriorating economic conditions as well as are most other sectors of the economy our property type and diverse geographic locations provide some degree of risk mitigation however we are not immune to prolonged economic downturns although we believe we are well positioned to meet these challenges it is possible a reduction in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising turnover and repair and maintenance expense could occur in the event of continued economic turmoil 

inflationdeflation may affect rental rates and operating expenses substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses 

 

acquisitions of communities may fail to meet expectations  we intend to continue to acquire apartment communities however there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet our expectations our estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow us to market an acquired apartment community as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate we expect to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by the company the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the company’s existing stockholders if we finance new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless we obtain substitute financing the company may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development or such lines of credit may be not available on advantageous terms 

 

development and redevelopment activities may be delayed not completed andor not achieve expected results  we pursue development and redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals which have no assurance of being received our development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the company’s stockholders further the development and redevelopment of communities is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see the risk factor “ general real estate investment risks may adversely affect property income and values ” 

 

the geographic concentration of the company’s communities and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact our financial condition and operating results  the company generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 from our communities concentrated in southern california los angeles orange santa barbara san diego and ventura counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area as of december 31 2008 82 of the company’s rental revenues were generated from communities located in california this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations the economic condition of these markets could affect occupancy market rental rates and expenses as well as impact the income generated from the communities and their underlying asset values the financial results of major local employers also may impact the cash flow and value of certain of the communities this could have a negative impact on our financial condition and operating results which could affect our ability to pay expected dividends to our stockholders 

 

competition in the apartment community market may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for our communities there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the communities are located the communities also compete for residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale if the demand for our communities is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing apartment communities on a more costeffective basis rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations we also face competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do this competition may result in an increase in costs and prices of apartment communities that we acquire andor develop 

dividend requirements as a result of preferred stock may lead to a possible inability to sustain dividends  we have series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock “series f preferred stock” with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately 25 million outstanding and series g cumulative convertible preferred stock “series g preferred stock” with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately 949 million outstanding as of february 2009 in addition we are required under limited conditions to issue series b cumulative redeemable preferred units “series b preferred units” with an aggregate liquidation preference of 80 million in exchange for outstanding preferred interests in the operating partnership the terms of the series b preferred units series f and g preferred stock provide for certain cumulative preferential cash distributions per each share of preferred units or stock 

 

these terms also provide that while such preferred stock is outstanding we cannot authorize declare or pay any distributions on our common stock unless all distributions accumulated on all shares of such preferred stock have been paid in full our failure to pay distributions on such preferred stock would impair our ability to pay dividends on our common stock our credit agreement limits our ability to pay dividends on our preferred stock if we fail to satisfy a fixed charge coverage ratio 

 

if the company wishes to issue any common stock in the future including upon the exercise of stock options the funds required to continue to pay cash dividends at current levels will be increased the company’s ability to pay dividends will depend largely upon the performance of our current communities and other apartment communities that may be acquired or developed in the future 

 

if the company cannot pay dividends on its common stock the company’s status as a real estate investment trust may be jeopardized our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is further limited by the maryland general corporation law under the maryland general corporation law the company may not make a distribution on stock if after giving effect to such distribution either 

 

 

 

 

the price per share of the company’s stock may fluctuate significantly the market price per share of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

many of the factors listed above are beyond our control these factors may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline regardless of our financial condition results of operations or business prospects 

 

sale of shares pursuant to our effective registration statement or that are issued upon conversion of our convertible preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the market price of the shares  the company has the following effective registration statements which allows for the sale into the public stock of common stock held by shareholders as specified in the registration statements 

 

 

 

during the third quarter of 2006 the company issued pursuant to a registration statement 5980000 shares of 4875 series g cumulative preferred stock for gross proceeds of 1495 million such shares are convertible subject to certain conditions into common stock which could be sold into the public market during 2009 the company has repurchased 546 million of the series g preferred stock and 949 million in aggregate liquidation value is currently outstanding 

 

the sale of the shares of common stock pursuant to these various registration statements or that are issued upon conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares 

  

the exchange and repurchase rights of exchangeable bonds and series g preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of common stock as of february 2009 the operating partnership has 1004 million principal amount of 3625 exchangeable bonds the “bonds” outstanding which mature on november 1 2025 the bonds are exchangeable into the companys common stock on or after november 1 2020 or prior to november 1 2020 under certain circumstances the bonds are redeemable at the companys option for cash at any time on or after november 4 2010 and are subject to repurchase for cash at the option of the holder on november 1 st in the years 2010 2015 and 2020 or upon the occurrence of certain events the bonds are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company 

 

in 2006 the company sold 5980000 shares of 4875 series g cumulative convertible preferred stock the “series g preferred stock” for gross proceeds of 1495 million of which 949 million in aggregate liquidation value is outstanding as of february 2009 holders may convert series g preferred stock into shares of the company’s common stock subject to certain conditions the conversion rate was initially 1830 shares of common stock per 25 share liquidation preference which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of 13662 per share of common stock the conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events on or after july 31 2011 the company may under certain circumstances cause some or all of the series g preferred stock to be converted into shares of common stock at the then prevailing conversion rate further if a fundamental change occurs as defined in the articles supplementary for the series g preferred stock then the holders may require the company to repurchase all or part of their series g preferred stock subject to certain conditions 

 

the exchange of the bonds andor series g preferred stock for common stock would dilute stockholder ownership in the company and such exchange could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities if the bonds and series g preferred stock are not exchanged the repurchase price of the bonds and series g preferred stock may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of the holders of common stock further these repurchase rights may be triggered in situations where the company needs to conserve its cash reserves in which event such repurchase might adversely affect the company and its common stockholders 

 

the company’s future issuances of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock  in order to finance our acquisition and development activities we have issued and sold common stock preferred stock and convertible debt securities for example during 2008 and 2007 the company issued and sold 1209050 and 1670500 shares of common stock for 1428 million and 2137 million net of fees and commissions respectively the company may in the future sell further shares of common stock including pursuant to its controlled equity offering program with cantor fitzgerald  co 

 

in november 2008 the holders of the outstanding 7875 series d cumulative redeemable preferred units of essex portfolio lp exchanged their preferred units with a par value of 500 million for 363000 shares of common stock of the company and 100 million in cash plus accrued dividends 

 

in 2007 the company filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec allowing the company to sell an undetermined number of equity and debt securities as defined in the prospectus future sales of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 

 

the company’s chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest our chairman george m marcus is not an employee of the company and is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest mr marcus owns interests in various other real estaterelated businesses and investments he is the chairman of the marcus  millichap company “tmmc” which is a holding company for certain real estate brokerage and services companies tmmc has an interest in pacific property company a company that invests in apartment communities 

mr marcus has agreed not to divulge any information that may be received by him in his capacity as chairman of the company to any of his affiliated companies and that he will abstain his vote on any and all resolutions by the company board of directors regarding any proposed acquisition andor development of an apartment community where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of his affiliated companies notwithstanding this agreement mr marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with us in acquiring andor developing apartment communities which competition may be detrimental to us in addition due to such potential competition for real estate investments mr marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with us which may be detrimental to the interests of the company’s stockholders 

 

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock  as of december 31 2008 george m marcus the chairman of our board of directors wholly or partially owned 1772199 shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of all vested options this represents approximately 67 of the outstanding shares of our common stock mr marcus currently does not have majority control over us however he currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all our stockholders 

 

under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for any amendment of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with us our directors and executive officers including mr marcus have substantial influence on us consequently their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders 

the voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock   in general the holders of our outstanding shares of preferred stock do not have any voting rights however if full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock for six quarterly distributions periods the holders of preferred stock who have not received distributions voting together as a single class will have the right to elect two additional directors to serve on our board of directors 

 

these voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have been paid in full at that time the holders of the preferred stock are divested of these voting rights and the term and office of the directors so elected immediately terminates while any shares of our preferred stock are outstanding the company may not without the consent of the holders of twothirds of the outstanding shares of each series of preferred stock each voting separately as a single class 

 

 

 

 

 

these voting rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of our common stock 

 

the redemption rights of the series b preferred units series f preferred stock and series g preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of the company’s common stock upon the occurrence of one of the following events the terms of the operating partnership’s series b preferred units require it to redeem all of such units and the terms of the company’s series f preferred stock and the series g preferred stock provide the holders of the majority of the outstanding series f preferred stock and series g preferred stock the right to require the company to redeem all of such stock 

 

 

 

 

 

the aggregate redemption price of the series b preferred units would be 80 million the aggregate redemption price of the series f preferred stock would be 25 million and the aggregate redemption price of the series g preferred stock would be 949 million plus in each case any accumulated distributions 

 

these redemption rights may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of holders of common stock further these redemption rights might trigger situations where the company needs to conserve its cash reserves in which event such redemption might adversely affect the company and its common holders 

the maryland business combination law may not allow certain transactions between the company and its affiliates to proceed without compliance with such law  under maryland law “business combinations” between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these business combinations include a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities an interested stockholder is defined as any person and certain affiliates of such person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock the law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions this means that the transaction must be approved by at least 

 

 

 

the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under maryland law as permitted by the statute the board of directors of the company irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by us george m marcus william a millichap who are the chairman and a director of the company respectively and tmmc or any entity owned or controlled by messrs marcus and millichap and tmmc consequently the fiveyear prohibition and supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to any business combination between us and mr marcus mr millichap or tmmc as a result we may in the future enter into business combinations with messrs marcus and millichap and tmmc without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland general corporation law 

 

antitakeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement charter bylaws and certain provisions of maryland law could delay defer or prevent a change in control  while the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on the company’s ability to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of the company’s stockholders the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership the company cannot without first obtaining the consent of a majorityininterest of the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of our general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity such limitations on the company’s ability to act may result in our being precluded from taking action that the board of directors believes is in the best interests of the company’s stockholders as of december 31 2008 the limited partners held or controlled approximately 84 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership allowing such actions to be blocked by the limited partners 

 

the company’s charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other terms of such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock we may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control such a transaction might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock also such a class of preferred stock could have dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders of common stock 

the company’s charter contains other provisions that may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of the company’s stockholders the charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

the maryland general corporations law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed to be “control shares” under the maryland general corporations law “control shares” are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the company’s stockholders 

our charter and bylaws also contain other provisions that may impede various actions by stockholders without approval of our board of directors which in turn may delay defer or prevent a transaction including a change in control those provisions include 

 

 

 

 

 

the company’s joint ventures and joint ownership of communities and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the company’s ability to control such communities and partial interests  instead of purchasing apartment communities directly we have invested and may continue to invest in joint ventures joint venture partners often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or our policies or objectives consequently a joint venture partners’ actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although we seek to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives we may be unable to take action without our joint venture partners’ approval or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent should a joint venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities 

 

from time to time we through the operating partnership invest in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing or managing real property in certain circumstances the operating partnership’s interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership’s objectives the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity we have and in the future may enter into transactions that could require us to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets into joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within our control occur although we plan to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on their sale pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the internal revenue code we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on our financial position 

there are risks that fund ii may operate in ways that may adversely impact the company’s interests the company is the general partner of fund ii and with fund ii there are the following risks 

 

 

 

 

 

we will however seek to maintain sufficient influence over fund ii to permit it to achieve its business objectives 

 

investments in mortgages and other real estate securities could affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders  the company may invest in securities related to real estate which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders the company may purchase securities issued by entities which own real estate and invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations these mortgages may be first second or third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed in general investments in mortgages include the following risks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of the above were to occur cash flows from operations and our ability to make expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected 

 

the company’s portfolio may have unknown environmental liabilities under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on in to or migrating from such property such laws often impose liability without regard as to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons exposed to such substances either through soil vapor or ingestion of the substances may claim personal injury damages persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility to which such substances or wastes were sent whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials “acms” into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of apartment communities for personal injury associated with acms in connection with the ownership direct or indirect operation management and development of apartment communities the company could be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and costs related to injuries of persons and property 

 

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property we carry certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk we have conducted environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater contamination at certain communities such contamination at certain of these apartment communities was reported to have migrated onsite from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations the former industrial users of the communities were identified as the source of contamination the environmental studies noted that certain communities are located adjacent to any possible down gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination the lateral limits of which may extend onto such apartment communities the environmental studies also noted that at certain of these apartment communities contamination existed because of the presence of underground fuel storage tanks which have been removed in general in connection with the ownership operation financing management and development of apartment communities we may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities we may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to persons and property 

recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements the company has been sued for mold related matters and has settled some but not all of such matters insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates the company has however purchased pollution liability insurance which includes some coverage for mold the company has adopted policies for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold when it is detected and to minimize any impact mold might have on residents of the property the company believes its mold policies and proactive response to address any known existence reduces its risk of loss from these cases there can be no assurances that the company has identified and responded to all mold occurrences but the company promptly addresses all known reports of mold liabilities resulting from such mold related matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows as of december 31 2008 potential liabilities for mold and other environmental liabilities are not considered probable or the loss cannot be quantified or estimated 

 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as “proposition 65” requiring that “clear and reasonable” warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke although we have sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 65 

 

methane gas is a naturallyoccurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas particularly in the southern california coastal areas methane is a nontoxic gas but can be ignitable in confined spaces although naturallyoccurring methane gas is not regulated at the state or federal level however some local governments such as the county of los angeles have imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems in areas where methane gas is known to be located methane gas is also associated with certain industrial activities such as former municipal waste landfills radon is also a naturallyoccurring gas that is found below the surface the company cannot assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane or radon gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas 

 

the company has almost no indemnification agreements from third parties for potential environmental cleanup costs at its communities the company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions or violations with respect to communities formerly owned by the company no assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of the communities reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of an apartment community did not create any material environmental condition not known to the company or that a material environmental condition does not exist as to any one or more of the communities the company has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described above 

 

the company may incur general uninsured losses the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the communities there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as for example losses for terrorism or earthquake for which the company does not have insurance coverage substantially all of the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity in january 2007 the company canceled its then existing earthquake policy and established a wholly owned insurance subsidiary pacific western insurance llc “pwi” through pwi the company is selfinsured as it relates to earthquake related losses additionally since january 2008 pwi has provided property and casualty insurance coverage for the first 50 million of the company’s property level insurance claims per incident 

 

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material in the event of a substantial loss insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full current market value of replacement cost of the company’s lost investment or the insurance carrier may become insolvent and not be able to cover the full amount of the insured losses inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the company’s ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed 

 

changes in real estate tax and other laws may adversely affect the company’s results of operations  generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on apartment communities or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated decrease in revenue or increase in expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

changes in the company’s financing policy may lead to higher levels of indebtedness the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a limit on debt financing consistent with the existing covenants required to maintain the company’s unsecured line of credit bank facility the company’s organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred if the company changed this policy the company could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and the obligations of the operating partnership and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations such increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the communities 

 

the company is subject to various tax risks  the company has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code irc the company’s qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex irc provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company’s control although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enable it to qualify as a reit the company cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions any of which could have retroactive effect could adversely impact the company’s ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect its stockholders if it fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year the company would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders in computing its taxable income the company may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it failed to qualify the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders and it would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders even if the company continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on its income and property 

 

the company has established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite the company’s qualification as a reit its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealing with its taxable reit subsidiaries does not adversely affect its reit qualification the company cannot provide assurance that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore the company may be subject to a 100 penalty tax or its taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent its dealings with its taxable reit subsidiaries’ are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature no assurances can be given that the company’s dealings with its taxable reit subsidiaries will be considered arm’s length in nature from time to time the company may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of its communities under the irc any gain resulting from transfers of communities that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire apartment communities for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of apartment communities by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then the company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to the company from the prohibited transaction and the company’s ability to retain future gains on real property sales may be jeopardized income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect the company’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes therefore no assurances can be given that the company will be able to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit

 item 2 properties 

our core apartment portfolio as of december 31 2008 including partial ownership interests was comprised of 134 apartment communities comprising 26992 apartment units of which 12980 units are located in southern california 8032 units are located in the san francisco bay area and 5980 units are located in the seattle metropolitan area the company’s apartment communities accounted for 948 of the company’s revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 

occupancy rates 

the 134 apartment communities had an average sameproperties occupancy as defined in item 7 based on “financial occupancy” during the year ended december 31 2008 of approximately 963 with respect to stabilized apartment communities with sufficient operating history occupancy figures are based on financial occupancy the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue actual rental revenue represents contractual revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of financial occupancy 

as of december 31 2008 the headquarters building was 100 occupied by the company and the southern california office building was 100 occupied based on physical occupancy with respect to office buildings occupancy figures are based on “physical occupancy” which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied square footage by rentable square footage with respect to apartment communities which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient operating history occupancy figures are based on “physical occupancy” which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied units by rentable units for the year ended december 31 2008 none of the company’s properties had book values equal to 10 or more of total assets of the company or gross revenues equal to 10 or more of aggregate gross revenues of the company

the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie if such an entity is a vie then the company analyzes the expected losses and expected residual returns to determine who is the primary beneficiary if the company is the primary beneficiary then the entity is consolidated the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 

 

the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties an impairment charge or investment valuation charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value 

 

the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs including interest and real estate taxes incurred during development and redevelopment activities interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period included in capitalized costs are management’s accounting estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with the companys development and redevelopment activities indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development accounting legal fees and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under development 

 

the company bases its accounting estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 

 

forward looking statements 

 

certain statements in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k which are not historical facts may be considered forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended including statements regarding the companys expectations hopes intentions beliefs and strategies regarding the future forward looking statements include statements regarding the companys expectations as to the timing of completion of current development and redevelopment projects and the stabilization dates of such projects expectation as to the total projected costs and rental rates of development and redevelopment projects beliefs as to the adequacy of future cash flows to meet operating requirements and to provide for dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements expectations as to the amount of capital expenditures expectations as to the amount of nonrevenue generating capital expenditures future acquisitions the companys and fund ii’s development and redevelopment pipeline the anticipated performance of existing properties anticipated results from various geographic regions statements regarding the companys financing activities and the use of proceeds from such activities 

such forwardlooking statements involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors including but not limited to that the company will fail to achieve its business objectives that the actual completion of development and redevelopment projects will be subject to delays that the stabilization dates of such projects will be delayed that the total projected costs of current development and redevelopment projects will exceed expectations that such development and redevelopment projects will not be completed that development and redevelopment projects and acquisitions will fail to meet expectations that estimates of future income from an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate that future cash flows will be inadequate to meet operating requirements andor will be insufficient to provide for dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements that the actual nonrevenue generating capital expenditures will exceed the companys current expectations that there may be a downturn in the markets in which the companys communities are located that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness as well as those risks special considerations and other factors discussed under the caption “potential factors affecting future operating   results” below and those discussed in item 1a risk factors of this form 10k and those risk factors and special considerations set forth in the company’s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the sec which may cause the actual results performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements all forwardlooking statements are made as of today and the company assumes no obligation to update this information 

 

potential factors affecting future operating results 

 

many factors affect the company’s actual financial performance and may cause the company’s future results to be different from past performance or trends these factors include those set forth under the caption “risk factors” in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k and the following 

 

funds from operations ffo 

 

ffo is a financial measure that is commonly used in the reit industry the company presents funds from operations as a supplemental performance measure ffo is not used by the company nor should it be considered to be as an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of the company’s operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of the companys ability to fund its cash needs 

 

ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor does the company intend it to present a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance the company believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings further the company believes that its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 

 

in calculating ffo the company follows the definition for this measure published by the national association of reits “nareit” which is a reit trade association the company believes that under the nareit ffo definition the two most significant adjustments made to net income are i the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and ii the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of previously depreciated properties essex agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

 

 

 

management has consistently applied the nareit definition of ffo to all periods presented however other reits in calculating ffo may vary from the nareit definition for this measure and thus their disclosure of ffo may not be comparable to essex’s calculation 

 

the following table sets forth the company’s calculation of ffo for 2008 and 2007 

 

 

1 amount includes the following i minority interest related to operating partnership units and ii add back of depreciation expense from unconsolidated coinvestments and less depreciation attributable to thirdparty ownership of consolidated coinvestments 

2 assumes conversion of all dilutive outstanding operating partnership interests in the operating partnership 

the following table sets forth the company’s cash flows for 2008 and 2007  in thousands 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

 

interest rate hedging activities 

 

the company’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks to accomplish this objective the company uses interest rate forwardstarting swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy as of december 31 2008 we have entered into seven forwardstarting swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in the interestrelated cash outflows on forecasted issuance of longterm debt the forwardstarting swaps are cash flow hedges of the variability of forecasted interest payments associated with expected financings between 2010 and 2011 as of december 31 2008 the company also had 2511 million of variable rate indebtedness of which 1834 million is subject to interest rate cap protection all of our derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and the company does not have any fair value hedges as of december 31 2008 the following table summarizes the notional amount carrying value and estimated fair value of our derivative instruments used to hedge interest rates as of december 31 2008 the notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a particular security that is currently hedged at one time but does not represent exposure to credit interest rates or market risks the table also includes a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the impact on our derivative instruments from an increase or decrease in 10year treasury bill interest rates by 50 basis points as of december 31 2008 

 

interest rate sensitive liabilities 

 

the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and longterm debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company’s real estate investment portfolio and operations the company’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 

 

the company’s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows management believes that the carrying amounts of its libor debt approximates fair value as of december 31 2008 because interest rates yields and other terms for these instruments are consistent with yields and other terms currently available to the company for similar instruments management has estimated that the fair value of the company’s 139 billion of fixed rate mortgage notes payable and exchangeable bonds at december 31 2008 is approximately 139 billion based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable compared to those available in the marketplace 

 

1 150 million covered by three forwardstarting swaps with fixed rates ranging from 5099 to 5824 with a settlement date on or before january 1 2011 

2 125 million covered by forwardstarting swaps with fixed rates ranging from 5655 to 58795 with a settlement date on or before february 1 2011 50 million covered by a forwardstarting swap with a fixed rate of 5535 with a settlement date on or before july 1 2011 50 million covered by a forwardstarting swap with a fixed rate of 5343 with a settlement date on or before october 1 2011 the company intends to encumber certain unencumbered assets during 2011 in conjunction with the settlement of these forwardstarting swaps 

 

3 1834 million subject to interest rate caps 

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2008 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations and hedging strategies would depend on the exposures that arise during the period

recognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical we regularly evaluate the results of our regional economic as well as our local market research and adjust the geographic focus of our portfolio accordingly we seek to increase our portfolio allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to decrease such allocations in markets projected to have declining economic conditions likewise the company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease such allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields

offices and employees 

 

the company is headquartered in palo alto california and has regional offices in woodland hills california irvine california san diego california and bellevue washington as of december 31 2007 the company had approximately 917 employees 

 

insurance 

 

the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the properties with a 50 million deductible per incident there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as for example losses from terrorism or earthquake for which the company does not have insurance coverage 

 

substantially all of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity the company believes it has a proactive approach to its potential earthquake losses the company utilizes thirdparty seismic consultants for its acquisitions and performs seismic upgrades to those acquisitions that are determined to have a higher level of potential loss from an earthquake the company utilizes internal and thirdparty loss models to help to determine its exposure the majority of the company’s properties are lower density gardenstyle apartments which may be less susceptible to earthquake damage the company will continue to monitor thirdparty earthquake insurance pricing and conditions and may consider obtaining thirdparty coverage if it deems it cost effective 

 

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its properties employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material 

 

competition 

 

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our apartment communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the properties are located the properties also compete for residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale if the demand for our properties is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing properties on a more costeffective basis rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we face competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of properties some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do this competition may result in increased costs of properties we acquire andor develop 

 

working capital 

 

we believe that cash flows generated by our operations existing cash balances availability under existing lines of credit access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash gains from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2008 the timing source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment which can affect our plans for acquisitions dispositions development and redevelopment activities 

 

environmental considerations 

 

see the discussion under the caption “possible environmental liabilities” in item 1a risk factors for information concerning the potential effect of environmental regulations on our operations 

 

other matters 

 

certain policies of the company 

 

we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation under the investment company act of 1940 the company has in the past five years and may in the future i issue securities senior to its common stock ii fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and iii offer shares of common stock andor units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for property acquisitions the company from time to time acquires partnership interests in partnerships and joint ventures either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries of the company when such entities’ 

underlying assets are real estate in general the company does not i underwrite securities of other issuers or ii actively trade in loans or other investments 

 

we invest primarily in apartment communities that are located in predominantly coastal markets within southern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area the company currently intends to continue to invest in apartment communities in such regions however these practices may be reviewed and modified periodically by management 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business operating results cash flows and financial conditions are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

 

we depend on our key personnel  our success depends on our ability to attract and retain executive officers senior officers and company managers there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

 

debt financing – at december 31 2007 we had approximately 166 billion of indebtedness including 2331 million of variable rate indebtedness of which 1527 million is subject to interest rate protection agreements we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uncertainty of our ability to refinance balloon payments  as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 166 billion of mortgage debt exchangeable bonds and line of credit borrowings most of which are subject to balloon payments see notes 8 and 9 to the company’s consolidated financial statements for more details we do not expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations to make all of these balloon payments these mortgages bonds and lines of credit borrowings have the following scheduled principal and balloon payments 

 

20081252 million 

20091857 million 

20101548 million 

20111665 million 

2012322 million 

thereafter9933 million 

 

we may not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness bonds or lines of credit the properties subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the lender this could cause us to lose income and asset value we may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 

 

the company’s current financing activities have not been severely impacted by the tightening in the credit markets our strong balance sheet the established relationships with our unsecured line of credit bank group and access to fannie mae and freddie mac secured debt financing have insulated us from the turmoil being experienced by many other real estate companies recently we have experienced some expansion in credit spreads as fannie mae and freddie mac’s tier 4 financing are currently at approximately 200 basis points over the relevant us treasury securities 

 

debt financing on properties may result in insufficient cash flow  where possible we intend to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on our investments and to provide for additional investments that we could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the properties will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code we may obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all of the properties these mortgages may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized 

 

as of december 31 2007 the company had 74 of its 123 consolidated apartment communities encumbered by debt of the 74 communities 51 are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those properties with respect to the 

remaining 23 communities there are 5 crosscollateralized mortgages secured by 8 communities 7 communities 3 communities 3 communities and 2 communities respectively the holders of this indebtedness will have claims against these communities and to the extent indebtedness is crosscollateralized lenders may seek to foreclose upon communities which are not the primary collateral for their loan this may accelerate other indebtedness secured by communities foreclosure of communities would reduce our income and net asset value 

 

risk of rising interest rates  current interest rates could potentially increase rapidly which could result in higher interest expense on our variable rate indebtedness prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and our ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 

 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 2209 million of longterm variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at floating rates tied to the rate of shortterm taxexempt revenue bonds which mature at various dates from 2020 through 2034 122 million of shortterm variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at libor plus 125 related to a predevelopment project due in 2009 and 1698 million of variable rate indebtedness under our lines of credit of the 1698 million of variable rate indebtedness under our lines of credit 1000 million is bearing interest at the freddie mac reference rate plus from 055 to 059 610 million is bearing interest at the underlying interest rate based on a tiered rate structure tied to the company’s corporate ratings and is currently at libor plus 080 and 88 million is bearing interest at the underlying interest rate based on the bank’s prime rate less 20 approximately 1527 million of the longterm indebtedness is subject to interest rate cap protection agreements which may reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates the remaining 682 million of longterm variable rate indebtedness was not subject to any interest rate cap protection agreements as of december 31 2007 an increase in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our net income and results of operations 

 

risk of losses on interest rate hedging arrangements – periodically we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates and may continue to do so although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged we may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk our policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with arated financial institutions 

 

bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain properties  at december 31 2007 we had approximately 2209 million of variable rate taxexempt financing relating to the following apartment communities inglenook court wandering creek boulevard treetops huntington breakers camarillo oaks fountain park anchor village and hidden valley parker ranch this taxexempt financing subjects these properties to certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants we expect to engage in taxexempt financings in the future in addition the internal revenue code and rules and regulations thereunder impose various restrictions conditions and requirements excluding interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue code also requires that at least 20 of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed a specified percentage generally 50 of the median income for the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development department of the federal government in addition to federal requirements certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed properties if we are required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and we may be subject to additional contractual liability 

 

adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate investment risks  real property investments are subject to a variety of risks the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred if the properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected 

 

income from the properties may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as leases on the properties expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to us income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws eg the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and tax laws interest rate levels and the availability and terms of financing real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited 

 

economic environment and impact on operating results  the national economy and the economies of the western states in markets where we operate can impact our operating results some of these markets are concentrated in hightech sectors which have experienced economic downturns and could again in the future our property type and diverse geographic locations provide some degree of risk mitigation however we are not immune to prolonged economic downturns although we believe we are well positioned to meet these challenges it is possible a reduction in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising turnover and repair and maintenance expense could occur in the event of economic uncertainty 

 

due to the companys concentration in supply restricted markets the company has not experienced any material adverse impact from increases in supply of unsold single family residences 

 

risk of inflationdeflation  substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses 

 

risks that acquisitions will fail to meet expectations  we intend to continue to acquire apartment communities however there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet our expectations our estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow us to market an acquired property as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate we expect to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by the company the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of the company’s existing stockholders if we finance new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless we obtain substitute financing the company may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development or such lines of credit may be not available on advantageous terms 

 

risks that development and redevelopment activities will be delayed not completed andor not achieve expected results  we pursue apartment community development and redevelopment projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals which have no assurance of being received our development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the company’s stockholders further the development of properties is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see “adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate investment risks” 

 

the geographic concentration of the company’s properties and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact our financial condition and operating results – the company generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 from properties concentrated in southern california los angeles orange santa barbara san diego and ventura counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the seattle metropolitan area as of december 31 2007 81 of the company’s property revenues were generated from properties located in california this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations the economic condition of these markets could affect occupancy market rental rates and expenses as well as impact the income generated from the properties and their underlying asset values 

the financial results of major local employers also may impact the cash flow and value of certain of the properties this could have a negative impact on our financial condition and operating results which could affect our ability to pay expected dividends to our stockholders 

 

competition in the apartment community market may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for our properties  there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our apartment communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the properties are located the properties also compete for residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale if the demand for our properties is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing properties on a more costeffective basis rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we also face competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of apartment communities some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do this competition may result in an increase in costs and prices of apartment communities that we acquire andor develop 

 

dividend requirements as a result of preferred stock may lead to a possible inability to sustain dividends  we have series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock “series f preferred stock” with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately 25 million outstanding and series g cumulative convertible preferred stock “series g preferred stock” with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately 1495 million outstanding in addition we are required under limited conditions to issue series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock “series b preferred stock” with an aggregate liquidation preference of 80 million and series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock “series d preferred stock” with an aggregate liquidation preference of 50 million in each case in exchange for outstanding preferred interests in the operating partnership the terms of the series b d f and g preferred stock provide for certain cumulative preferential cash distributions per each share of preferred stock 

 

these terms also provide that while such preferred stock is outstanding we cannot authorize declare or pay any distributions on our common stock unless all distributions accumulated on all shares of such preferred stock have been paid in full our failure to pay distributions on such preferred stock would impair our ability to pay dividends on our common stock our credit agreement limits our ability to pay dividends on our preferred stock if we fail to satisfy a fixed charge coverage ratio 

 

if the company wishes to issue any common stock in the future including upon the exercise of stock options the funds required to continue to pay cash dividends at current levels will be increased the company’s ability to pay dividends will depend largely upon the performance of our current properties and other properties that may be acquired or developed in the future 

 

if the company cannot pay dividends on its common stock the company’s status as a real estate investment trust may be jeopardized our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is further limited by the maryland general corporation law under the maryland general corporation law the company may not make a distribution on stock if after giving effect to such distribution either 

 

 

 

 

resale of shares pursuant to our effective registration statement or that are issued upon conversion of our convertible preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the market price of the shares – the company has the following effective registration statements which allows for the resale into the public stock of common stock held by stockholders as specified in the registration statements 

 

 

 

during the third quarter of 2006 we issued pursuant to a registration statement 5980000 shares of 4875 series g cumulative preferred stock for estimated gross proceeds of 1495 million such shares are convertible subject to certain conditions into common stock which could be resold into the public market 

 

the resale of the shares of common stock pursuant to these various registration statements or that are issued upon conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares 

 

the exchange and repurchase rights of exchangeable senior notes and series g preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of common stock  the operating partnership has 225 million principal amount of 3625 exchangeable senior notes the “notes” outstanding which mature on november 1 2025 the notes are exchangeable into the companys common stock on or after november 1 2020 or prior to november 1 2020 under certain circumstances the notes are redeemable at the companys option for cash at any time on or after november 4 2010 and are subject to repurchase for cash at the option of the holder on november 1 st in the years 2010 2015 and 2020 or upon the occurrence of certain events the notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company 

 

in 2006 the company sold 5980000 shares of 4875 series g cumulative convertible preferred stock the “series g preferred stock” for gross proceeds of 1495 million holders may convert series g preferred stock into shares of the company’s common stock subject to certain conditions the conversion rate will initially be 1830 shares of common stock per 25 share liquidation preference which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of 13662 per share of common stock the conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events on or after july 31 2011 the company may under certain circumstances cause some or all of the series g preferred stock to be converted into shares of common stock at the then prevailing conversion rate further if a fundamental change occurs as defined in the articles supplementary for the series g preferred stock then the holders may require the company to repurchase all or part of their series g preferred stock subject to certain conditions 

 

the exchange of the notes andor series g preferred stock for common stock would dilute stockholder ownership in the company and such exchange could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities if the notes and series g preferred stock are not exchanged the repurchase price of the notes and series g preferred stock may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of the holders of common stock further these repurchase rights may be triggered in situations where the company needs to conserve its cash reserves in which event such repurchase might adversely affect the company and its common stockholders 

 

our future issuances of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock  in order to finance our property acquisition and development activities we have issued and sold common stock preferred stock and convertible debt securities for example during 2007 the company sold 1500000 shares of its common stock in a public offering for proceeds of 1918 million net of underwriter fees and expenses during 2007 and 2006 pursuant to a controlled equity offering program that the company entered into with cantor fitzgerald  co the company issued and sold approximately 170500 and 427700 shares of common stock for 219 million and 483 million net of fees and commissions respectively the company may in the future sell further shares of common stock pursuant to a controlled equity offering program with cantor fitzgerald co 

 

in 2006 the company issued 5980000 shares of 4875 series g cumulative convertible preferred stock for gross proceeds of approximately 1495 million in 2005 the operating partnership sold 225 million principal amount of 3625 exchangeable senior notes which are exchangeable into the company’s common stock under certain conditions 

 

during the first quarter of 2007 the company filed a new shelf registration statement with the sec allowing the company to sell an undetermined number of equity and debt securities as defined in the prospectus future sales of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 

 

our chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest  our chairman george m marcus is not an employee of the company and is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest mr marcus owns interests in various other real estaterelated businesses and investments he is the chairman of the marcus  millichap company or “tmmc” which is a holding company for certain real estate brokerage and services companies tmmc has an interest in pacific 

property company a company that invests in apartment communities 

 

mr marcus has agreed not to divulge any information that may be received by him in his capacity as chairman of the company to any of his affiliated companies and that he will abstain his vote on any and all resolutions by the company board of directors regarding any proposed acquisition andor development of an apartment community where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of his affiliated companies notwithstanding this agreement mr marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with us in acquiring andor developing apartment communities which competition may be detrimental to us in addition due to such potential competition for real estate investments mr marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with us which may be detrimental to the interests of the company’s stockholders 

 

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock  as of december 31 2007 george m marcus the chairman of our board of directors wholly or partially owned 1768773 shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of all vested options this represents approximately 71 of the outstanding shares of our common stock mr marcus currently does not have majority control over us however he currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all our stockholders 

 

under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for any amendment of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with us our directors and executive officers including mr marcus have substantial influence on us consequently their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders 

 

the voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock  in general the holders of our outstanding shares of preferred stock do not have any voting rights however if full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock for six quarterly distributions periods the holders of preferred stock who have not received distributions voting together as a single class will have the right to elect two additional directors to serve on our board of directors 

 

these voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have been paid in full at that time the holders of the preferred stock are divested of these voting rights and the term and office of the directors so elected immediately terminates while any shares of our preferred stock are outstanding the company may not without the consent of the holders of twothirds of the outstanding shares of each series of preferred stock each voting separately as a single class 

 

 

 

 

 

these voting rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of our common stock 

 

the redemption rights of the series b preferred units series d preferred units series f preferred stock and series g preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of the company’s common stock  upon the occurrence of one of the following events the terms of the operating partnership’s series b and d preferred units require it to redeem all of such units and the terms of the company’s series f preferred stock and the series g preferred stock provide the holders of the majority of the outstanding series f preferred stock and series g preferred stock the right to require the company to redeem all of such stock 

 

 

 

 

 

the aggregate redemption price of the series b preferred units would be 80 million the aggregate redemption price of the series d preferred units would be 50 million the aggregate redemption price of the series f preferred stock would be 25 million and the aggregate redemption price of the series g preferred stock would be 1495 million plus in each case any accumulated distributions 

 

these redemption rights may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of holders of common stock further these redemption rights might trigger situations where the company needs to conserve its cash reserves in which event such redemption might adversely affect the company and its common holders 

 

maryland business combination law may not allow certain transactions between the company and its affiliates to proceed without compliance with such law  under maryland law “business combinations” between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these business combinations include a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities an interested stockholder is defined as any person and certain affiliates of such person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock the law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions this means that the transaction must be approved by at least 

 

 

 

the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under maryland law as permitted by the statute the board of directors of the company irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by us george m marcus william a millichap who are the chairman and a director of the company respectively and tmmc or any entity owned or controlled by messrs marcus and millichap and tmmc consequently the fiveyear prohibition and supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to any business combination between us and mr marcus mr millichap or tmmc as a result we may in the future enter into business combinations with messrs marcus and millichap and tmmc without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland general corporation law 

 

antitakeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement charter bylaws and certain provisions of maryland law could delay defer or prevent a change in control  while the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on the company’s ability to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of the company’s stockholders the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership the company cannot without first obtaining the consent of a majorityininterest of the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of our general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity such limitations on the company’s ability to act may result in our being precluded from taking action that the board of directors believes is in the best interests of the company’s stockholders as of december 31 2007 the limited partners held or controlled approximately 91 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership allowing such actions to be blocked by the limited partners 

 

the company’s charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other terms of such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock we may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control such a transaction might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock also such a class of preferred stock could have dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders of common stock 

the company’s charter as well as the company’s stockholder rights plan contains other provisions that may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of the company’s stockholders the company’s stockholder rights plan is designed among other things to prevent a person or group from gaining control of the company without offering a fair price to all of the company’s stockholders the bylaws may be amended by the board of directors to include provisions that would have a similar effect although the company presently has no such intention the charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and 

ownership of shares of capital stock which may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

the maryland general corporations law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed to be “control shares” under the maryland general corporations law “control shares” are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the company’s stockholders 

the company’s joint ventures and joint ownership of properties and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the company’s ability to control such properties and partial interests  instead of purchasing apartment communities directly we have invested and may continue to invest in joint ventures joint venture partners often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that a joint venture partner in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or our policies or objectives consequently a joint venture partners’ actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although we seek to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives we may be unable to take action without our joint venture partners’ approval or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent should a joint venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities 

 

from time to time we through the operating partnership invest in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing or managing real property in certain circumstances the operating partnership’s interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership’s objectives the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity we have and in the future may enter into transactions that could require us to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets into joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within our control occur although we plan to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on their sale pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the internal revenue code we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on our financial position 

 

dedicated investment activities and other factors specifically related to fund ii  fund ii involves risks to us such as the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we will however generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over fund ii to permit it to achieve its business objectives 

investments in mortgages and other real estate securities – the company may invest in securities related to real estate which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders the company may purchase securities issued by entities which own real estate and invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations these mortgages may be first second or third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed in general investments in mortgages include the following risks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of the above were to occur cash flows from operations and our ability to make expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected 

 

possible environmental liabilities  under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on in to or migrating from such property such laws often impose liability without regard as to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons exposed to such substances either through soil vapor or ingestion of the substances may claim personal injury damages persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility to which such substances or wastes were sent whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials “acms” into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with acms in connection with the ownership direct or indirect operation management and development of real properties the company could be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and costs related to injuries of persons and property 

 

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property we carry certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk we have conducted environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater contamination at certain properties such contamination at certain of these properties was reported to have migrated onsite from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations the former industrial users of the properties were identified as the source of contamination the environmental studies noted that certain properties are located adjacent to any possible down gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination the lateral limits of which may extend onto such properties the environmental studies also noted that at certain of these properties contamination existed because of the presence of underground fuel storage tanks which have been removed in general in connection with the ownership operation financing management and development of real properties we may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities we may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to persons and property 

 

recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements the company has been sued for mold related matters and has settled some but not all such matters which matters remain unresolved and pending insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates the company has however purchased pollution liability insurance which includes limited coverage for mold although the insurance may not cover all pending or future mold claims the company has adopted programs designed to manage the existence of mold in its properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property the company cannot assure you that it will not be sued in the future for mold related matters and cannot assure you that the liabilities resulting from such current or future mold related matters will not be substantial the costs of carrying insurance to address potential mold related claims may also be substantial 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as “proposition 65” requiring that “clear and reasonable” warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke although we have sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 65 

 

methane gas is a naturallyoccurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas particularly in the southern california coastal areas methane is a nontoxic gas but can be ignitable in confined spaces although naturallyoccurring methane gas is not regulated at the state or federal level some local governments such as the county of los angeles have imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems in areas where methane gas is known to be located 

 

methane gas is also associated with certain industrial activities such as former municipal waste landfills radon is also a naturallyoccurring gas that is found below the surface the company cannot assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas 

 

the company has almost no indemnification agreements from third parties for potential environmental cleanup costs at its properties the company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly owned by the company no assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of the properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to the company or that a material environmental condition does not exist as to any one or more of the properties the company has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described above 

 

general uninsured losses  the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the properties there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as for example losses for terrorism or earthquake for which the company does not have insurance coverage substantially all of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity in january 2007 the company canceled its then existing earthquake policy and established a wholly owned insurance subsidiary pacific western insurance llc “pwi” through pwi the company is selfinsured as it relates to earthquake related losses additionally as of january 2008 pwi provides property and casualty insurance coverage for the first 50 million of the company’s property level insurance claims per incident 

 

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its properties employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material in the event of a substantial loss insurance coverage may not be able to cover the full current market value of replacement cost of the company’s lost investment inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors might also affect the company’s ability to replace or renovate an apartment community after it has been damaged or destroyed 

 

changes in real estate tax and other laws  generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated decrease in revenue or increase in expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

 

changes in financing policy no limitation on debt – we have adopted a policy of maintaining a debttototalmarketcapitalization ratio of less than 50 the calculation of debttototalmarketcapitalization is as follows total indebtedness divided by the sum of total indebtedness plus total equity market capitalization as used in this calculation total equity market capitalization is equal to the aggregate market value of the outstanding shares of common stock based on the greater of current market price or the gross proceeds per share from public offerings of the outstanding shares plus any undistributed net cash flow assuming the conversion of all limited partnership interests in the operating partnership into shares of common stock and the gross proceeds of the preferred units and preferred stock based on this calculation including the current market price and excluding undistributed net cash flow our debttototalmarketcapitalization ratio was approximately 357 as of december 31 2007 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly the board of directors of the company could change current policies and the policies of the operating partnership regarding indebtedness if we changed these policies we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and the obligations of the operating partnership and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations such increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the properties 

 

we are subject to certain tax risks    the company has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code the company’s qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the company’s control although the company intends that its current organization and method of operation enable it to qualify as a reit the company cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions any of which could have retroactive effect could adversely the company’s ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect its stockholders if it fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year the company would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders in computing its taxable income the company may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it failed to qualify the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders and it would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders even if the company continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on its income and property 

the company has established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite the company’s qualification as a reit its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income while the company will attempt to ensure that its dealing with its taxable reit subsidiaries does not adversely affect its reit qualification the company cannot provide assurance that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore the company may be subject to a 100 penalty tax or its taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent its dealings with its taxable reit subsidiaries’ are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature no assurances can be given that the company’s dealings with its taxable reit subsidiaries’ will be arm’s length in nature 

 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then the company would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to the company from the prohibited transaction and the company’s ability to retain future gains on real property sales may be jeopardized income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect the company’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes therefore no assurances can be given that the company will be able to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

the following table summarizes the maturation or due dates of our contractual obligations and other commitments at december 31 2007 and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 

 

 

variable interest entities 

 

in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 46 revised fin 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51” the company consolidates 19 downreit limited partnerships comprising twelve properties and an office building that is subject to loans made by the company the company consolidates these entities because it is deemed the primary beneficiary under fin 46r the total assets and liabilities related to these variable interest entities vies net of intercompany eliminations were approximately 2227 million and 1639 million as of december 31 2007 and 1783 million and 1109 million as of december 31 2006 respectively interest holders in vies consolidated by the company are allocated net income equal to the cash payments made to those interest holders for services rendered or distributions from cash flow the remaining results of operations are generally allocated to the company as of december 31 2007 and 2006 the company was involved with two vies of which it is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary total assets and liabilities of these entities were approximately 717 million and 785 million and 583 million and 584 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the company does not have a significant exposure to loss from its involvement with these unconsolidated vies 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting 

principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we define critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require our management to exercise their most difficult subjective and complex judgments our critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas i consolidation under applicable accounting standards of various entities ii assessing the carrying values of our real estate properties and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates and iii internal cost capitalization the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 

 

the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie if such an entity is a vie then the company analyzes the expected losses and expected residual returns to determine who is the primary beneficiary if the company is the primary beneficiary then the entity is consolidated the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 

 

the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties an impairment charge or investment valuation charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value 

 

the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs including interest and real estate taxes incurred during development and redevelopment activities interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period included in capitalized costs are management’s estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development accounting legal fees and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under development 

 

the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 

 

forward looking statements 

 

certain statements in this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k which are not historical facts may be considered forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended including statements regarding the companys expectations hopes intentions beliefs and strategies regarding the future forward looking statements include statements regarding the companys expectations as to the timing of completion of current development and redevelopment projects and the stabilization dates of such projects expectation as to the total projected costs and rental rates of development and redevelopment projects beliefs as to the adequacy of future cash flows to meet operating requirements and to provide for dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements expectations as to the amount of capital expenditures expectations as to the amount of nonrevenue generating capital expenditures future acquisitions the companys and fund ii’s development and redevelopment pipeline the 

anticipated performance of existing properties anticipated results from various geographic regions statements regarding the companys financing activities and the use of proceeds from such activities 

 

such forwardlooking statements involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors including but not limited to that the company will fail to achieve its business objectives that the actual completion of development and redevelopment projects will be subject to delays that the stabilization dates of such projects will be delayed that the total projected costs of current development and redevelopment projects will exceed expectations  that such development and redevelopment projects will not be completed that development and redevelopment projects and acquisitions will fail to meet expectations that estimates of future income from an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate that future cash flows will be inadequate to meet operating requirements andor will be insufficient to provide for dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements that the actual nonrevenue generating capital expenditures will exceed the companys current expectations that there may be a downturn in the markets in which the companys properties are located that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness as well as those risks special considerations and other factors discussed under the caption “potential factors affecting future operating   results” below and those discussed in item 1a risk factors of this form 10k and those risk factors and special considerations set forth in the companys other filings with the securities and exchange commission the sec which may cause the actual results performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements all forwardlooking statements are made as of today and the company assumes no obligation to update this information 

 

potential factors affecting future operating results 

 

many factors affect the company’s actual financial performance and may cause the company’s future results to be different from past performance or trends these factors include those set forth under the caption “risk factors” in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k and the following 

 

development and redevelopment activities 

 

the company pursues apartment communities and development and redevelopment projects from time to time these projects generally require various government and other approvals the receipt of which cannot be assured the companys development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including the following 

 

 

 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the companys stockholders further the development and redevelopment of properties is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments 

 

interest rate fluctuations 

 

the company monitors changes in interest rates and believes that it is well positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate risk perspective however current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase rapidly to levels more in line with higher historical levels the immediate effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher interest expense on the companys variable interest rate debt the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the companys ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and the companys ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 

 

funds from operations ffo 

 

 

ffo is a financial measure that is commonly used in the reit industry essex presents funds from operations as a supplemental performance measure ffo is not used by essex nor should it be considered to be as an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of essex’s operating performance or as an alternative to cash 

from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of essex’s ability to fund its cash needs 

 

ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor does essex intend it to present a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance essex believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings further essex believes that its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 

 

in calculating ffo essex follows the definition for this measure published by the national association of reits “nareit” which is a reit trade association essex believes that under the nareit ffo definition the two most significant adjustments made to net income are i the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and ii the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of previously depreciated properties essex agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

management has consistently applied the nareit definition of ffo to all periods presented however other reits in calculating ffo may vary from the nareit definition for this measure and thus their disclosure of ffo may not be comparable to essex’s calculation 

 

the following table sets forth the company’s calculation of ffo for 2007 and 2006 in thousands except for per share data 

 

 

 

 

 

the following table sets forth the company’s cash flows for 2007 and 2006 in thousands 

 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risks 

 

interest rate hedging activities 

 

the company’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks to accomplish this objective the company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variablerate amounts in exchange for fixedrate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount as of december 31 2007 we have entered into nine forwardstarting swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in the interestrelated cash outflows on forecasted issuance of longterm debt the forwardstarting swaps are cash flow hedges of the variability of forecasted interest payments associated with the refinancing of the company’s longterm debt between 2007 and 2011 as of december 31 2007 the company also had 2331 million of variable rate indebtedness of which 1527 million is subject to interest rate cap protection all of our derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and the company does not have any fair value hedges as of december 31 2007 the following table summarizes the notional amount carrying value and estimated fair value of our derivative instruments used to hedge interest rates as of december 31 2007 the notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a particular security that is currently hedged at one time but does not represent exposure to credit interest rates or market risks the table also includes a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the impact on our derivative instruments from an increase or decrease in 10year treasury bill interest rates by 50 basis points as of december 31 2007 

 

 

interest rate sensitive liabilities 

 

the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and longterm debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company’s real estate investment portfolio and operations the company’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 

 

the company’s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows management believes that the carrying amounts of its libor debt approximates fair value as of december 31 2007 because interest rates yields and other terms for these instruments are consistent with yields and other terms currently available to the company for similar instruments management has estimated that the fair value of the 

company’s 125 billion of fixed rate mortgage notes payable and exchangeable bonds at december 31 2007 is approximately 130 billion based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable compared to those available in the marketplace 

 

 

 

1 50 million covered by a forwardstarting swap at a fixed rate of 4869 with a settlement date on or before october 1 2008 also 25 million covered by a forwardstarting swap at a fixed rate of 5082 with a settlement date on or before january 1 2009 

 

2 150 million covered by three forwardstarting swaps with fixed rates ranging from 5099 to 5824 with a settlement date on or before 

january 1 2011 

 

3 125 million covered by forwardstarting swaps with fixed rates ranging from 5655 to 58795 with a settlement date on or before february 1 2011 50 million covered by a forwardstarting swap with a fixed rate of 5535 with a settlement date on or before july 1 2011 50 million covered by a forwardstarting swap with a fixed rate of 5343 with a settlement date on or before october 1 2011 the company intends to encumber certain unencumbered assets during 2011 in conjunction with the settlement of these forwardstarting swaps 

 

4 152749 subject to interest rate caps 

 

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2007 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates

research driven approach  we believe that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio growth begin with extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge utilizing a proprietary research model that we have developed over the last two decades we continually assess markets where we currently operate as well as markets where we consider future investment opportunities by evaluating 

 

     

recognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical we regularly evaluate the results of our regional economic as well as our local market research and adjust the geographic focus of our portfolio accordingly we seek to increase our portfolio allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to decrease such allocations in markets projected to have declining economic conditions likewise the company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease such allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields 

 

property operations  we manage our properties by focusing on strategies that will generate aboveaverage rental growth tenant retentionsatisfaction and longterm asset appreciation we intend to achieve this by utilizing the strategies set forth below 

 

    

current business activities 

acquisitions 

 

acquisitions have been a significant growth component of our business during 2006 we completed a series of acquisitions that added to our overall portfolio 

 

  

  

 in december 2006 the company acquired camino ruiz square a 160unit apartment community located in camarillo california for approximately 329 million 

 

dispositions 

 

as part of our strategic plan to own quality real estate in supplyconstrained markets we continually evaluate our properties and sell those which no longer meet our strategic criteria we may use the capital generated from the dispositions to invest in higherreturn properties or repay debts we believe that the sale of these properties will not have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows nor will their sale materially affect our ongoing operations generally any impact of earnings dilution resulting from these dispositions will be offset by the positive impact of our acquisitions development and redevelopment activities

fund ii  development pipeline 

 

as of december 31 2006 the following table sets forth information regarding fund ii’s development pipeline

offices and employees 

 

the company is headquartered in palo alto california and has regional offices in woodland hills california irvine california san diego california bellevue washington and portland oregon as of december 31 2006 the company had approximately 869 employees 

 

insurance 

 

the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the properties there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as for example losses from terrorism or earthquake for which the company does not have insurance coverage 

 

substantially all of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity the company believes it has a proactive approach to its potential earthquake losses the company utilizes thirdparty seismic consultants for its acquisitions and performs seismic upgrades to those acquisitions that are determined to have a higher level of potential loss from an earthquake the company utilizes internal and thirdparty loss models to help to determine its exposure in addition the majority of the company’s properties are lower density gardenstyle apartments which may be less susceptible to earthquake damage the company will continue to monitor thirdparty earthquake insurance pricing and conditions and may consider obtaining thirdparty coverage if it deems it cost effective in the future 

 

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its properties employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material 

 

competition 

 

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our apartment communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the properties are located the properties also compete for residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale if the demand for our properties is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing properties on a more costeffective basis rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we face competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of properties some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do this competition may result in increased costs of properties we acquire andor develop 

 

working capital 

 

we believe that cash flows generated by our operations existing cash balances availability under existing lines of credit access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash gains from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2007 the timing source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment which can affect our plans for acquisitions dispositions development and redevelopment activities 

 

environmental considerations 

 

see the discussion under the caption “possible environmental liabilities” in item 1a risk factors for information concerning the potential effect of environmental regulations on our operations 

 

other matters 

 

certain policies of the company 

 

we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation under the investment company act of 1940 the company has in the past five years and may in the future i issue securities senior to its common stock ii fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and iii offer shares of common stock andor units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for property acquisitions the company from time to time acquires partnership interests in partnerships and joint ventures either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries of the company when such entities underlying assets are real estate in general the company does not i underwrite securities of other issuers or ii actively trade in loans or other investments 

we invest primarily in apartment communities that are located in predominantly coastal markets within southern california the san francisco bay area and parts of the pacific northwest the company currently intends to continue to invest in apartment communities in such regions however these practices may be reviewed and modified periodically by management 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business operating results cash flows and financial conditions are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 

 

we depend on our key personnel  our success depends on our ability to attract and retain executive officers senior officers and company managers there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

 

debt financing  at december 31 2006 we had approximately 141 billion of indebtedness including 1863 million of variable rate indebtedness of which 1828 million is subject to interest rate protection agreements we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the following 

 

      

uncertainty of our ability to refinance balloon payments  as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 141 billion of mortgage debt exchangeable bonds and line of credit borrowings most of which are subject to balloon payments we do not expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations to make all of these balloon payments these mortgages bonds and lines of credit borrowings have the following scheduled principal and balloon payments 

 

2007691 million 

20081795 million 

2009246 million 

20101569 million 

20111555 million 

thereafter7330 million 

 

we may not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness bonds or lines of credit the properties subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the lender this could cause us to lose income and asset value we may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 

 

debt financing on properties may result in insufficient cash flow  where possible we intend to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on our investments and to provide for additional investments that we could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the properties will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code we may obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all of the properties these mortgages may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized 

 

as of december 31 2006 essex had 69 of its 118 consolidated apartment communities encumbered by debt of the 69 properties 53 are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those properties with respect to the remaining 19 properties there are 4 crosscollateralized mortgages secured by 8 properties 6 properties 3 properties and 2 properties respectively the holders of this indebtedness will have claims against these properties and to the extent indebtedness is crosscollateralized lenders may seek to foreclose upon properties which are not the primary collateral for their loan this may accelerate other indebtedness secured by properties foreclosure of properties would reduce our income and net asset value 

 

risk of rising interest rates  current interest rates could potentially increase rapidly which could result in higher interest expense on our variable rate indebtedness prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and our ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 1863 million of longterm variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at floating rates tied to the rate of shortterm taxexempt revenue bonds which mature at various dates from 2020 through 2034 and 930 million of variable rate indebtedness under our lines of credit bearing interest at the freddie mac reference rate plus from 055 to 059 approximately 1828 million of the longterm indebtedness is subject to interest rate cap protection agreements which may reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates the remaining 340 million of longterm variable rate indebtedness was not subject to any interest rate cap protection agreements as of december 31 2006 an increase in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our net income and results of operations 

 

risk of losses on interest rate hedging arrangements  periodically we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates and may continue to do so although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged we may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk our policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with arated financial institutions 

 

bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain properties  at december 31 2006 we had approximately 1863 million of variable rate taxexempt financing relating to the inglenook court apartments wandering creek apartments treetops apartments huntington breakers apartments camarillo oaks apartments fountain park anchor village and parker ranch apartments this taxexempt financing subjects these properties to certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants we expect to engage in taxexempt financings in the future in addition the internal revenue code and rules and regulations thereunder impose various restrictions conditions and requirements excluding interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue code also requires that at least 20 of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed a specified percentage generally 50 of the median income for the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development department of the federal government in addition to federal requirements certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed properties if we are required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test if essex does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and we may be subject to additional contractual liability 

 

adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate investment risks  real property investments are subject to a variety of risks the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred if the properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected the performance of the economy in each of the areas in which the properties are located affects occupancy market rental rates and expenses consequently the income from the properties and their underlying values may be impacted the financial results of major local employers may have an impact on the cash flow and value of certain of the properties as well 

 

income from the properties may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

 

      

as leases on the properties expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to us income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws eg the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and tax laws interest rate levels and the availability and terms of financing real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited 

economic environment and impact on operating results  the national economy and the economies of the western states in markets where we operate can impact our operating results some of these markets are concentrated in hightech sectors which have experienced economic downturns and could again in the future our property type and diverse geographic locations provide some degree of risk mitigation however we are not immune to prolonged economic downturns although we believe we are well positioned to meet these challenges it is possible a reduction in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising turnover and repair and maintenance expense could occur in the event of economic uncertainty 

 

risk of inflationdeflation  substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses 

 

risks that acquisitions will fail to meet expectations  we intend to continue to acquire apartment communities however there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet our expectations our estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow us to market an acquired property as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate we expect to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by essex the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of essex’s existing stockholders if we finance new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless we obtain substitute financing essex may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development or such lines of credit may be not available on advantageous terms 

 

risks that development activities will be delayed not completed andor not achieve expected results  we pursue apartment community development projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals which have no assurance of being received our development activities generally entail certain risks including the following 

 

      

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to essex’s stockholders further the development of properties is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see “adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate investment risks” 

 

the geographic concentration of our properties and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact our financial condition and operating results  we generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2006 from properties concentrated in southern california los angeles ventura orange san diego and riverside counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the pacific northwest the seattle washington and portland oregon metropolitan areas as of december 31 2006 more than half 76 of our properties were located in california this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations the economic condition of these markets could affect occupancy market rental rates and expenses as well as impact the income generated from the properties and their underlying asset values the financial results of major local employers also may impact the cash flow and value of certain of the properties this could have a negative impact on our financial condition and operating results which could affect our ability to pay expected dividends to our stockholders 

 

competition in the apartment community market may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for our properties  there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our apartment communities in attracting residents these include other apartment communities and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the properties are located the properties also compete for residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale if the demand for our properties is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing properties on a more costeffective basis rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we also face competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of properties some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do this competition may result in increased costs of properties we acquire andor develop 

dividend requirements as a result of preferred stock may lead to a possible inability to sustain dividends  we have series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock “series f preferred stock” with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately 25 million outstanding and series g cumulative convertible preferred stock “series g preferred stock” with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately 1495 million outstanding in addition we are required under limited conditions to issue series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock “series b preferred stock” with an aggregate liquidation preference of 80 million and series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock “series d preferred stock” with an aggregate liquidation preference of 50 million in each case in exchange for outstanding preferred interests in the operating partnership the terms of the series b d f and g preferred stock provide for certain cumulative preferential cash distributions per each share of preferred stock 

 

these terms also provide that while such preferred stock is outstanding we cannot authorize declare or pay any distributions on our common stock unless all distributions accumulated on all shares of such preferred stock have been paid in full our failure to pay distributions on such preferred stock would impair our ability to pay dividends on our common stock our credit agreement limits our ability to pay dividends on our preferred stock if we fail to satisfy a fixed charge coverage ratio 

 

if essex wishes to issue any common stock in the future including upon the exercise of stock options the funds required to continue to pay cash dividends at current levels will be increased essex’s ability to pay dividends will depend largely upon the performance of our current properties and other properties that may be acquired or developed in the future 

 

if essex cannot pay dividends on its common stock essex’s status as a real estate investment trust may be jeopardized our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is further limited by the maryland general corporation law under the maryland general corporation law essex may not make a distribution on stock if after giving effect to such distribution either 

 

   

resale of shares pursuant to our effective registration statement or that are issued upon conversion of our convertible preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the market price of the shares  essex has the following effective registration statements which allows for the resale into the public stock of common stock held by stockholders as specified in the registration statements 

 

   

during the third quarter of 2006 we issued pursuant to a registration statement 5980000 million shares of 4875 series g cumulative preferred stock for estimated gross proceeds of 1495 million such shares are convertible subject to certain conditions into common stock which could be resold into the public market 

 

the resale of the shares of common stock pursuant to these various registration statements or that are issued upon conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares 

 

the exchange and repurchase rights of exchangeable senior notes and series g preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of common stock  the operating partnership has 225 million principal amount of 3625 exchangeable senior notes the “notes” outstanding which mature on november 1 2025 the notes are exchangeable into the companys common stock on or after november 1 2020 or prior to november 1 2020 under certain circumstances the notes are redeemable at the companys option for cash at any time on or after november 4 2010 and are subject to repurchase for cash at the option of the holder on november 1 st in the years 2010 2015 and 2020 or upon the occurrence of certain events the notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company 

in 2006 the company sold 5980000 million shares of 4875 series g cumulative convertible preferred stock the “series g preferred stock” for gross proceeds of 1495 million holders may convert series g preferred stock into shares of the company’s common stock subject to certain conditions the conversion rate will initially be 1830 shares of common stock per 25 share liquidation preference which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of 13662 per share of common stock the conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events on or after july 31 2011 the company may under certain circumstances cause some or all of the series g preferred stock to be converted into shares of common stock at the then prevailing conversion rate further if a fundamental change occurs as defined in the articles supplementary for the series g preferred stock then the holders may require essex to repurchase all or part of their series g preferred stock subject to certain conditions 

 

the exchange of the notes andor series g preferred stock for common stock would dilute stockholder ownership in the company and such exchange could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities if the notes and series g preferred stock are not exchanged the repurchase price of the notes and series g preferred stock may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of the holders of common stock further these repurchase rights may be triggered in situations where essex needs to conserve its cash reserves in which event such repurchase might adversely affect essex and its common stockholders 

 

our future issuances of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock  in order to finance our property acquisition and development activities we have issued and sold common stock preferred stock and convertible debt securities for example in 2005 the operating partnership sold 225 million principal amount of 3625 exchangeable senior notes which are exchangeable into the company’s common stock under certain conditions in 2006 the company issued 5980000 million shares of 4875 series g cumulative convertible preferred stock for gross proceeds of approximately 1495 million during 2006 pursuant to a controlled equity offering program that the company entered into with cantor fitzgerald  co the company issued and sold approximately 427700 shares of common stock for 483 million net of fees and commissions the company may in the future sell further shares of common stock pursuant to a controlled equity offering program with cantor fitzgerald  co 

 

future sales of common stock preferred stock or convertible debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 

 

our chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest  our chairman george m marcus is not an employee of essex and is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest mr marcus owns interests in various other real estaterelated businesses and investments he is the chairman of the marcus  millichap company or “tmmc” which is a holding company for certain real estate brokerage and services companies tmmc has an interest in pacific property company a company that invests in apartment communities 

 

mr marcus has agreed not to divulge any information that may be received by him in his capacity as chairman of essex to any of his affiliated companies and that he will abstain his vote on any and all resolutions by the essex board of directors regarding any proposed acquisition andor development of a multifamily property where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of his affiliated companies notwithstanding this agreement mr marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with us in acquiring andor developing multifamily properties which competition may be detrimental to us in addition due to such potential competition for real estate investments mr marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with us which may be detrimental to the interests of essex’s stockholders 

 

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock  as of december 31 2006 george m marcus the chairman of our board of directors wholly or partially owned 1759267 shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of all vested options this represents approximately 75 of the outstanding shares of our common stock mr marcus currently does not have majority control over us however he currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all our stockholders 

under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for any amendment of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with us our directors and executive officers including mr marcus have substantial influence on us consequently their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders 

 

the voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock  in general the holders of our outstanding shares of preferred stock do not have any voting rights however if full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock for six quarterly distributions periods the holders of preferred stock who have not received distributions voting together as a single class will have the right to elect two additional directors to serve on our board of directors 

 

these voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have been paid in full at that time the holders of the preferred stock are divested of these voting rights and the term and office of the directors so elected immediately terminates while any shares of our preferred stock are outstanding essex may not without the consent of the holders of twothirds of the outstanding shares of each series of preferred stock each voting separately as a single class 

 

    

these voting rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of our common stock 

 

the redemption rights of the series b preferred units series d preferred units series f preferred stock and series g preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of essex common stock    upon the occurrence of one of the following events the terms of the operating partnership’s series b and d preferred units require it to redeem all of such units and the terms of essex’s series f preferred stock and the series g preferred stock provide the holders of the majority of the outstanding series f preferred stock and series g preferred stock the right to require essex to redeem all of such stock 

 

     

the aggregate redemption price of the series b preferred units would be 80 million the aggregate redemption price of the series d preferred units would be 50 million the aggregate redemption price of the series f preferred stock would be 25 million and the aggregate redemption price of the series g preferred stock would be 1495 million plus in each case any accumulated distributions 

 

these redemption rights may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of holders of common stock further these redemption rights might trigger situations where essex needs to conserve its cash reserves in which event such redemption might adversely affect essex and its common holders 

 

maryland business combination law may not allow certain transactions between essex and its affiliates to proceed without compliance with such law  under maryland law “business combinations” between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these business combinations include a merger consolidation share exchange or in circumstances specified in the statute an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities an interested stockholder is defined as any person and certain affiliates of such person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock 

the law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions this means that the transaction must be approved by at least 

 

   

the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price as defined under maryland law as permitted by the statute the board of directors of essex irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by us george m marcus william a millichap who are the chairman and a director of essex respectively and tmmc or any entity owned or controlled by messrs marcus and millichap and tmmc consequently the fiveyear prohibition and supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to any business combination between us and mr marcus mr millichap or tmmc as a result we may in the future enter into business combinations with messrs marcus and millichap and tmmc without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland general corporation law 

 

antitakeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement charter bylaws and certain provisions of maryland law could delay defer or prevent a change in control  while essex is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on essex’s ability to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of essex’s stockholders the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership essex cannot without first obtaining the consent of a majorityininterest of the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of our general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity such limitations on essex’s ability to act may result in our being precluded from taking action that the board of directors believes is in the best interests of essex’s stockholders as of december 31 2006 the limited partners held or controlled approximately 96 of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership allowing such actions to be blocked by the limited partners 

 

essex’s charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other terms of such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock we may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control such a transaction might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock also such a class of preferred stock could have dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders of common stock 

essex’s charter as well as essex’s stockholder rights plan contains other provisions that may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of essex’s stockholders essex’s stockholder rights plan is designed among other things to prevent a person or group from gaining control of us without offering a fair price to all of essex’s stockholders the bylaws may be amended by the board of directors to include provisions that would have a similar effect although essex presently has no such intention the charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

the maryland general corporations law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed to be “control shares” 

 

under the maryland general corporations law “control shares” are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt essex from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of essex’s stockholders   

essex’s joint ventures and joint ownership of properties and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit essex’s ability to control such properties and partial interests  instead of purchasing properties directly we have invested and may continue to invest as a coventurer joint venturers often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that the coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or our policies or objectives consequently a coventurer’s actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although we seek to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives we may be unable to take action without our joint venture partners’ approval or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent should a joint venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities 

 

from time to time we through the operating partnership invest in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing or managing real property in certain circumstances the operating partnership’s interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership’s objectives the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity we have and in the future may enter into transactions that could require us to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets into joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within our control occur although we plan to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on their sale pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the internal revenue code we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on our financial position 

 

dedicated investment activities and other factors specifically related to fund ii  fund ii involves risks to us such as the following 

 

      

we will however generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over fund ii to permit it to achieve its business objectives 

 

investments in mortgages and other real estate securities  we may invest in securities related to real estate which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders we may purchase securities issued by entities which own real estate and invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations these mortgages may be first second or third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed in general investments in mortgages include the following risks 

 

     

if any of the above were to occur cash flows from operations and our ability to make expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected 

possible environmental liabilities  under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on in to or migrating from such property such laws often impose liability without regard as to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons exposed to such substances either through soil vapor or ingestion of the substances may claim personal injury damages persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility to which such substances or wastes were sent whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials “acms” into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with acms in connection with the ownership direct or indirect operation management and development of real properties the company could be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and costs related to injuries of persons and property 

 

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property we carry certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk we have conducted environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater contamination at certain properties such contamination at certain of these properties was reported to have migrated onsite from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations the former industrial users of the properties were identified as the source of contamination the environmental studies noted that certain properties are located adjacent to any possible down gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination the lateral limits of which may extend onto such properties the environmental studies also noted that at certain of these properties contamination existed because of the presence of underground fuel storage tanks which have been removed in general in connection with the ownership operation financing management and development of real properties we may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities we may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to persons and property 

 

recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements essex has been sued for mold related matters and has settled some but not all such matters which matters remain unresolved and pending insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates essex has however purchased pollution liability insurance which includes limited coverage for mold although the insurance may not cover all pending or future mold claims essex has adopted programs designed to manage the existence of mold in its properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property essex cannot assure you that it will not be sued in the future for mold related matters and cannot assure you that the liabilities resulting from such current or future mold related matters will not be substantial the costs of carrying insurance to address potential mold related claims may also be substantial 

 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as “proposition 65” requiring that “clear and reasonable” warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke although we have sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 65 

 

methane gas is a naturallyoccurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas particularly in the southern california coastal areas methane is a nontoxic gas but can be ignitable in confined spaces although naturallyoccurring methane gas is not regulated at the state or federal level some local governments such as the county of los angeles have imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems in areas where methane gas is known to be located 

 

methane gas is also associated with certain industrial activities such as former municipal waste landfills radon is also a naturallyoccurring gas that is found below the surface essex cannot assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas 

 

the company has almost no indemnification agreements from third parties for potential environmental cleanup costs at its properties 

the company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly owned by the company no assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of the properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to the company or that a material environmental condition does not exist as to any one or more of the properties the company has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described above 

 

general uninsured losses  the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the properties there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as for example losses for terrorism or earthquake for which the company does not have insurance coverage substantially all of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity in january 2007 the company canceled the earthquake policy and established a wholly owned insurance subsidiary through this subsidiary the company is selfinsured as it relates to earthquake related losses 

 

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its properties employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material 

 

changes in real estate tax and other laws  generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

 

changes in financing policy no limitation on debt  we have adopted a policy of maintaining for a debttototalmarketcapitalization ratio of less than 50 the calculation of debttototalmarketcapitalization is as follows total indebtedness divided by the sum of total indebtedness plus total equity market capitalization as used in this calculation total equity market capitalization is equal to the aggregate market value of the outstanding shares of common stock based on the greater of current market price or the gross proceeds per share from public offerings of the outstanding shares plus any undistributed net cash flow assuming the conversion of all limited partnership interests in the operating partnership into shares of common stock and the gross proceeds of the preferred units based on this calculation including the current market price and excluding undistributed net cash flow our debttototalmarketcapitalization ratio was approximately 28 as of december 31 2006 

 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly the board of directors of essex could change current policies and the policies of the operating partnership regarding indebtedness if we changed these policies we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and the obligations of the operating partnership and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations such increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the properties 

 

we are subject to certain tax risks    essex has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code essex’s qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within essex’s control although essex intends that its current organization and method of operation enable it to qualify as a reit it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions any of which could have retroactive effect could adversely affect essex’s ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect its stockholders if it fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year essex would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders in computing its taxable income essex may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it failed to qualify the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders and it would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders even if essex continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on its income and property 

essex has established several taxable reit subsidiaries “trss” despite essex’s qualification as a reit its trss’ must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income while essex will attempt to ensure that their dealing with its trss’ does not adversely affect its reit qualification it cannot provide assurance that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore essex may be subject to a 100 penalty tax or its trss’ may be denied deductions to the extent its dealings with its trss’ are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature no assurances can be given that essex’s dealings with its trss’ will be arm’s length in nature 

 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then essex would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to essex from the prohibited transaction and essex’s ability to retain future gains on real property sales may be jeopardized income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect essex’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes therefore no assurances can be given that essex will be able to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit

the 130 apartment communities had an average sameproperties occupancy as defined in item 7 based on “financial occupancy” during the year ended december 31 2006 of approximately 964  with respect to stabilized apartment communities with sufficient operating history occupancy figures are based on financial occupancy the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue actual rental revenue represents contractual revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of financial occupancy 

 

as of december 31 2006 the headquarters building was 100 occupied by the company and the southern california office building was 95 occupied based on physical occupancy with respect to office buildings occupancy figures are based on “physical occupancy” which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied square footage by rentable square footage with respect to recreational vehicle parks manufactured housing communities or apartment communities which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient operating history occupancy figures are based on “physical occupancy” which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied units by rentable units

variable interest entities 

 

consolidated variable interest entities 

 

in accordance fin 46r the company consolidates 17 down reit limited partnerships comprising ten properties an office building that is subject to loans made by the company and building improvements owned by a thirdparty in which the company owns the land underlying the improvements and from which the company receives land lease payments subordination and property management fees the company consolidated these entities because it is deemed the primary beneficiary under fin 46r the companys total assets and liabilities related to these variable interest entities vies net of intercompany eliminations were approximately 2695 million and 1455 million respectively at december 31 2006 and 2309 million and 1467 million respectively at december 31 2005 

 

interest holders in vies consolidated by the company are allocated net income equal to the cash payments made to those interest holders for services rendered or distributions from cash flow the remaining results of operations are generally allocated to the company 

 

properties consolidated in accordance with fin 46r were encumbered by third party nonrecourse loans totaling 1403 million and 1418 million as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we define critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require our management to exercise their most difficult subjective and complex judgments our critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas i consolidation under applicable accounting standards of various entities ii assessing the carrying values of our real estate properties and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates and iii internal cost capitalization the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 

 

the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie if such an entity is a vie then the company analyzes the expected losses and expected residual returns to determine who is the primary beneficiary if the company is the primary beneficiary then the entity is consolidated the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 

rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation components on rental properties have been provided over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 30 years using the straightline method development costs include acquisition direct and indirect construction costs interest and real estate taxes incurred during the construction and property stabilizations periods maintenance and repair expenses that do not add to the value or prolong the useful life of the property are expensed as incurred asset replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

 

the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties an impairment charge or investment valuation charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value 

 

the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs including interest and real estate taxes incurred during development and redevelopment activities interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period included in capitalized costs are management’s estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development accounting legal fees and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under development 

 

the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions

potential factors affecting future operating results 

 

many factors affect the company’s actual financial performance and may cause the company’s future results to be different from past performance or trends these factors include those set forth under the caption “risk factors” in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k and the following 

 

development and redevelopment activities 

 

the company pursues multifamily residential properties and development and redevelopment projects from time to time these projects generally require various government and other approvals the receipt of which cannot be assured the companys development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including the following 

 

 

 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the companys stockholders further the development and redevelopment of properties is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments 

 

interest rate fluctuations 

 

the company monitors changes in interest rates and believes that it is well positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate risk perspective however current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase rapidly to levels more in line with higher historical levels the immediate effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher interest expense on the companys variable interest rate debt the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the companys ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and the companys ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 

 

funds from operations ffo 

 

ffo is a financial measure that is commonly used in the reit industry essex presents funds from operations as a supplemental performance measure ffo is not used by essex nor should it be considered to be as an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of essex’s operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of essex’s ability to fund its cash needs 

 

ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor does essex intend it to present a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance essex believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings further essex believes that its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 

in calculating ffo essex follows the definition for this measure published by the national association of reits “nareit” which is a reit trade association essex believes that under the nareit ffo definition the two most significant adjustments made to net income are i the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and ii the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of previously depreciated properties essex agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

 

 

 

 

 

management has consistently applied the nareit definition of ffo to all periods presented however other reits in calculating ffo may vary from the nareit definition for this measure and thus their disclosure of ffo may not be comparable to essex’s calculation 

 

the following table sets forth the company’s calculation of ffo for 2006 and 2005 in thousands except for per share data

the company’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks to accomplish this objective the company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variablerate amounts in exchange for fixedrate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount as of december 31 2006 we have entered into nine forwardstarting swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in the interestrelated cash outflows on forecasted issuance of longterm debt the forwardstarting swaps are cash flow hedges of the variability in ten years of forecasted interest payments associated with the refinancing of the company’s longterm debt between 2007 and 2011 as of december 31 2006 the company also had 1863 million of variable rate indebtedness of which 1828 million is subject to interest rate cap protection all of our derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and the company does not have any fair value hedges as of december 31 2006 the following table summarizes the notional amount carrying value and estimated fair value of our derivative instruments used to hedge interest rates as of december 31 2006 the notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a particular security that is currently hedged at one time but does not represent exposure to credit interest rates or market risks the table also includes a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the impact on our derivative instruments from an increase or decrease in libor by 50 basis points as of december 31 2006 

 

 

 

interest rate sensitive liabilities 

 

the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and longterm debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company’s real estate investment portfolio and operations the company’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 

 

the company’s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows management believes that the carrying amounts of its libor debt approximates fair value as of december 31 2006 because interest rates yields and other terms for these instruments are consistent with yields and other terms currently available to the company for similar instruments management has estimated that the fair value of the 

company’s 113 billion of fixed rate mortgage notes payable and exchangeable bonds at december 31 2006 is approximately 122 billion based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable compared to those available in the marketplace 

 

 

1 50 million covered by a forwardstarting swap at a fixed rate of 4927 with a settlement date on or before october 1 2007 

 

2 50 million covered by a forwardstarting swap at a fixed rate of 4869 with a settlement date on or before october 1 2008 also 25 million covered by a forwardstarting swap at a fixed rate of 5082 with a settlement date on or before january 1 2009 

 

3 150 million covered by three forwardstarting swaps with fixed rates ranging from 5099 to 5824 with a settlement date on or before 

january 1 2011 

 

4 125 million covered by forwardstarting swaps with fixed rates ranging from 5655 to 58795 with a settlement date on or before february 1 2011 50 million covered by a forwardstarting swap with a fixed rate of 5535 with a settlement date on or before july 1 2011 the company intends to encumber certain unencumbered assets during 2011 in conjunction with the settlement of these forwardstarting swaps 

 

5 182849 subject to interest rate caps 

 

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2006 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates

business objectives and strategies 

the following is a discussion of our business objectives and strategies with respect to real estate investment and management one or more of these criteria may be amended or rescinded from time to time without stockholder vote 

 

business objectives 

 

our primary business objectives are to increase shareholders’ value by investing in properties located in supply constrained markets improving operating results and the value of our properties while maintaining a conservative balance sheet we intend to achieve these objectives by 

 

 

 

 

 

we can not assure that we will achieve our business objectives 

business strategies 

 

research driven approach  we believe that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio growth begin with extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge utilizing a proprietary research model that we have developed over the last 19 years we continually assess markets where we currently operate as well as markets where we would consider future investment opportunities by evaluating 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical we regularly evaluate the results of our regional economic as well as our local market research and adjust the geographic focus of our portfolio accordingly we seek to increase our portfolio allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to decrease such allocations in markets projected to have declining economic conditions likewise the company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease such allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields 

 

property operations  we manage our properties by focusing on and marketing strategies that will generate aboveaverage rental growth tenant retentionsatisfaction and longterm asset appreciation we intend to achieve this by utilizing the strategies set forth below 

 

 

 

 

current business activities 

 

acquisitions 

 

acquisitions have been a significant growth component of our business in 2005 we completed in addition to acquisitions by the essex apartment value fund ii “fund ii” discussed below a series of acquisitions that added to our overall portfolio 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in january 2006 we acquired two apartment communities  chimney sweep and cbc aggregating 239 units located in isla vista california for a combined price of approximately 571 million 

dispositions 

 

as part of our strategic plan to own quality real estate in supplyconstrained markets we continually evaluate our properties and sell those which no longer meet our strategic criteria we may use the capital generated from the dispositions to invest in higherreturn properties or repay debts we believe that the sale of these properties will not have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows nor will their sale materially affect our ongoing operations generally any impact of earnings dilution resulting from these dispositions will be offset by the positive impact of our acquisitions development and redevelopment activities 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

development 

 

development communities are defined as new apartment properties that are being constructed or are newly constructed and in a phase of leaseup and have not reached 95 physical occupancy stabilized operations in the first quarter of 2005 we stabilized the second phase of development at san marcos which is located in richmond california total construction costs for the 120 units were approximately 239 million 

 

in connection with the properties currently under development we have entered into contractual constructionrelated commitments with unrelated third parties as of december 31 2005 we are committed to approximately 966 million in estimated development expenditures to complete these projects 

 

as of december 31 2005 we had three development projects in various stages of construction and other predevelopment costs in our pipeline with combined estimated costs of 1337 million the following table sets forth information regarding the company’s development communities at december 31 2005 

 

1 includes incurred costs and estimated costs to complete the development projects 

 

redevelopment 

 

redevelopment is defined as investment on existing properties with the expectation of increased financial returns through property improvement during redevelopment certain apartment units typically are not available for rent and as a result may have less than stabilized operations as of december 31 2005 we had ownership interests in six redevelopment communities aggregating 1450 apartment units with estimated redevelopment costs of 368 million of which approximately 235 million remains to be expended 

the following table illustrates those redevelopment projects 

 

 

debt transactions 

 

on february 1 2005 we obtained a nonrecourse mortgage on a previously unencumbered property in the amount of 218 million with a 494 fixed interest rate for a 9year term maturing in march 2014 with an option to extend the maturity for one year thereafter at a floating rate of 24 over one month libor during the extension period the loan may be paid in full with no prepayment penalty 

 

on april 15 2005 we obtained two nonrecourse mortgage loans on previously unencumbered properties in the aggregate amount of 329 million with fixed interest rates of 544 that mature on may 1 2014 

 

on may 19 2005 we obtained three nonrecourse mortgage loans in the aggregate amount of 129 million secured by second deeds of trusts with an average interest rate of 532 and maturity dates ranging from may 1 2009 to january 1 2013 

 

on july 14 2005 we obtained a nonrecourse mortgage loan on previously unencumbered property in the aggregate amount of 403 million with a fixed interest rate of 4935 for a 10year term that matures on august 1 2015 

 

during october and november 2005 the operating partnership raised 225 million from the sale of exchangeable senior notes the “notes” with a coupon of 3625 due 2025 on or after november 1 2020 the notes will be exchangeable at the option of the holder into cash and in certain circumstances at essex’s option shares of the company’s common stock at an initial exchange price of 10325 per share subject to certain adjustments the notes will also be exchangeable prior to november 1 2020 but only upon the occurrence of certain specified events on or after november 4 2010 the operating partnership may redeem all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest note holders may require the operating partnership to repurchase all or a portion of the notes at a purchase price equal to the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest including additional interest if any on the notes on november 1 2010 november 1 2015 and november 1 2020 

 

with the proceeds from the sale of the notes the company repurchased 25 million in common stock and paid down 135 million on the outstanding lines of credit in part using proceeds from the sale of the notes i n the fourth quarter of 2005 the company paidoff ten mortgage notes payable totaling 89 million with fixed rates ranging from 65 to 79 and the company originated two new mortgage notes payable totaling 35 million with fixed rates of 55 and 56 

 

derivative transactions 

 

to hedge the cash flows associated with the refinancings of a portion of the debt that matures in 2007 and 2008 the company entered into the following contracts 

 

 

 

 

we believe that these transactions will be effective in offsetting changes in future cash flows for forecasted transactions and qualify for hedge accounting the increase in the fair value of these derivatives during 2005 was approximately 660000 and is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in the company’s consolidated financial statements 

 

on february 22 2006 the company entered into additional notional forwardstarting swaps the first was for 250 million with a commercial bank at a fixed rate of 5082 and a settlement date on or before january 1 2009 the second and third swaps are for a total of 1000 million with two commercial banks at a fixed rate of 5099 and a settlement date on or before january 1 2011 these derivatives will be used to economically hedge the cash flows associated with the refinancing of debt that matures in 2008 and 2010 respectively 

 

equity transactions 

 

the company repurchased 25 million of common stock in conjunction with our exchangeable bond offering in the fourth quarter of 2005 the company also granted stock options and certain employees exercised their options pursuant to the company’s stock incentive plan 

 

essex apartment value funds 

essex and several institutional partners formed essex apartment value fund “fund i” to broaden the company’s capital alternatives essex is a 1 general partner and 204 limited partner in fund i fund i was in the process of liquidation as of december 31 2005 essex apartment value fund ii “fund ii” was formed in 2004 and essex is a 1 general partner and 272 limited partner fund ii is the company’s investment vehicle subject to certain exceptions until october 31 2006 or when fund ii’s capital has been invested whichever occurs first 

 

acquisitions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dispositions 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

offices and employees 

the company is headquartered in palo alto california and has regional offices in woodland hills california irvine california san diego california bellevue washington and portland oregon as of december 31 2005 the company had approximately 820 employees 

 

insurance 

the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the properties there are however certain types of extraordinary losses such as for example losses for terrorism or earthquake for which the company may not have sufficient insurance coverage 

substantially all of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity the company has obtained earthquake insurance for most the properties most of the properties are included in an earthquake insurance program that is subject to an aggregate limit of 800 million payable upon a covered loss in excess of a 150 million selfinsured retention amount and a 5 deductible in the future the company may selectively exclude properties from being covered by earthquake insurance based on managements evaluation of the following factors i the availability of coverage on terms acceptable to the company ii the location of the property and the amount of seismic activity affecting that region and iii the age of the property and building codes in effect at the time of construction despite earthquake coverage on most of the companys properties should a property sustain damage as a result of an earthquake the company may incur losses due to deductibles copayments and losses in excess of applicable insurance if any 

 

although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its properties employees residents and compliance with applicable laws it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage 

 

competition 

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our multifamily properties in attracting residents these include other multifamily rental apartments and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the properties are located the properties also compete for residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale if the demand for our properties is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing properties on a more costeffective basis rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we face competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of properties some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do this competition may result in increased costs of properties we acquire andor develop 

 

working capital 

we believe that cash flows generated by our operations existing cash balances availability under existing lines of credit access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash gains from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2006 the timing source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment which can affect our plans for acquisitions dispositions development and redevelopment activities 

 

environmental considerations 

see the discussion under the caption “ possible environmental liabilities ” in item 1a risk factors for information concerning the potential effect of environmental regulations on our operations 

 

other matters 

 

certain policies of the company 

 

we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation under the investment company act of 1940 the company has in the past five years and may in the future i issue securities senior to its common stock ii fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and iii offer shares of common stock andor units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for property acquisitions the company from time to time acquires partnership interests in partnerships and joint ventures either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries of the company when such entities underlying assets are real estate in general the company does not i underwrite securities of other issuers or ii actively trade in loans or other investments 

 

we invest primarily in multifamily properties that are located in predominantly coastal markets within southern california the san francisco bay area and parts of pacific northwest the company currently intends to continue to invest in multifamily properties in such regions however these practices may be reviewed and modified periodically by the board of directors and may change these practices without shareholder approval  




 item 1a risk factors 

 

our business operating results cash flows and financial conditions are subject to various risks and uncertainties including without limitation those set forth below any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or form our anticipated future results 

 

we depend on our key personnel  our success depends on our ability to attract and retain executive officers senior officers and company managers there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 

 

debt financing  at december 31 2005 we had approximately 135 billion of indebtedness including 1867 million of variable rate indebtedness of which 1527 million is subject to interest rate protection agreements we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

uncertainty of our ability to refinance balloon payments  as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 135 billion of mortgage debt exchangeable bonds and line of credit borrowings most of which are subject to balloon payments we do not expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations to make all of these balloon payments these mortgages bonds and lines of credit borrowings have the following scheduled principal and balloon payments 

 

2006262 million 

2007820 million 

20081557 million 

2009344 million 

20101593 million 

thereafter8722 million 

 

we may not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness bonds or lines of credit the properties subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the lender this could cause us to lose income and asset value we may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates or terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 

 

debt financing on properties may result in insufficient cash flow  where possible we intend to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on our investments and to provide for additional investments that we could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the properties will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code we may obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all of the properties these mortgages may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized 

 

as of december 31 2005 essex had 72 of its 120 consolidated multifamily properties encumbered by debt of the 72 properties 53 are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those properties with respect to the remaining 19 properties there are 4 crosscollateralized mortgages secured by 8 properties 6 properties 3 properties and 2 properties respectively the holders of this indebtedness will have a claim against these properties and to the extent indebtedness is crosscollateralized lenders may seek to foreclose upon properties which are not the primary collateral for their loan this may accelerate other indebtedness secured by properties foreclosure of properties would reduce our income and asset value 

 

risk of rising interest rates  current interest rates are at historic lows and could potentially increase rapidly which could result in higher interest expense on our variable rate indebtedness prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and our ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 

 

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 1867 million of longterm variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at floating rates tied to the rate of shortterm taxexempt revenue bonds which mature at various dates from 2020 through 2034 and 250 million of variable rate indebtedness under our lines of credit bearing interest at the freddie mac reference rate plus from 055 to 059 

approximately 1527 million of the longterm indebtedness is subject to interest rate cap protection agreements which may reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates the remaining 340 million of longterm variable rate indebtedness was not subject to any interest rate cap protection agreements as of december 31 2005 an increase in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our net income and results of operations 

 

risk of losses on interest rate hedging arrangement  periodically we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates and may continue to do so although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates they also may reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged we may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk our policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with large financial institutions 

 

bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain properties  at december 31 2005 we had approximately 1867 million of variable rate taxexempt financing relating to the inglenook court apartments wandering creek apartments treetops apartments huntington breakers apartments camarillo oaks apartments fountain park anchor village and parker ranch apartments this taxexempt financing subjects these properties to certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants we expect to engage in taxexempt financings in the future in addition the internal revenue code and rules and regulations thereunder impose various restrictions conditions and requirements excluding interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue code also requires that at least 20 of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed a specified percentage generally 50 of the median income for the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development department of the federal government in addition to federal requirements certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed properties if we are required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test if essex does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements the taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and we may be subject to additional contractual liability 

 

adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate investment risks  real property investments are subject to a variety of risks the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred if the properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected the performance of the economy in each of the areas in which the properties are located affects occupancy market rental rates and expenses consequently the income from the properties and their underlying values may be impacted the financial results of major local employers may have an impact on the cash flow and value of certain of the properties as well 

 

income from the properties may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

as leases on the properties expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to us income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws eg the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and tax laws interest rate levels and the availability and terms of financing real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited 

 

economic environment and impact on operating results  the national economy and the economies of the western states in markets where we operate can impact our operating results some of these markets are concentrated in hightech sectors which have experienced economic downturns and could again in the future our property type and diverse geographic locations provide some degree of risk mitigation however we are not immune to prolonged economic downturns although we believe we are well positioned to meet these challenges it is possible a reduction in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising turnover and repair and maintenance expense could occur in the event of economic uncertainty 

risk of inflationdeflation  substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses 

 

risks that acquisitions will fail to meet expectations  we intend to continue to acquire multifamily residential properties however there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet our expectations our estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow us to market an acquired property as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate we expect to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by essex the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of essex’s existing stockholders if we finance new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless we obtain substitute financing essex may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development or such lines of credit may be not available on advantageous terms 

 

risks that development activities will be delayed not completed andor not achieve expected results  these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to essex’s stockholders further the development of properties is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see “adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate investment risks” 

 

we pursue multifamily residential property development projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals which have no assurance of being received our development activities generally entail certain risks including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the geographic concentration of our properties and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact our financial condition and operating results  we generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 from properties concentrated in southern california los angeles ventura orange san diego and riverside counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the pacific northwest the seattle washington and portland oregon metropolitan areas as of december 31 2005 more than half 73 of our properties were located in california this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations the economic condition of these markets could affect occupancy market rental rates and expenses as well as impact the income generated from the properties and their underlying asset values the financial results of major local employers also may impact the cash flow and value of certain of the properties this could have a negative impact on our financial condition and operating results which could affect our ability to pay expected dividends to our stockholders 

 

competition in the multifamily residential market may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for our properties  there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our multifamily properties in attracting residents these include other multifamily rental apartments and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the properties are located the properties also compete for residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale if the demand for our properties is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing properties on a more costeffective basis rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we also face competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of properties some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do this competition may result in increased costs of properties we acquire andor develop 

 

dividend requirements as a result of preferred stock may lead to a possible inability to sustain dividends  the company has approximately 25 million of series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock “series f preferred stock” outstanding the series b preferred units the series d preferred units and the series f preferred stock are collectively referred to as the “preferred equity” the terms of the series f preferred stock and of the preferred stock into which each series of preferred units are exchangeable provide for certain cumulative preferential cash distributions per each share of preferred stock 

these terms also provide that while such preferred stock is outstanding essex cannot authorize declare or pay any distributions on the common stock unless all distributions accumulated on all shares of such preferred stock have been paid in full the distributions payable on such preferred stock may impair essex’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock 

 

if essex wishes to issue any common stock in the future including upon exercise of stock options the funds required to continue to pay cash dividends at current levels will be increased essex’s ability to pay dividends will depend largely upon the performance of the properties and other properties that may be acquired or developed in the future 

 

if essex cannot pay dividends on its stock essex’s status as a real estate investment trust may be jeopardized our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is further limited by the maryland general corporation law under the maryland general corporation law essex may not make a distribution on stock if after giving effect to such distribution either 

 

 

 

 

resale of shares pursuant to our effective registration statement may have an adverse effect on the market price of the shares  pursuant to the acquisition of john m sachs inc a real estate company in december 2002 we issued 2719875 shares of common stock as partial consideration for the acquisition to the trusts that were the shareholders of that company in connection with the acquisition essex entered into a registration rights agreement with these trusts pursuant to which in january 2003 we filed a registration statement on form s3 in order to enable the resale of these shares of common stock in an amendment to this registration statement filed in april 2003 we also registered pursuant to certain registration rights 50000 shares of common stock which are issuable to the trusts in connection with certain contractual obligations and 2270490 shares of common stock which are issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership these limited partnership interests are held by senior members of our management certain members of our board of directors and certain outside investors or the operating partnership holders and comprise approximately 96 of the limited partnership interests of the operating partnership as of december 31 2005 in the 2003 registration statement we registered pursuant to certain registration rights 1473125 shares of common stock which are issuable upon redemption of all of the limited partnership interests in such real estate partnerships in total this 2003 registration statement covers in aggregate 6513490 shares of our common stock in january 2006 we filed registration statements that cover 1 the resale of up to 142076 shares issuable in connection with our waterford and vista belvedere acquisitions and 2 the resale of shares issuable in connection with the exchange rights of our 3625 senior exchangeable notes as to which there is a principal amount of 225 million outstanding the resale of the shares of common stock pursuant to these various registration statements may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares 

 

the exchange and repurchase rights of exchangeable senior notes may be detrimental to holders of common stock  the operating partnership has 225 million principal amount of 3625 exchangeable senior notes the “notes” outstanding which mature on november 1 2025 the notes are exchangeable into the companys common shares on or after november 1 2020 or prior to november 1 2020 under certain circumstances the notes are redeemable at the companys option for cash at any time on or after november 4 2010 and are subject to repurchase for cash at the option of the holder on november 1 st in the years 2010 2015 and 2020 or upon the occurrence of certain events the notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company the exchange of notes for common stock would dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities if the notes are not exchanged the repurchase rights of holder of the notes may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of holders of common stock further these repurchase rights might be triggered in situations where essex needs to conserve its cash reserves in which event such repurchase might adversely affect essex and its common holders 

 

our chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest  our chairman george m marcus is not an employee of essex and is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest mr marcus owns interests in various other real estaterelated businesses and investments he is the chairman of the marcus  millichap company or “tmmc” which is a holding company for certain real estate brokerage and services companies tmmc has an interest in pacific property company a company that invests in west coast multifamily residential properties in 1999 we sold an office building to tmmc which essex previously occupied as its corporate headquarters 

 

mr marcus has agreed not to divulge any information that may be received by him in his capacity as chairman of essex to any of his affiliated companies and that he will abstain his vote on any and all resolutions by the essex board of directors regarding any proposed acquisition andor development of a multifamily property where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of his affiliated companies 

notwithstanding this agreement mr marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with us in acquiring andor developing multifamily properties which competition may be detrimental to us in addition due to such potential competition for real estate investments mr marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with us which may be detrimental to the interests of essex’s stockholders 

 

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock  as of december 31 2005 george m marcus the chairman of our board of directors wholly or partially owned 1752111 shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of all vested options this represents approximately 76 of the outstanding shares of our common stock mr marcus currently does not have majority control over us however he currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all our stockholders 

 

under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for any amendment of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with us our directors and executive officers including mr marcus and mr william a millichap a director of essex have substantial influence on us consequently their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders 

 

the voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock  in general the holders of series f preferred stock and of the preferred stock into which our preferred units are exchangeable do not have any voting rights however if full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock for six quarterly distributions periods the holders of preferred stock who have not received distributions voting together as a single class will have the right to elect two additional directors to serve on essex’s board of directors these voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have been paid in full at that time the holders of the preferred stock are divested of these voting rights and the term and office of the directors so elected immediately terminates 

 

these voting rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of essex’s common stock while any shares of series f preferred stock or shares of preferred stock into which the preferred units are exchangeable are outstanding essex may not without the consent of the holders of twothirds of the outstanding shares of each series of preferred stock each voting separately as a single class 

 

 

 

 

 

the redemption rights of the series b preferred units series d preferred units and series f preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of essex common stock  upon the occurrence of one of the following events the terms of the operating partnership’s series b and d preferred units require it to redeem all of such units and the terms of essex’s series f preferred stock provide the holders of the majority of the outstanding series f preferred stock the right to require essex to redeem all of such stock 

 

 

 

 

 

the aggregate redemption price of the series b preferred units would be 80 million the aggregate redemption price of the series d preferred units would be 50 million and the aggregate redemption price of the series f preferred stock would be 25 million plus in each case any accumulated distributions 

these redemption rights may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of holders of common stock further these redemption rights might trigger situations where essex needs to conserve its cash reserves in which event such redemption might adversely affect essex and its common holders 

 

maryland business combination law may not allow certain transactions between essex and its affiliates to proceed without compliance with such law  the maryland general corporation law establishes special requirements for “business combinations” between a maryland corporation and “interested stockholders” unless exemptions are applicable an interested stockholder is any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock 

 

the law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions this means that the transaction must be approved by at least 

 

 

 

 

however as permitted by the statute the board of directors of essex irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by us george m marcus william a millichap who are the chairman and a director of essex respectively and tmmc or any entity owned or controlled by messrs marcus and millichap and tmmc consequently the supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to any business combination between us and mr marcus mr millichap or tmmc as a result we may in the future enter into business combinations with messrs marcus and millichap and tmmc without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland general corporation law 

 

antitakeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement charter bylaws and certain provisions of maryland law could delay defer or prevent a change in control  while essex is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on essex’s ability to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of essex’s stockholders the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership essex cannot without first obtaining the consent of a majorityininterest of the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of our general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity such limitations on essex’s ability to act may result in our being precluded from taking action that the board of directors believes is in the best interests of essex’s stockholders as of december 31 2005 george m marcus held or controlled more than 50 of the outstanding units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership allowing such actions to be blocked the limited partner 

 

essex’s charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other terms of such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock we may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control such a transaction might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock also such a class of preferred stock could have dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders of common stock 

 

essex’s charter as well as essex’s stockholder rights plan contains other provisions that may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of essex’s stockholders essex’s stockholder rights plan is designed among other things to prevent a person or group from gaining control of us without offering a fair price to all of essex’s stockholders the bylaws may be amended by the board of directors to include provisions that would have a similar effect although essex presently has no such intention the charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

 

the maryland general corporations law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed to be “control shares” 

under the maryland general corporations law “control shares” are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt essex from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of essex’s stockholders 

 

essex’s joint ventures and joint ownership of properties and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit essex’s ability to control such properties and partial interests  instead of purchasing properties directly we have invested and may continue to invest as a coventurer joint venturers often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that the coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or our policies or objectives consequently a coventurer’s actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although we seek to maintain sufficient influence of any joint venture to achieve its objectives we may be unable to take action without our joint venture partners’ approval or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without consent should a joint venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for such partner’s share of joint venture liabilities 

 

from time to time we through the operating partnership invest in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing or managing real property in certain circumstances the operating partnership’s interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnership’s ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership’s objectives the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity we have and in the future may enter into transactions that could require us to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets into joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within our control occur although we plan to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on their sale pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the internal revenue code we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on our financial position 

 

dedicated investment activities and other factors specifically related to fund ii   fund ii involves risks to us such as the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we will however generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over fund ii to permit it to achieve its business objectives 

 

investments in mortgages and other real estate securities  we may invest in securities related to real estate which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders we may purchase securities issued by entities which own real estate and invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations these mortgages may be first second or third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed in general investments in mortgages include the following risks 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any of the above were to occur cash flows from operations and our ability to make expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected 

 

possible environmental liabilities  under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on in to or migrating from such property such laws often impose liability without regard as to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons exposed to such substances either through soil vapor or ingestion of the substances may claim personal injury damages persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility to which such substances or wastes were sent whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials “acms” into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with acms in connection with the ownership direct or indirect operation management and development of real properties the company could be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and costs related to injuries of persons and property 

 

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property we carry certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk we have conducted environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater contamination at certain properties such contamination at certain of these properties was reported to have migrated onsite from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations the former industrial users of the properties were identified as the source of contamination the environmental studies noted that certain properties are located adjacent to any possible down gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination the lateral limits of which may extend onto such properties the environmental studies also noted that at certain of these properties contamination existed because of the presence of underground fuel storage tanks which have been removed in general in connection with the ownership operation financing management and development of real properties we may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities we may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to persons and property 

 

recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements essex has been sued for mold related matters and has settled some but not all such matters which matters remain unresolved and pending insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates essex has however purchased pollution liability insurance which includes limited coverage for mold although the insurance may not cover all pending or future mold claims essex has adopted programs designed to manage the existence of mold in its properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property essex cannot assure you that it will not be sued in the future for mold related matters not can it assure you that the liabilities resulting from such current or future mold related matters will not be substantial the costs of carrying insurance to address potential mold related claims may also be substantial 

 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as “proposition 65” requiring that “clear and reasonable” warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke although we have sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 65 

 

methane gas is a naturallyoccurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas particularly in the southern california coastal areas methane is a nontoxic gas but can be ignitable in confined spaces although naturallyoccurring methane gas is not regulated at the state or federal level some local governments such as the county of los angeles have imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems in areas where methane gas is known to be located 

methane gas is also associated with certain industrial activities such as former municipal waste landfills radon is also a naturallyoccurring gas that is found below the surface essex cannot assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas 

 

except with respect to three properties the company has no indemnification agreements from third parties for potential environmental cleanup costs at its properties the company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly owned by the company no assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of the properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to the company or that a material environmental condition does not exist as to any one or more of the properties the company has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described above 

 

general uninsured losses  we have a comprehensive insurance program covering our property and operating activities there are however certain types of extraordinary losses for which we may not have insurance accordingly we may sustain uninsured losses due to insurance deductibles selfinsured retention uninsured claims or casualties or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

 

changes in real estate tax and other laws  generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 

 

changes in financing policy no limitation on debt  we have adopted a policy of maintaining a debttototalmarketcapitalization ratio of less than 50 the calculation of debttototalmarketcapitalization is as follows total property indebtedness divided by the sum of total property indebtedness plus total equity market capitalization as used in this calculation total equity market capitalization is equal to the aggregate market value of the outstanding shares of common stock based on the greater of current market price or the gross proceeds per share from public offerings of the outstanding shares plus any undistributed net cash flow assuming the conversion of all limited partnership interests in the operating partnership into shares of common stock and the gross proceeds of the preferred units based on this calculation including the current market price and excluding undistributed net cash flow our debttototalmarketcapitalization ratio was approximately 35 as of december 31 2005 

 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly the board of directors of essex could change current policies and the policies of the operating partnership regarding indebtedness if we changed these policies we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and the obligations of the operating partnership and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations such increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the properties 

 

we are subject to certain tax risks    essex has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code essex’s qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within essex’s control although essex intends that its current organization and method of operation enable it to qualify as a reit it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions any of which could have retroactive effect could adversely affect essex’s ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect its stockholders if it fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year essex would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at corporate rates and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders in computing its taxable income essex may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it failed to qualify the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders and it would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders even if essex continues to qualify as a reit it will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on its income and property 

essex has established several taxable reit subsidiaries despite essex’s qualification as a reit its taxable reit subsidiaries must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income while essex will attempt to ensure that its dealings with its taxable reit subsidiaries will not adversely affect its reit qualification it cannot provide assurance that it will successfully achieve that result furthermore essex may be subject to a 100 penalty tax or its taxable reit subsidiaries may be denied deductions to the extent its dealings with its taxable reit subsidiaries are not deemed to be arm’s length in nature no assurances can be given that essex’s dealings with its taxable reit subsidiaries will be arm’s length in nature 

 

from time to time we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties under the internal revenue code any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a 100 penalty tax since we acquire properties for investment purposes we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions however whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction then essex would be required to pay a 100 penalty tax on any gain allocable to essex from the prohibited transaction and essex’s ability to retain future gains on real property sales may be jeopardized income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect essex’s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes therefore no assurances can be given that essex will be able to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit

 item 2 properties 

 

our core apartment portfolio as of december 31 2005 including partial ownership interests was comprised of 126 multifamily properties comprising 26587 apartment units of which 13382 units are located in southern california 6557 units are located in the san francisco bay area 5471 units are located in the seattle metropolitan area and 875 units are located in the portland metropolitan area the company’s multifamily properties accounted for 99 of the company’s property revenues for the year ended december 31 2005 

 

occupancy rates 

 

the 126 apartment communities had an average sameproperties occupancy as defined in item 7 based on “financial occupancy” during the year ended december 31 2005 of approximately 969 with respect to stabilized multifamily properties with sufficient operating history occupancy figures are based on financial occupancy the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue actual rental revenue represents contractual revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of financial occupancy 

 

as of december 31 2005 the headquarters building was 100 occupied by the company and the southern california office building was 99 occupied based on physical occupancy with respect to office buildings occupancy figures are based on “physical occupancy” which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied square footage by rentable square footage with respect to recreational vehicle parks manufactured housing communities or multifamily properties which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient operating history occupancy figures are based on “physical occupancy” which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied units by rentable units 

 

for the year ended december 31 2005 none of the company’s properties had book values equal to 10 or more of total assets of the company or gross revenues equal to 10 or more of aggregate gross revenues of the company

recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements the company has been sued for mold related matters and has settled some but not all of such matters insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates the company has however purchased pollution liability insurance which includes coverage for mold the company has adopted programs designed to manage the existence of mold in its properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property liabilities resulting from such mold related matters and the costs of carrying insurance to address potential mold related claims may also be substantial 

 

the company is subject to various other lawsuits in the normal course of its business operations accordingly such lawsuits as well as the class action lawsuit described above could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows

variable interest entities 

consolidated variable interest entities 

 

in accordance fin 46r the company consolidates emc efc 17 down reit limited partnerships comprising ten properties an office building that is subject to loans made by the company and the multifamily improvements owned by a third party in which the company owns the land underlying these improvements and from which the company receives fees including land lease subordination and property management fees and a joint venture to develop a building in los angeles california the company consolidated these entities because it is deemed the primary beneficiary under fin 46r the companys total assets and liabilities related to these variable interest entities vies net of intercompany eliminations were approximately 2309 million and 1467 million respectively at december 31 2005 and 2381 million and 1551 million respectively at december 31 2004 

 

interest holders in vies consolidated by the company are allocated net income equal to the cash payments made to those interest holders for services rendered or distributions from cash flow the remaining results of operations are generally allocated to the company 

 

properties consolidated in accordance with fin 46r were encumbered by third party nonrecourse loans totaling 1418 million and 1513 million as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively 

 

unconsolidated variable interest entities 

 

as of december 31 2005 the company is involved with four vies of which it is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary total assets and liabilities of these entities as of december 31 2005 were approximately 940 million and 737 million respectively the company does not have a significant exposure to loss resulting from its involvement with these unconsolidated vies 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we define critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require our management to exercise their most difficult subjective and complex judgments our critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas i consolidation under applicable accounting standards of various entities ii assessing the carrying values of our real estate properties and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates iii internal cost capitalization iv and qualification as a reit the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 

 

the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie if such an entity is a vie then the company analyzes the expected losses and expected residual returns to determine who is the primary beneficiary if the company is the primary beneficiary then the entity is consolidated the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 

 

rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation components on rental properties have been provided over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 30 years using the straightline method development costs include acquisition direct and indirect construction costs interest and real estate taxes incurred during the construction and property stabilizations periods maintenance and repair expenses that do not add to the value or prolong the useful life of the property are expensed as incurred asset replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

 

the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the property’s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges 

when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties an impairment charge or investment valuation charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value 

 

the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs including interest and real estate taxes incurred during development and redevelopment activities interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period included in capitalized costs are management’s estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development accounting legal fees and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under development

potential factors affecting future operating results 

 

many factors affect the company’s actual financial performance and may cause the company’s future results to be different from past performance or trends these factors include those set forth under the caption “risk factors” in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k and the following 

 

development and redevelopment activities 

 

the company pursues multifamily residential properties and development and redevelopment projects from time to time these projects generally require various government and other approvals the receipt of which cannot be assured the companys development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks including the following 

 

 

 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the companys stockholders further the development and redevelopment of properties is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments 

 

interest rate fluctuations 

 

the company monitors changes in interest rates and believes that it is well positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate risk perspective however current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase rapidly to levels more in line with higher historical levels the immediate effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher interest expense on the companys variable interest rate debt the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the companys ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and the companys ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 

 

funds from operations ffo 

 

ffo is a financial measure that is commonly used in the reit industry essex presents funds from operations as a supplemental performance measure ffo is not used by essex as nor should it be considered to be an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of essex’s operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of essex’s ability to fund its cash needs 

 

ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present nor does essex intend it to present a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance essex believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings further essex believes that its consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 

 

in calculating ffo essex follows the definition for this measure published by the national association of reits “nareit” which is a reit trade association essex believes that under the nareit ffo definition the two most significant adjustments made to net income are i the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and ii the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of previously depreciated properties essex agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons 

 

 

 

 

management has consistently applied the nareit definition of ffo to all periods presented however other reits in calculating ffo may vary from the nareit definition for this measure and thus their disclosure of ffo may not be comparable to essex’s calculation 

 

the following table sets forth the company’s calculation of ffo for 2005 and 2004 

 

 

 

the following table sets forth the company’s cash flows for 2005 and 2004 

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and longterm debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company’s real estate investment portfolio and operations the company’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 

 

the company’s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows management believes that the carrying amounts of its libor debt approximates fair value as of december 31 2005 because interest rates yields and other terms for these instruments are consistent with yields and other terms currently available to the company for similar instruments management has estimated that the fair value of the company’s 114 billion of fixed rate mortgage notes payable and exchangeable bonds at december 31 2005 is approximately 118 billion based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable compared to those available in the marketplace 

 

 

 

1 50000 covered by a forwardstarting swap at a fixed rate of 4927 with a settlement date on or before october 1 2007 

2 50000 covered by a forwardstarting swap at a fixed rate of 4869 with a settlement date on or before october 1 2008 also effective february 2006 25000 covered by a forwardstarting swap at a fixed rate of 5082 with a settlement date on or before january 1 2009 

3 effective february 2006 100000 covered by two forwardstarting swaps at a fixed rate of 5099 with a settlement date on or before january 1 2011 

4 152749 subject to interest rate caps 

 

the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december 31 2005 it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date as a result our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations would depend on the exposures that arise during the period our hedging strategies at the time and interest rates 

the company’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks to accomplish this objective the company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variablerate amounts in exchange for fixedrate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount

property type focus the company focuses on acquisition and development of multifamily residential communities containing between 75 and 750 units these types of properties offer attractive opportunities because such properties provide opportunities for value enhancement since many of these properties have been owned by parties that are either inadequately capitalized or lack the professional property management and redevelopment expertise of the company 

geographic focus the company focuses its property investments in markets that meet the following criteria 

major metropolitan areas the company focuses on metropolitan areas having a regional population in excess of one million people real estate markets in these areas are typically characterized by a greater number of buyers and sellers and are therefore more liquid liquidity is an important element for implementing the companys strategy of varying its portfolio in response to changing market conditions supply constraints the company believes that properties located in real estate markets with limited development opportunities are well suited to produce increased rental income when evaluating supply constraints the company reviews i availability of developable land sites on which competing properties could be readily constructed ii political barriers to growth resulting from a restrictive local political environment regarding development such an environment in addition to the restrictions on development itself is often associated with a lengthy development process and expensive development fees and iii physical barriers to growth resulting from natural limitations to development such as mountains or waterways rental demand created by high cost of housing  the company concentrates on markets in which the cost of renting compares favorably to the cost of owning a home in such markets rent levels tend to be higher and operating expenses and capital expenditures as a percentage of rent are lower in comparison with markets that have a lower cost of owning a home job proximity  the company believes that most renters select housing based on its proximity to their jobs and related commuting factors the company obtains local area information relating to its residential properties and uses this information when making multifamily property acquisition decisions the company also reviews the location of major employers relative to its portfolio and potential acquisition properties following the above criteria the company is currently pursuing investment opportunities in selected markets of northern and southern california and the pacific northwest

10 environmental matters 

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on in or migrating from such property such laws often impose liability without regard as to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners or operators ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility to which such substances or wastes were sent whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person in addition certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials acms into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with acms in connection with the ownership direct or indirect operation management and development of real properties the company could be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and costs related to injuries of persons and property 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as proposition 65 requiring that clear and reasonable warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke although we have sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 65 

methane gas is a naturallyoccurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas of california particularly in the southern california coastal areas methane is a nontoxic gas but can be ignitable in confined spaces when exposed to air although naturallyoccurring methane gas is not regulated at the state or federal level some local governments such as the county of los angeles have imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems in areas where methane gas is known to be located methane gas is also associated with certain industrial activities such as former municipal waste landfills 

recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties other than essex alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements essex has been sued for mold related matters and has settled or is in the process of settling such matters insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates we have adopted programs designed to manage the existence of mold in our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property 

all of the properties have been subjected to preliminary environmental assessments including a review of historical and public data phase i assessments by independent environmental consultants phase i assessments generally consist of an investigation of environmental conditions at the property including a preliminary investigation of the site an identification of publicly known conditions occurring at properties in the vicinity of the site an investigation as to the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs acms and aboveground and underground storage tanks presently or formerly at the sites and preparation and issuance of written reports as a result of information collected in the phase i assessments certain of the properties were subjected to additional environmental investigations including in a some cases soil sampling or ground water analysis to further evaluate the environmental conditions of those properties 

the environmental studies revealed the presence of soil and groundwater contamination and the presence of methane and associated gases at certain of the properties based on its current knowledge the company does not believe the future liabilities associated with the contamination or with the methane gas is material and is not in receipt of any cleanup order from a regulatory agency environmental studies also indicate that one of the properties is located on a former municipal landfill which has been closed for approximately eighty years to the companys knowledge the property has not been subject to any regulatory requirements since it was initially closed however state regulatory agencies have discretion to impose various requirements on closed landfills including monitoring for methane gas limited sampling has indicated there is no methane gas above explosive limits at the property based on its current knowledge the company does not believe that any regulatory requirements or other liabilities associated with this property are material the environmental studies have also indicated that several properties contain acm a common building material prior to the 1980s the acm is found primarily in the ceiling textures floor tiles and adhesives to the companys knowledge the acm is in good condition the company has implemented an operations and maintenance plan to inspect and monitor the acm to ensure that the acm remains in good condition and is properly managed based on the information contained in the environmental studies the company believes that the costs if any it might bear as a result of environmental contamination or other conditions at these properties would not have a material adverse affect on the companys financial condition result of operations or liquidity certain properties that have been sold by the company were identified as having potential groundwater contamination while the company does not anticipate any losses or costs related to groundwater contamination on properties that have been sold it is possible that such losses or costs may materialize in the future 

11 except with respect to three properties the company has no indemnification agreements from third parties for potential environmental cleanup costs at its properties the company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly owned by the company no assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of the properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to the company or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of the properties the company has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described above 

insurance

the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the properties there are however certain types of extraordinary losses for which the company does not have insurance substantially all of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity the company has obtained earthquake insurance for most the properties most of the properties are included in an earthquake insurance program that is subject to an aggregate limit of 400 million payable upon a covered loss in excess of a 75 million selfinsured retention amount and a 5 deductible in the future the company may selectively exclude properties from being covered by earthquake insurance based on managements evaluation of the following factors i the availability of coverage on terms acceptable to the company ii the location of the property and the amount of seismic activity affecting that region and iii the age of the property and building codes in effect at the time of construction despite earthquake coverage on most of the companys properties should a property sustain damage as a result of an earthquake the company may incur losses due to deductibles copayments and losses in excess of applicable insurance if any 

although the company carries certain insurance for nonearthquake damages to its properties and liability insurance the company may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage 

competition

the companys properties compete for tenants with similar properties primarily on the basis of location rent charged services provided and the design and condition of the improvements competition for tenants from competing properties affects the amount of rent charged as well as rental growth rates vacancy rates deposit amounts and the services and features provided at each property while economic conditions are generally stable in the companys target markets a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or liquidity 

the company also experiences competition when attempting to acquire properties that meet its investment criteria such competing buyers include domestic and foreign financial institutions other reits life insurance companies pension funds trust funds partnerships and individual investors 

working capital

the company expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements by using its working capital cash generated from operations and its amounts available on lines of credit the company believes that its future net cash flows and borrowing capacity will be adequate to meet operating requirements and to provide for payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit qualification requirements the company has line of credit facilities in the committed amount of approximately 2750 million at december 31 2003 the company had an outstanding balance of 931 million under these line of credit facilities 

12 risk factors

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to us these risks include among others the following 

debt financing

at december 31 2003 we had approximately 8322 million of indebtedness including 1684 million of variable rate indebtedness of which 753 million is subject to interest rate protection agreements 

we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the following 

cash flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest inability to refinance existing indebtedness on encumbered properties the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness inability to comply with debt covenants which could cause an acceleration of the maturity date and repaying debt before the scheduled maturity date could result in prepayment penalties uncertainty of ability to refinance balloon payments

at december 31 2003 we had an aggregate of approximately 8322 million of mortgage debt and line of credit borrowings some of which are subject to balloon payments of principal we do not expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations to make all of such balloon payments when due under these mortgages and the line of credit borrowings 

at december 31 2003 these mortgages and lines of credit borrowings had the following scheduled maturity dates 

2004207 million includes lines of credit balance of 125 million as of december 31 2003 

2005413 million 

2006207 million 

2007635 million 

20081089 million 

2009 and thereafter5771 million includes lines of credit balance of 806 million as of december 31 2003

we may not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness or lines of credit the properties subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the mortgagee this could cause us to lose income and asset value alternatively we may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates if we are unable to make such payments when due a mortgage lender could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

13 economic environment and impact on operating results

both the national economy and the economies of the western states in which we own manage and develop properties some of which are concentrated in hightech sectors have been and may continue to be in an economic downturn the impact of such downturn on our operating results can include and are not limited to reduction in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising turnover and repair and maintenance expense

our property type and diverse geographic locations provide some degree of risk moderation but we are not immune to a prolonged down cycle in the real estate markets in which we operate although we believe we are well positioned to meet the challenges ahead it is possible that reductions in occupancy and market rental rates will result in reduction of rental revenues operating income cash flows and the market value of our shares prolonged downturn could also affect our ability to obtain financing at acceptable rates of interest and to access funds from the disposition of properties at acceptable prices

risk of rising interest rates

at december 31 2003 we had approximately 753 million of longterm variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at a floating rate tied to the rate of shortterm taxexempt revenue bonds which matures at various dates from 2020 through 2032 and 931 million of variable rate indebtedness under our lines of credit of which 125 million bearing interest at 110 over libor and 806 million bearing interest at the freddie macs reference rate plus 055 to 060 the longterm variable rate indebtedness of approximately 753 million is subject to an interest rate protection agreement which may reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates the remaining 931 million of longterm variable rate indebtedness is not subject to any interest rate protection agreement and consequently an increase in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our net income and results of operations 

current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase rapidly to levels more in line with recent historic levels the immediate effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher interest expense on our variable rate indebtedness the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and our ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 

risk of inflation deflation 

substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses the company believes it effectively manages its property and other expenses but understands that substantial annual rates of inflation or deflation could adversely impact operating results

risk of losses on interest rate hedging arrangements

we have from time to time entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates and may continue to do so although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates these agreements also may reduce the benefits to us when interest rates decline we cannot assure you that we can refinance any such hedging arrangements or that we will be able to enter into other hedging arrangements to replace existing ones if interest rates decline furthermore interest rate movements during the term of interest rate hedging arrangements may result in a gain or loss on our investment in the hedging arrangement in addition if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged we may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk our policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with large financial institutions 

14 acquisition activities risks that acquisitions will fail to meet expectations

we intend to continue to acquire multifamily residential properties there are risks that acquired properties will fail to perform as expected estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements necessary to allow us to market an acquired property as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate in addition we expect to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by essex the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of essexs existing stockholders if we finance new acquisitions under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless we obtain substitute financing essex may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development or such lines of credit may be available only on disadvantageous terms 

also we may not be able to refinance our existing lines of credit upon maturity or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing indebtedness further acquisitions of properties are subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate investment risks 

on december 17 2002 we completed the acquisition of john m sachs inc a real estate company pursuant to which we acquired a real estate portfolio consisting primarily of apartment communities located in san diego county california the assets in this transaction were valued at approximately 301 million this is our largest real estate portfolio acquisition to date the integration of these properties into essex has placed a burden on our management team and infrastructure to date these properties have performed as expected in addition as this transaction was structured as a merger there is the risk that we assumed unknown liabilities which might adversely affect our results of operations 

risks that development activities will be delayed not completed andor fail to achieve expected results 

we pursue multifamily residential property development projects from time to time development projects generally require various governmental and other approvals which we cannot assure you that we will receive our development activities generally entail certain risks including the following 

funds may be expended and managements time devoted to projects that may not be completed construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates possibly making the project economically unfeasible development projects may be delayed due to among other things adverse weather conditions occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated and expenses at a completed development may be higher than anticipated these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to essexs stockholders further the development of properties is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate investment risks

the geographic concentration of the properties and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact our financial conditions and results of operations

we derived significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 from properties concentrated in southern california los angeles ventura orange and san diego counties northern california the san francisco bay area and the pacific northwest the seattle washington and portland oregon metropolitan areas as of december 31 2003 of our 121 ownership interests in multifamily residential properties 90 are located in california as a result of this geographic concentration if a local property market performs poorly the income from the properties in that market could decrease as a result of such a decrease in income we may be unable to pay expected dividends to our stockholders the performance of the economy in each of these areas affects occupancy market rental rates and expenses and consequently impacts the income generated from the properties and their underlying values the financial results of major local employers also may impact the cash flow and value of certain of the properties economic downturns in the local markets in which we own properties could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

15 competition in the multifamily residential market may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for our properties

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the multifamily properties in attracting residents these include other multifamily rental apartments and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the properties are located the properties also compete for residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale if the demand for our properties is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing properties on a more costeffective basis rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we also face competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of properties some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do this competition may result in increased costs of properties we acquire andor develop 

debt financing on properties may result in insufficient cash flow

where possible we intend to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on our investments and to provide for additional investments that we could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the properties will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code we may obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all of the properties these mortgages may be recourse nonrecourse or crosscollateralized as of december 31 2003 essex had 55 of its 91 consolidated properties encumbered by debt of the 55 properties 35 are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those properties and with respect to the remaining 20 properties 5 cross collateralized mortgages are secured by 8 properties 4 properties 3 properties 3 properties and 2 properties respectively the holders of this indebtedness will have a claim against these properties and to the extent indebtedness is crosscollateralized lenders may seek to foreclose upon properties which are not the primary collateral for their loan this in turn may accelerate other indebtedness secured by properties foreclosure of properties would reduce our income and asset value 

dividend requirements as a result of preferred stock may lead to a possible inability to sustain dividends

in 1998 and 1999 the operating partnership issued 210 million in aggregate of series b cumulative redeemable preferred units the series b preferred units series c cumulative redeemable preferred units the series c preferred units series d cumulative redeemable preferred units the series d preferred units and series e cumulative redeemable preferred units the series e preferred units in 2003 the company redeemed the series c preferred units and issued approximately 25 million of series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock series f preferred stock the series b preferred units the series d preferred units the series e preferred units and the series f preferred stock are collectively referred to as the preferred equity 

the terms of the series f preferred stock and of the preferred stock into which each series of preferred units are exchangeable provide for certain cumulative preferential cash distributions per each share of preferred stock these terms also provide that while such preferred stock is outstanding essex cannot authorize declare or pay any distributions on the common stock unless all distributions accumulated on all shares of such preferred stock have been paid in full the distributions payable on such preferred stock may impair essexs ability to pay dividends on its common stock 

if essex wishes to issue any common stock in the future including upon exercise of stock options the funds required to continue to pay cash dividends at current levels will be increased essexs ability to pay dividends will depend largely upon the performance of the properties and other properties that may be acquired in the future 

16 essexs ability to pay dividends on its stock is further limited by the maryland general corporation law under the maryland general corporation law essex may not make a distribution on stock if after giving effect to such distribution either 

we would not be able to pay its indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than its total liabilities if essex cannot pay dividends on its stock essexs status as a real estate investment trust may be jeopardized 

resale of shares pursuant to our effective registration statement may have an adverse effect on the market price of the shares 

pursuant to the acquisition of john m sachs inc a real estate company in december 2002 we issued 2719875 shares of common stock as partial consideration for the acquisition to the trusts that were the shareholders of that company in connection with the acquisition essex entered into a registration rights agreement with these trusts pursuant to which in january 2003 we filed a registration statement on form s3 in order to enable the resale of these shares of common stock in an amendment to this registration statement filed in april 2003 we also registered pursuant to certain registration rights 50000 shares of common stock which are issuable to the trusts in connection with certain contractual obligations and 2270490 shares of common stock which are issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership these limited partnership interests are held by senior members of our management certain members of our board of directors and certain outside investors or the operating partnership holders and comprise approximately 92 of the limited partnership interests of the operating partnership as of december 31 2003 in addition the operating partnership has invested in certain real estate partnerships in the 2003 registration statement we also registered pursuant to certain registration rights 1473125 shares of common stock which are issuable upon redemption of all of the limited partnership interests in such real estate partnerships in sum this 2003 registration statement covers in aggregate 6513490 shares of our common stock the resale of the shares of common stock pursuant to the registration statement may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares

our chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest

our chairman george m marcus is not an employee of essex mr marcus owns interests in various other real estaterelated businesses and investments he is the chairman of the marcus  millichap company or mm which is the holding company for real estate brokerage and services companies mm has an interest in pacific property company a company that invests in west coast multifamily residential properties in 1999 we sold an office building to mm which essex previously occupied 

mr marcus has agreed not to divulge any information that may be received by him in his capacity as chairman of essex to any of his affiliated companies and that he will absent himself from any and all discussions by the essex board of directors regarding any proposed acquisition andor development of a multifamily property where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of his affiliated companies notwithstanding this agreement mr marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with us in acquiring andor developing multifamily properties which competition may be detrimental to us in addition due to such potential competition for real estate investments mr marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with us which may be detrimental to the interests of essexs stockholders 

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock

as of december 31 2003 george m marcus the chairman of our board of directors wholly or partially owned 1746282 shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of all vested options this represents approximately 77 of the outstanding shares of common stock mr marcus currently does not have majority control over us however he currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all our stockholders 

17 under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for any amendment of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with us our directors and executive officers including mr marcus and mr william a millichap a director of essex have substantial influence on us consequently their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders 

further pursuant to our acquisition of john m sachs inc in december 2002 we issued as partial consideration for the acquisition 2719875 shares of our common stock and an additional 35860 shares of common stock in july 2003 to the trusts that were the shareholders of that company as a result of this issuance these trusts own as of december 31 2003 in aggregate approximately 8 of our outstanding common stock pursuant to their ownership interest in essex these trusts may have significant influence over us such influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interest of all our stockholders

the voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock 

in general the holders of series f preferred stock and of the preferred stock into which our preferred units are exchangeable do not have any voting rights however if full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock for six quarterly distributions periods the holders of preferred stock who have not received distributions voting together as a single class will have the right to elect two additional directors to serve on essexs board of directors these voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have been paid in full at that time the holders of the preferred stock are divested of these voting rights and the term and office of the directors so elected immediately terminates 

in addition while any shares of series f preferred stock or shares of preferred stock into which the preferred units are exchangeable are outstanding essex may not without the consent of the holders of twothirds of the outstanding shares of each series of preferred stock each voting separately as a single class 

authorize or create any class of series of stock that ranks senior to such preferred stock with respect to the payment of dividends rights upon liquidation dissolution or windingup of our business amend alter or repeal the provisions of essexs charter or bylaws that would materially and adversely affect the rights of such preferred stock or in the case of the preferred stock into which our preferred units are exchangeable merge or consolidate with another entity or transfer substantially all of its assets to another entity except if such preferred stock remains outstanding with the surviving entity and has the same terms and except in certain other circumstances these voting rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of essexs common stock 

the redemption rights of the series b preferred units series d preferred units and series f preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of common stock

upon the occurrence of one of the following events the terms of the operating partnerships series b and d preferred units require it to redeem all of such units and the terms of the companys series f preferred stock provide the holders of the majority of the outstanding series f preferred stock the right to require the company to redeem all of such stock

the company completes a going private transaction and its common stock is no longer registered under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended 18 the company completes a consolidation or merger or sale of substantially all of its assets and the surviving entitys debt securities do not possess an investment grade rating or the company fails to qualify as a reit the aggregate redemption price of the series b preferred units would be 80 million the aggregate redemption price of the series d preferred units would be 50 million and the aggregate redemption price of the series f preferred stock would be 25 million plus in each case any accumulated distributions

these redemption rights may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of holders of common stock further these redemption rights might trigger in situations where the company needs to conserve its cash reserves in which event such redemption might adversely affect the company and its common holders

maryland business combination law may not allow certain transactions between us and affiliates to proceed without compliance with such law 

the maryland general corporation law establishes special requirements for business combinations between a maryland corporation and interested stockholders unless exemptions are applicable an interested stockholder is any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock 

the law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions this means that the transaction must be approved by at least 

80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares and 66 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom the business combination is to be effected however as permitted by the statute the board of directors of essex irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by us george m marcus william a millichap who are the chairman and a director of essex respectively and mm or any entity owned or controlled by messrs marcus and millichap and mm consequently the supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to any business combination between us and mr marcus mr millichap or mm as a result we may in the future enter into business combinations with messrs marcus and millichap and mm without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland general corporation law 

antitakeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement charter bylaws and certain provisions of maryland law could delay defer or prevent a change in control 

while essex is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating partnerships partnership agreement place limitations on essexs ability to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of essexs stockholders the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership essex cannot without first obtaining the consent of a majorityininterest of the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of our general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity such limitations on essexs ability to act may result in our being precluded from taking action that the board of directors believes is in the best interests of essexs stockholders in addition as of december 31 2003 one individual george m marcus held or controlled more than 50 of the outstanding units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership allowing such actions to be blocked by a small number of limited partners 

19 essexs charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other terms of such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock we may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control such a transaction might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock also such a class of preferred stock could have dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders of common stock 

essexs charter as well as essexs stockholder rights plan also contains other provisions that may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of essexs stockholders essexs stockholder rights plan is designed among other things to prevent a person or group from gaining control of us without offering a fair price to all of essexs stockholders also the bylaws may be amended by the board of directors to include provisions that would have a similar effect although essex presently has no such intention the charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

in addition the maryland general corporations law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed to be control shares under the maryland general corporations law control shares are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt essex from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of essexs stockholders 

bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain properties

at december 31 2003 we had approximately 753 million of variable rate taxexempt financing relating to the inglenook court apartments wandering creek apartments treetops apartments huntington breakers apartments camarillo oaks apartments and parker ranch apartments and 159 million of fixed rate tax exempt financing related to meadowood apartments this taxexempt financing subjects these properties to certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants we expect to engage in taxexempt financings in the future in addition the internal revenue code and rules and regulations thereunder impose various restrictions conditions and requirements excluding interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue code also requires that at least 20 of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed 50 of the median income for the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development department of the federal government in addition to federal requirements certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed properties if we are required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test if essex does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements the tax exempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and we may be subject to additional contractual liability 

adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate investment risks

real property investments are subject to a variety of risks the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred if the properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected the performance of the economy in each of the areas in which the properties are located affects occupancy market rental rates and expenses 

20 consequently the income from the properties and their underlying values may be impacted the financial results of major local employers may have an impact on the cash flow and value of certain of the properties as well 

income from the properties may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

the general economic climate local economic conditions in which the properties are located such as oversupply of housing or a reduction in demand for rental housing the attractiveness of the properties to tenants competition from other available space essexs ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance and increased operating expenses also as leases on the properties expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to us income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws eg the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and tax laws interest rate levels and the availability and terms of financing in addition real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited 

essexs joint ventures and joint ownership of properties and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit essexs ability to control such properties and partial interests

instead of purchasing properties directly we have invested and may continue to invest as a coventurer joint venturers often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that the coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or our policies or objectives consequently a coventurers actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although we seek to maintain sufficient influence of any joint venture to achieve its objectives we may be unable to take action without our joint venture partners approval or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without consent additionally should a joint venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for such partners share of joint venture liabilities 

from time to time we through the operating partnership invest in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing or managing real property in certain circumstances the operating partnerships interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnerships ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnerships objectives in addition the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity in addition we have and in the future may enter into transactions that could require us to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets into joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within our control occur although we plan to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on their sale pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the internal revenue code we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on our financial position 

dedicated investment activities and other factors specifically related to essex apartment value fund lp

in 2001 we organized an investment fund essex apartment value fund lp or fund i which will be subject to specific exceptions our exclusive investment vehicle for new investment until at least 90 of fund is committed capital has been invested or committed for investments or if earlier december 31 2003 currently fund i is considered fully invested based on its acquisitions to date and anticipated development and redevelopment expenditures we are committed to invest 214 of the aggregate capital committed to fund i the company is in the process of forming a second essex apartment value fund fund ii which is expected to be similar to fund i in size and structure essex anticipates an initial closing of fund ii during the second quarter of 2004 which would result in a final 50 million capital commitment by a subsidiary of the company these funds involves risks to us such as the following our partners in the funds might become bankrupt in which event we might become generally liable for the liabilities of fund i andor fund ii have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals fail to fund capital commitments as contractually required or fail to approve decisions regarding the funds that are in our best interest we will however generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over the funds to permit it to achieve its business objectives 

21 investments in mortgages and other real estate securities

we may invest in securities related to real estate which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders we may purchase securities issued by entities which own real estate and may also invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations these mortgages may be first second or third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed in general investments in mortgages include the following risks 

that the value of mortgaged property may be less than the amounts owed causing realized or unrealized losses the borrower may not pay indebtedness under the mortgage when due requiring us to foreclose and the amount recovered in connection with the foreclosure may be less than the amount owed that interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than our cost of funds and in the case of junior mortgages that foreclosure of a senior mortgage would eliminate the junior mortgage if any of the above were to occur cash flows from operations and our ability to make expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected 

possible environmental liabilities

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property we carry certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk we have conducted environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater contamination at certain properties such contamination at certain of these properties was reported to have migrated onsite from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations the former industrial users of the properties were identified as the source of contamination the environmental studies noted that certain properties are located adjacent to any possible down gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination the lateral limits of which may extend onto such properties the environmental studies also noted that at certain of these properties contamination existed because of the presence of underground fuel storage tanks which have been removed in general in connection with the ownership operation financing management and development of real properties we may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities we may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to persons and property 

recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties other than essex alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements essex has been sued for mold related matters and has settled or is in the process of settling such matters insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates we have adopted programs designed to manage the existence of mold in our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as proposition 65 requiring that clear and reasonable warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke although we have sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 65 

except with respect to three properties the company has no indemnification agreements from third parties for potential environmental cleanup costs at its properties the company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly owned by the company no assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of the properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to the company or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of the properties the company has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described above 

22 general uninsured losses

we carry comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the properties there are however certain types of extraordinary losses for which we may not have sufficient insurance certain of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity we have obtained certain limited earthquake insurance coverage we may sustain losses due to insurance deductibles copayments on insured losses or uninsured losses or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

changes in real estate tax and other laws

generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders in addition recent changes to the us federal income tax law may adversely affect us and other reits by reducing the demand for reit stocks generally

changes in financing policy no limitation on debt

we have adopted a policy of maintaining a debttototalmarket capitalization ratio of less than 50 the calculation of debttototalmarket capitalization is as follows total property indebtedness divided by the sum of total property indebtedness plus total equity market capitalization

as used in the above formula total equity market capitalization is equal to the aggregate market value of the outstanding shares of common stock based on the greater of current market price or the gross proceeds per share from public offerings of the outstanding shares plus any undistributed net cash flow assuming the conversion of all limited partnership interests in the operating partnership into shares of common stock and the gross proceeds of the preferred units of the operating partnership based on this calculation including the current market price and excluding undistributed net cash flow our debtto totalmarketcapitalization ratio was approximately 312 as of december 31 2003 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly the board of directors of essex could change current policies and the policies of the operating partnership regarding indebtedness if we changed these policies we could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and the obligations of the operating partnership and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations such increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the properties 

23 failure to qualify as a reit

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code however we cannot assure you that we have qualified as a reit or that we will continue to so qualify in the future to qualify as a reit we must satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions only limited judicial or administrative interpretation exists for these provisions and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may apply to us potentially with retroactive effect and adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit we may receive significant nonqualifying income or acquire nonqualifying assets which as a result may cause us to approach the income and assets test limits imposed by the internal revenue code there is a risk that we may not satisfy these tests if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates we also may be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify this would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property

24 occupancy rates

the 121 multifamily residential properties had an average occupancy based on financial occupancy during the year ended december 31 2003 of approximately 96 with respect to stabilized multifamily properties with sufficient operating history occupancy figures are based on financial occupancy which is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue actual rental revenue represents contractual revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of financial occupancy 

as of december 31 2003 the headquarters building was 100 occupied by the company and the southern california office building was 92 occupied based on physical occupancy with respect to office buildings occupancy figures are based on physical occupancy which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied square footage by rentable square footage with respect to recreational vehicle parks manufactured housing communities or multifamily properties which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient operating history occupancy figures are based on physical occupancy which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied units by rentable units

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion is based on the consolidated financial statements of essex property trust inc essex or the company as of and for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 this information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

overview

the company believes that its operating results have largely been a result of its business strategy of investing in submarkets that provide the greatest potential for rental growth at the lowest relative risk essex believes that its market research process which includes an analysis of both metropolitan statistical areas msas and submarkets provides it with a distinct competitive advantage essex researches market data by reviewing data from private and government sources as well as information developed or verified by its field personnel essex then utilizes its proprietary research model to project market rent trends allowing the company to allocate capital to the markets with the best riskadjusted return potential

essexs research process begins with a macroeconomic analysis of various msas followed by an evaluation of the submarkets within that msa the objective of the economic research department is to estimate the amount of new demand for housing comparing it to the number of single family and multifamily homes being constructed within a submarket historically markets with demand for multifamily housing that is greater than supply generate increasing occupancy levels and growth in rents

key components of essexs analysis are as follows

job growth the company believes that quality job growth will lead to demand for multifamily and forsale housing based on a variety of considerations the company estimates how the total demand for housing will be allocated between rental and forsale housing

housing supply limited housing supply both rental and forsale is a very important factor in maintaining high occupancy levels particularly in periods of recession or slow economic growth the company seeks to identify markets in which there is a low level of housing construction measured as a percentage of existing housing stock

cost of forsale housing the company prefers areas with relatively expensive forsale housing which is usually caused by an insufficient amount of singlefamily housing construction the company seeks to identify areas where the cost of rent is low relative to both median income levels and the cost of homeownership 

demographic trends the company evaluates areas with longterm positive immigration and demographic trends and areas that provide an attractive quality of life

based on its evaluation of multifamily housing supply and demand factors the company forecasts the occupancy and rent trends for its targeted submarkets and actively seeks to expand its multifamily portfolio in the submarket with the greatest riskadjusted return 

37 by region the companys operating and investment strategy are as follow

southern california region at the time of the companys 1994 initial public offering ipo the company had ownership interests representing 17 of its multifamily units in this region following the ipo the company using its research process determined that various markets in the southern california region were attractive for multifamily property investment and the company accordingly increased ownership in such markets as of december 31 2003 we have ownership interests representing 58 of our multifamily units in this region during 2003 the region continued to perform well with same store property revenues increasing 48 versus 2002 the company expects this region to continue generating positive operating results in the near term

38 critical accounting policies and estimates

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities our critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties its investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates its notes receivables and qualification as a reit the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management

rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation on rental properties has been provided over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 30 years using the straightline method development costs include acquisition direct and indirect construction costs interest and real estate taxes incurred during the construction and property stabilizations periods maintenance and repair expenses that do not add to the value or prolong the useful life of the property are expensed as incurred asset replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the propertys expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 

with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties an impairment charge or investment valuation charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value 

the company assesses the carrying value of its notes receivables pursuant to fasbs sfas no114 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan pursuant to sfas no 114 a note is impaired if it is probable that the company will not collect all principal and interest contractually due the impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the notes effective interest rate the company does not accrue interest when a note is considered impaired when ultimate collectibility of the principal balance of the impaired note is in doubt all cash receipts on impaired notes are applied to reduce the principal amount of such notes until the principal has been recovered and are recognized as interest income thereafter

the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions

many factors affect the companys actual financial performance and may cause the companys future results to be different from past performance or trends these factors include those set forth under the caption risk factors in item i of this annual report on form 10k and the following 

economic environment

both the national economy and the economies of the western states in which the company owns manages and develops properties have been and continue to be in an economic downturn this has resulted in increased concessions and reductions in market rental rates 

the companys property type and diverse geographic locations provide some degree of risk moderation but are not immune to a prolonged downturn in the real estate markets in which the company operates although the company believes it is well positioned to meet the challenges ahead it is possible that further reductions in market rental rates will result in reduction of rental revenues operating income cash flows and the market value of the companys shares a prolonged recession could also affect the companys ability to obtain financing at acceptable rates of interest and to access funds from the disposition of properties at acceptable disposition prices 

interest rate fluctuations

the company monitors changes in interest rates and believes that it is well positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate risk perspective however current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase rapidly to levels more in line with historic levels the immediate effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher interest expense on the companys variable interest rate debt see item 7a and notes 7 and 8 to consolidated financial statements the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the companys ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and the companys ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 

inflation

inflationary increases would likely have a negative effect on property operating expenses and such increases may be at a greater rate than growth in property rental rates the company believes it effectively manages its property and other expenses but realizes that higher annual rates of inflation could result in increases to operating expense 

48 failure to qualify as a reit

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code however we cannot assure you that we have qualified as a reit or that we will continue to so qualify in the future if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates we may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify this would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property

funds from operations

funds from operations as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit is generally considered by industry analysts as an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit generally funds from operations adjusts the net income of equity reits for non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization of rental properties gains losses on sales of real estate and extraordinary items management considers funds from operations to be a useful financial performance measurement of an equity reit because together with net income cash flows and the interest coverage ratio funds from operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the performance of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures funds from operations does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and is not intended to indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the reits operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity funds from operations does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs including principal amortization capital improvements and distributions to shareholders funds from operations also does not represent cash flows generated from operating investing or financing activities as defined under gaap further funds from operations as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the companys calculation of funds from operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and longterm debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the companys real estate investment portfolio and operations the companys interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 

the companys interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows management believes that the carrying amounts of its libor debt approximates fair value as of december 31 2003 because interest rates yields and other terms for these instruments are consistent with yields and other terms currently available to the company for similar instruments management has estimated that the fair value of the companys 663833000 of fixed rate mortgage notes payable at december 31 2003 is approximately 632111000 based on terms of existing mortgage notes payable compared to those available in the marketplace

environmental matters

under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on in or migrating from such property such laws often impose liability without regard as to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the presence of such substances or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners or operators ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility to which such substances or wastes were sent whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person in addition certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials acms into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with acms in connection with the ownership direct or indirect operation management and development of real properties the company could be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines and costs related to injuries of persons and property 

recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties other than essex alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements although essex has not been sued for mold related matters it has received claim letters for such matters insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates we have adopted programs designed to manage the existence of mold in our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property 

10 all of the properties have been subjected to preliminary environmental assessments including a review of historical and public data phase i assessments by independent environmental consultants phase i assessments generally consist of an investigation of environmental conditions at the property including a preliminary investigation of the site an identification of publicly known conditions occurring at properties in the vicinity of the site an investigation as to the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs acms and aboveground and underground storage tanks presently or formerly at the sites and preparation and issuance of written reports as a result of information collected in the phase i assessments certain of the properties were subjected to additional environmental investigations including in a few cases soil sampling or ground water analysis to further evaluate the environmental conditions of those properties 

the environmental studies revealed the presence of groundwater contamination on certain of the properties certain of these properties had contamination which was reported to have migrated onsite from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations and one property was previously occupied by an industrial user that was identified as the source of contamination the environmental studies noted that certain of the properties are located adjacent to and possibly downgradient from sites with known groundwater contamination the lateral limits of which may extend onto such properties the environmental studies also noted that contamination existed at certain properties because of the former presence of underground fuel storage tanks that have been removed there are asbestoscontaining material in a number of the properties primarily in the form of ceiling texture floor tiles and adhesives which are generally in good condition at properties where radon hydrogen sulfide or methane has been identified as a potential concern the company has implemented remediating measures andor additional testing based on its current knowledge the company does not believe that future liabilities associated with asbestos radon hydrogen sulfide or methane will be material based on the information contained in the environmental studies the company believes that the costs if any it might bear as a result of environmental contamination or other conditions at these properties would not have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition result of operations or liquidity 

certain properties that have been sold by the company were identified as having potential groundwater contamination while the company does not anticipate any losses or costs related to groundwater contamination on properties that have been sold it is possible that such losses or costs may materialize in the future 

except with respect to three properties the company has no indemnification agreements from third parties for potential environmental cleanup costs at its properties the company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly owned by the company no assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of the properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to the company or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of the properties the company has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described above 

insurance

the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the properties there are however certain types of extraordinary losses for which the company does not have insurance substantially all of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity the company has obtained earthquake insurance for all the properties most of the properties are included in an earthquake insurance program that is subject to an aggregate limit of 400 million payable upon a covered loss in excess of a 75 million selfinsured retention amount and a 5 deductible in the future the company may selectively exclude properties from being covered by earthquake insurance based on managements evaluation of the following factors i the availability of coverage on terms acceptable to the company ii the location of the property and the amount of seismic activity affecting that region and iii the age of the property and building codes in effect at the time of construction despite earthquake coverage on most of the companys properties should a property sustain damage as a result of an earthquake the company may incur losses due to deductibles copayments and losses in excess of applicable insurance if any 

although the company carries certain insurance for nonearthquake damages to its properties and liability insurance the company may still incur losses due to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage 

11 competition

the companys properties compete for tenants with similar properties primarily on the basis of location rent charged services provided and the design and condition of the improvements competition for tenants from competing properties affects the amount of rent charged as well as rental growth rates vacancy rates deposit amounts and the services and features provided at each property while economic conditions are generally stable in the companys target markets a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of operations or liquidity 

the company also experiences competition when attempting to acquire properties that meet its investment criteria such competing buyers include domestic and foreign financial institutions other reits life insurance companies pension funds trust funds partnerships and individual investors 

working capital

the company expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements by using its working capital cash generated from operations and its amounts available on its lines of credit the company believes that its future net cash flows will be adequate to meet operating requirements and to provide for payment of dividends by the company in accordance with reit qualification requirements the company has credit facilities in the committed amount of approximately 195000000 at december 31 2002 the company had an outstanding balance of 126500000 under these facilities 

risk factors

our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to us these risks include among others the following 

debt financing

at december 31 2002 we had approximately 804063000 of indebtedness including 185920000 of variable rate indebtedness of which 59420000 is capped at interest rates ranging from 71 to 73 

we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including the following 

cash flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest 

inability to refinance existing indebtedness on encumbered properties and 

the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 

uncertainty of ability to refinance balloon payments

at december 31 2002 we had an aggregate of approximately 804063000 of mortgage debt and line of credit borrowings some of which are subject to balloon payments of principal we do not expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations to make all of such balloon payments when due under these mortgages and the line of credit borrowings 

at december 31 2002 these mortgages and lines of credit borrowings had the following scheduled maturity dates 

2003556 million includes lines of credit balance of 30 million as of december 31 2002 

20041046 million includes lines of credit balance of 965 million as of december 31 2002 

2005411 million 

2006205 million 

2007632 million 

2008 and thereafter5191 million 

12 we may not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness or lines of credit the properties subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the mortgagee this could mean a loss to us of income and asset value alternatively we may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates if we are unable to make such payments when due a mortgage lender could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

economic environment and impact on operating results

both the national economy and the economies of the western states in which we own manage and develop properties some of which are concentrated in hightech sectors have been and continue to be in a recession the impact of such recession on operating results can include and are not limited to reduction in rental rates occupancy levels property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising turnover and repair and maintenance expense

our property type and diverse geographic locations provide some degree of risk moderation but we are not immune to a prolonged down cycle in the real estate markets in which we operate although we believe we are well positioned to meet the challenges ahead it is possible that further reductions in occupancy and market rental rates will result in reduction of rental revenues operating income cash flows and the market value of our shares prolonged recession could also affect our ability to obtain financing at acceptable rates on interest and to access funds from the disposition of properties at acceptable prices

risk of rising interest rates

at december 31 2002 we had approximately 59420000 of longterm variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at a floating rate tied to the rate of shortterm taxexempt revenue bonds which matures at various dates from 2020 through 2026 and 126500000 of variable rate indebtedness under our lines of credit bearing interest at 110 over libor the longterm variable rate indebtedness of approximately 59420000 is subject to an interest rate protection agreement which may reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates the remaining 126500000 of longterm variable rate indebtedness is not subject to any interest rate protection agreement and consequently an increase in interest rates may have an adverse effect on net income and results of operations of essex 

current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase rapidly to levels more in line with recent historic levels the immediate effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher interest expense in our variable rate indebtedness the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and our ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 

risk of losses on interest rate hedging arrangements

we have from time to time entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates and may continue to do so although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates these agreements also may reduce the benefits to us when interest rates decline there can be no assurance that any such hedging arrangements can be refinanced or that we will be able to enter into other hedging arrangements to replace existing ones if interest rates decline furthermore interest rate movements during the term of interest rate hedging arrangements may result in a gain or loss on our investment in the hedging arrangement in addition if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged we may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk our policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with large financial institutions 

13 acquisition activities risks that acquisitions will fail to meet expectations

we intend to continue to acquire multifamily residential properties there are risks that acquired properties will fail to perform as expected estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements necessary to allow us to market an acquired property as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate in addition we expect to finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or additional equity by us the use of equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of our existing stockholders if new acquisitions are financed under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless substitute financing is obtained further availability under the lines of credit for new development may not be available or may be available only on disadvantageous terms 

also we may not be able to refinance its existing lines of credit upon maturity or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of the existing indebtedness further acquisitions of properties are subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks pleas see adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate investment risks 

on december 17 2002 we completed the acquisition of john m sachs inc a real estate company pursuant to which we acquired a real estate portfolio consisting primarily of apartment communities located in san diego county california the assets in this transaction were valued at approximately 301 million this is our largest real estate portfolio acquisition to date the integration of these properties into our company will place a burden on our management team and infrastructure these properties may not perform as expected in addition as this transaction was structured as a merger there is the risk that we assumed unknown liabilities which might adversely affect our results of operations 

risks that development activities will be delayed not completed andor fail to achieve expected results 

we pursue multifamily residential property development projects from time to time development projects generally require various governmental and other approvals the receipt of which cannot be assured our development activities generally entail certain risks including the following 

funds may be expended and managements time devoted to projects that may not be completed 

construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates possibly making the project economically unfeasible 

development projects may be delayed due to among other things adverse weather conditions 

occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated and 

expenses at a completed development may be higher than anticipated 

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders further the development of properties is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments for further information regarding these risks please see adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate investment risks

14 the geographic concentration of the properties and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact

significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 were derived from properties concentrated in northern california the san francisco bay area southern california los angeles ventura orange and san diego counties and the pacific northwest the seattle washington and portland oregon metropolitan areas as of december 31 2002 of our 112 ownership interests in multifamily residential properties 83 are located in california as a result of this geographic concentration if a local property market performs poorly the income from the properties in that market could decrease as a result of such a decrease in income we may be unable to pay expected dividends to our stockholders the performance of the economy in each of these areas affects occupancy market rental rates and expenses and consequently impacts the income generated from the properties and their underlying values the financial results of major local employers may also impact the cash flow and value of certain of the properties economic downturns in the local markets in which we own properties could have a negative impact on the financial condition and results from operations 

competition in the multifamily residential market may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for our properties

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the multifamily properties in attracting residents these include other multifamily rental apartments and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the properties are located the properties also compete for residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale if the demand for our properties is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire competing properties on a more costeffective basis rental rates may drop which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we also face competition from other real estate investment trusts businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of properties some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do this competition may result in increased costs of properties we acquire andor develop 

debt financing on properties may result in insufficient cash flow

where possible we intend to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on our investments and to provide for additional investments that we could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from the properties will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code we may obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all of the properties these mortgages may be recourse nonrecourse or cross collateralized as of december 31 2002 the company had 54 properties encumbered by debt of the 54 properties 35 are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those properties and with respect to the remaining 19 properties five crosscollateralized mortgages are secured by eight properties three properties three properties three properties and two properties respectively the holders of this indebtedness will have a claim against these properties and to the extent indebtedness is crosscollateralized lenders may seek to foreclose upon properties which are not the primary collateral for their loan this may in turn accelerate other indebtedness secured by properties foreclosure of properties would reduce our income and asset value 

dividend requirements as a result of preferred stock may lead to a possible inability to sustain dividends

in 1998 and 1999 the operating partnership issued 210 million in aggregate of series b cumulative redeemable preferred units the series b preferred units series c cumulative redeemable preferred units the series c preferred units series d cumulative redeemable preferred units the series d preferred units and series e cumulative redeemable preferred units the series e preferred units the series b preferred units the series c preferred units the series d preferred units and the series e preferred units are collectively referred to as the preferred units 

15 the terms of the preferred stock into which each series of preferred units are exchangeable provide for certain cumulative preferential cash distributions per each share of preferred stock these terms also provide that while such preferred stock is outstanding no distributions may be authorized declared or paid on the common stock unless all distributions accumulated on all shares of such preferred stock have been paid in full the distributions payable on such preferred stock may impair our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 

if we wish to issue any common stock in the future including upon exercise of stock options the funds required to continue to pay cash dividends at current levels will be increased our ability to pay dividends will depend largely upon the performance of the properties and other properties that may be acquired in the future 

our ability to pay dividends on our stock is further limited by the maryland general corporation law under the maryland general corporation law we may not make a distribution on stock if after giving effect to such distribution either 

we would not be able to pay its indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business or 

our total assets would be less than its total liabilities 

if we cannot pay dividends on our stock our status as a real estate investment trust may be jeopardized 

registration and resale of shares pursuant to our pending registration statement may have an adverse effect on the market price of the shares

pursuant to the acquisition of john m sachs inc a real estate company in december 2002 we issued 2719875 shares of common stock as partial consideration for the acquisition to the trusts that were the shareholders of that company in connection with the acquisition the company entered into a registration rights agreement with these trusts pursuant to which in january 2003 we filed a registration statement in order to enable their resale of these shares of common stock in this registration statement we are also registering pursuant to certain registration rights shares of common stock which are issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership these limited partnership interests are held by senior members of our management certain members of our board of directors and certain outside investors or the operating partnership holders and comprise approximately 10 of the limited partnership interests of the operating partnership as of december 31 2002 in addition the operating partnership has invested in certain real estate partnerships in this registration statement we are also registering pursuant to certain registration rights shares of common stock which are issuable upon redemption of all of the limited partnership interests on such real estate partnerships the registration and resale of the shares of common stock pursuant to the registration statement may have an adverse effect of the market price of our shares

our chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments which may lead to conflicts of interest

our chairman george m marcus owns interests in various other real estaterelated business and investments he is the chairman of the marcus  millichap company or mm which is the holding company for real estate brokerage and services companies mm has an interest in pacific property company a company that invests in west coast multifamily residential properties in 1999 we sold an office building which essex previously occupied to mm 

16 mr marcus has agreed not to divulge any information that may be received by him in this capacity as chairman of essex to any of affiliated companies and that he will absent himself from any and all discussions by the essex board of directors regarding any proposed acquisition andor development of a multifamily property where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of his affiliated companies notwithstanding this agreement mr marcus and affiliated entities may potentially compete with the company in acquiring andor developing multifamily properties which competition may be detrimental to the company in addition due to such potential competition for real estate investments mr marcus and affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with the company which may be detrimental to the interests of the companys shareholders 

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock

as of december 31 2002 george m marcus the chairman of our board of directors wholly or partially owned 1742349 shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of all vested options this represents approximately 75 of the outstanding shares of common stock mr marcus currently does not have majority control over us however he currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all our stockholders 

under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for any amendment of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with us our directors and executive officers including messrs marcus and millichap have substantial influence on us consequently their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders 

pursuant to our acquisition of john m sachs inc in december 2002 we issued as partial consideration for the acquisition 2719875 shares of our common stock to the trusts that were the shareholders of that company as a result of this issuance these trusts own as of december 31 2002 in aggregate approximately 13 of our outstanding common stock the trusts have common trustees and pursuant to their ownership interest in the company these trusts may have influence over us such influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interest of all our stockholders

the voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock 

in general the holders of the preferred stock into which our preferred units are exchangeable do not have any voting rights however if full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock for six quarterly distributions periods the holders of preferred stock who have not received distributions voting together as a single class will have the right to elect two additional directors to serve on our board of directors these voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have been paid in full at that time the holders of the preferred stock are divested of these voting rights and the term and office of the directors so elected immediately terminates 

in addition while any shares of preferred stock into which the preferred units are exchangeable are outstanding we 

may not authorize or create any class of series of stock that ranks senior to this preferred stock with respect to the payment of dividends rights upon liquidation dissolution or windingup of our business amend alter or repeal the provisions of our charter or bylaws that would materially and adversely affect these rights without the consent of the holders of twothirds of the outstanding shares of each series of preferred stock as applicable each voting separately as a single class merge or consolidate with another entity or transfer substantially all of its assets to any corporation or other entity without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least twothirds of each series of preferred stock each voting separately as a class unless the transaction meets certain criteria these voting rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of our common stock 

17 exemption of george m marcus from the maryland business combination law may allow certain transactions between us and george m marcus to proceed without compliance with such law 

the maryland general corporation law establishes special requirements for business combinations between a maryland corporation and interested stockholders unless exemptions are applicable an interested stockholder is any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock 

the law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions this means that the transaction must be approved by at least 

80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares and 

66 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom the business combination is to be effected 

however as permitted by the statute the board of directors irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by us george m marcus william a millichap who are the chairman and a director of essex respectively and mm or any entity owned or controlled by messrs marcus and millichap and mm consequently the supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to any business combination between us and mr marcus mr millichap or mm as a result we may in the future enter into business combinations with messrs marcus and millichap and mm without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland general corporation law 

antitakeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement charter bylaws and certain provisions of maryland law could delay defer or prevent a change in control 

while we are the sole general partner of the operating partnership and generally have full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating partnerships partnership agreement place limitations on our ability to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of our stockholders the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership we cannot without first obtaining the consent of a majorityininterest of the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of our general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity such limitations on our ability to act may result in our being precluded from taking action that the board of directors believes is in the best interests of our stockholders in addition as of december 31 2002 two individuals together held more than 50 of the outstanding units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership allowing such actions to be blocked by a small number of limited partners 

our charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other terms of such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock although we have no intention to issue any additional shares of preferred stock at the present time we may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control such a transaction might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock also such a class of preferred stock could have dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders of common stock 

our charter as well as its stockholder rights plan also contains other provisions that may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of our stockholders our stockholder rights plan is designed among other things to prevent a person or group from gaining control of us without offering a fair price to all of our stockholders also the bylaws may be amended by the board of directors to include provisions that would have a similar effect although we presently have no such intention the charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control for example subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 percent in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 

18 in addition the maryland general corporations law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed to be control shares under the maryland general corporations law control shares are those which when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges although the bylaws exempt us from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law the provisions of the bylaws may be amended or eliminated by the board of directors at any time in the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law could delay defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain properties

at december 31 2002 we had approximately 594 million of variable rate taxexempt financing relating to the inglenook court apartments wandering creek apartments treetops apartments huntington breakers apartments camarillo oaks apartments and parker ranch apartments and 162 million of fixed rate tax exempt financing related to meadowood apartments this taxexempt financing subjects these properties to certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants we expect to engage in taxexempt financings in the future in addition the internal revenue code and rules and regulations thereunder impose various restrictions conditions and requirements excluding interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue code also requires that at least 20 of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed 50 of the median income for the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development department of the federal government in addition to federal requirements certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed properties if we are required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test if essex does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements the tax exempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and we may be subject to additional contractual liability 

adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate investment risks

real property investments are subject to a variety of risks the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred if the properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures cash flow and ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected the performance of the economy in each of the areas in which the properties are located affects occupancy market rental rates and expenses 

consequently the income from the properties and their underlying values may be impacted the financial results of major local employers may have an impact on the cash flow and value of certain of the properties as well 

income from the properties may be further adversely affected by among other things the following factors 

the general economic climate 

local economic conditions in which the properties are located such as oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for rental space 

the attractiveness of the properties to tenants 

competition from other available space 

essexs ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance and 

increased operating expenses 

19 also as leases on the properties expire tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to us income and real estate values may also be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws eg the americans with disabilities act of 1990 and tax laws interest rate levels and the availability and terms of financing in addition real estate investments are relatively illiquid and therefore our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited 

the companys joint ventures and joint ownership of properties and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the companys ability to control such properties and partial interests

instead of purchasing properties directly we have invested and may continue to invest as a coventurer joint venturers often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that the coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or our policies or objectives consequently a coventurers actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk although we seek to maintain sufficient influence of any joint venture to achieve its objectives we may be unable to take action without our joint venture partners approval or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without consent additionally should a joint venture partner become bankrupt we could become liable for such partners share of joint venture liabilities 

from time to time we through the operating partnership invest in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing or managing real property in certain circumstances the operating partnerships interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnerships ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnerships objectives in addition the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity in addition we have and in the future may enter into transactions that could require us to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets into joint ventures or the operating partnership in the event that certain taxable events which are within our control occur although we plan to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on their sale pursuant to the likekind exchange rules under section 1031 of the internal revenue code we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on our financial position 

dedicated investment activities and other factors specifically related to essex apartment fund lp

we have recently organized an investment fund essex apartment value fund lp or the fund which will be subject to specific exceptions essexs exclusive investment vehicle for new investment until at least 90 of the funds committed capital has been invested or committed for investments or if earlier december 31 2003 we are committed to invest 214 of the aggregate capital committed to the fund this fund involves risks to essex such as the following essexs partners in the fund might become bankrupt in which event essex might become generally liable for the liabilities of the fund have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals fail to fund capital commitments as contractually required or fail to approve decisions regarding the fund that are in our best interest we will however generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over the fund to permit it to achieve its business objectives 

investments in mortgages and other real estate securities

we may invest in securities related to real estate which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders we may purchase securities issued by entities which own real estate and may also invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations these mortgages may be first second or third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed in general investments in mortgages include the following risks 

20 that the value of mortgaged property may be less than the amounts owed 

that interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than our cost of funds and 

in the case of junior mortgages that foreclosure of a senior mortgage would eliminate the junior mortgage 

if any of the above were to occur cash flows from operations and our ability to make expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected 

possible environmental liabilities

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property we carry certain insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk we have conducted environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater contamination at certain properties such contamination at certain of these properties was reported to have migrated onsite from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations the former industrial users of the properties were identified as the source of contamination the environmental studies noted that certain properties are located adjacent to any possible down gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination the lateral limits of which may extend onto such properties the environmental studies also noted that at certain of these properties contamination existed because of the presence of underground fuel storage tanks which have been removed in general in connection with the ownership operation financing management and development of real properties we may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities we may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to persons and property 

recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties other than us alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate mold related claims are often excluded from standard insurance policies should an uninsured mold related claim arise against us we could be required to use our own funds to resolve the claim and to make any needed cleanups to the involved property 

california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as proposition 65 requiring that clear and reasonable warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity including tobacco smoke although we have sought to comply with proposition 65 requirements there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition 65 

we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties 

general uninsured losses

we carry comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the properties there are however certain types of extraordinary losses for which we do not have insurance certain of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity we have obtained certain limited earthquake insurance coverage we may sustain losses due to insurance deductibles copayments on insured losses or uninsured losses or losses in excess of applicable coverage 

changes in real estate tax and other laws

generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants we also do not generally pass through increases in income service or other taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders in addition recent proposed changes to the tax law to eliminate most taxes on stock dividends may adversely affect us and other reits by reducing the demand for reit stocks generally

21 changes in financing policy no limitation on debt

we have adopted a policy of maintaining a debttototalmarket capitalization ratio of less than 50 the calculation of debttototalmarket capitalization is as follows total property indebtedness divided by the sum of total property indebtedness plus total equity market capitalization

as used in the above formula total market capitalization is equal to the aggregate market value of the outstanding shares of common stock based on the greater of current market price or the gross proceeds per share from public offerings of the outstanding shares plus any undistributed net cash flow assuming the conversion of all limited partnership interests in the operating partnership into shares of common stock and the gross proceeds of the preferred units of the operating partnership based on this calculation including the current market price and excluding undistributed net cash flow our debtto totalmarketcapitalization ratio was approximately 364 as of december 31 2002 

our organizational documents and the organizational documents of the operating partnership do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred accordingly the board of directors could change current policies and the policies of the operating partnership regarding indebtedness if these policies were changed we and the operating partnership could incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and the obligations of the operating partnership and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of essex such increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the properties 

failure to qualify as a reit

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code however we cannot assure you that we have qualified as a reit or that we will continue to so qualify in the future to qualify as a reit we must satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions only limited judicial or administrative interpretation exists for these provisions and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control in addition future legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may apply to us potentially with retroactive effect and adversely affect of ability to qualify as a reit we may receive significant nonqualifying income or acquire nonqualifying assets which as a result may cause us to approach the income and assets test limits imposed by the internal revenue code there is a risk that we may not satisfy these tests if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates we may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify this would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property

the companys multifamily properties accounted for in excess of 94 of the companys revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 

occupancy rates

the 112 multifamily residential properties had an average occupancy based on financial occupancy during the year ended december 31 2002 of approximately 95 with respect to stabilized multifamily properties with sufficient operating history occupancy figures are based on financial occupancy which is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue actual rental revenue represents contractual revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of financial occupancy 

as of december 31 2002 the headquarters building was 100 occupied by the company and the southern california office building was 88 occupied based on physical occupancy with respect to office buildings occupancy figures are based on physical occupancy which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied square footage by rentable square footage with respect to recreational vehicle parks manufactured housing communities or multifamily properties which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient operating history occupancy figures are based on physical occupancy which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied units by rentable units

critical accounting policies and estimates

the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis the company evaluates its estimates including those related to acquiring developing and assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties its investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates and qualification as a reit the company bases its estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from those estimates made by management

rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation on rental properties has been provided over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 30 years using the straightline method development costs include acquisition direct and indirect construction costs interest and real estate taxes incurred during the construction and property stabilizations periods maintenance and repair expenses that do not add to the value or prolong the useful life of the property are expensed as incurred asset replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 

the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures and by monitoring contract performance for properties under development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount is evaluated if the sum of the propertys expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges when the company determines that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 

with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties an impairment charge or investment valuation charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value 

we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code however we cannot assure you that we have qualified as a reit or that we will continue to so qualify in the future if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates we may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify this would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability even if we continue to qualify as a reit we will continue to be subject to certain federal state and local taxes on our income and property

35 the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions

36 results of operations

comparison of year ended december 31 2002 to year ended december 31 2001

average financial occupancy rates of the companys multifamily same store properties properties consolidated by the company for each of the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 decreased to 945 for the year ended december 31 2002 from 947 for the year ended december 31 2001 financial occupancy is defined as the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue actual rental revenue represents contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate financial occupancy may not completely reflect shortterm trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of financial occupancy 

the regional breakdown of financial occupancy for the same store properties for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 are as follows

interest and other income increased by 705000 or 32 to 22857000 in 2002 from 22152000 in 2001 the increase of 705000 primarily relates to the equity in income from the gain on sale of coinvestment assets and additional fee income earned in connection with the sale of coinvestment assets

total expenses decreased by 3689000 or approximately 27 to 131404000 in 2002 from 135093000 in 2001 this decrease was attributable to a decrease in interest expense which decreased by 3734000 or 96 to 35012000 in 2002 from 38746000 in 2001 a decrease in maintenance and repairs expense which decreased by 1471000 or 118 to 10971000 in 2002 from 12442000 in 2001 offset by an increase in insurance expense of 919000 or 809 to 2055000 in 2002 from 1136000 in 2001 the interest expense decrease was primarily due to declining interest rates the increase in insurance expense is due to the current conditions in the insurance industry resulting in higher premiums

discontinued operations increased by 7653000 to 8286000 in 2002 from 633000 in 2001 this is due to the gain on sale of tara village in 2002 of 8061000 partially offset by a reduction in operating income from such property due to its sale in 2002 minority interests decreased by 192000 or 08 to 24130000 in 2002 from 24322000 in 2001 this is primarily due to the decrease in net income of the operating partnership 

net income increased by 4329000 or 89 to 52874000 in 2002 from 48545000 in 2001 the increase in net income is mainly attributable to the factors noted above and the gain on sale of real estate of 8061000 recognized in 2002 as compared to the gain on sale of real estate of 3788000 recognized in 2001

total expenses increased by 21815000 or approximately 193 to 135093000 in 2001 from 113278000 in 2000 the most significant factor contributing to this increase was the growth in the companys multifamily portfolio from 83 properties 18673 units at january 1 2001 to 92 properties 20762 units at december 31 2001 interest expense increased by 8702000 or 290 to 38746000 in 2001 from 30044000 in 2000 such interest expense increase was primarily due to the net addition of mortgage debt in connection with property acquisitions and investments property operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization increased by 6186000 or 134 to 52277000 in 2001 from 46091000 in 2000 of such increase 4624000 is attributable to properties acquired or disposed of subsequent to january 1 2000 and the balance is attributable to an increase in operating expenses for the 20012000 same store properties property operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and amortization as a percentage of property revenues were 288 for 2001 and 278 for 2000 depreciation and amortization increased by 5473000 or approximately 180 to 35915000 in 2001 from 30442000 in 2000 primarily due to the acquisition of assets general and administrative expenses represent the costs of the companys various acquisition and administrative departments as well as corporate and partnership administration and nonoperating expenses such expenses increased by 1436000 in 2001 from the amount incurred in 2000 this increase is largely due to additional staffing requirements resulting from the growth of the company general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 37  for 2001 and 34 for 2000 

minority interests increased by 636000 or 27 to 24322000 in 2001 from 23686000 in 2000 this is primarily due to the increase in net income of the company 

net income increased by 4192000 to 48545000 in 2001 from 44353000 in 2000 net income for 2001 included a gain on sales of real estate of 3788000 as compared with 4022000 in 2000 net operating income of the acquisition properties and the increase in net operating income from the same store properties represent the largest contributions to the increase in net income

43 potential factors affecting future operating results

many factors affect the companys actual financial performance and may cause the companys future results to be different from past performance or trends these factors include 

economic environment

both the national economy and the economies of the western states in which the company owns manages and develops properties have been and continue to be in a recession this has resulted in reduced occupancy rates increased concessions and reductions in market rental rates 

the companys property type and diverse geographic locations provide some degree of risk moderation but are not immune to a prolonged down cycle in the real estate markets in which the company operates although the company believes it is well positioned to meet the challenges ahead it is possible that further reductions in occupancy and market rental rates will result in reduction of rental revenues operating income cash flows and the market value of the companys shares a prolonged recession could also affect the companys ability to obtain financing at acceptable rates of interest and to access funds from the disposition of properties at acceptable disposition prices 

interest rate fluctuations

the company monitors changes in interest rates and believes that it is well positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate risk perspective however current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase rapidly to levels more in line with recent historic levels the immediate effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher interest expense on the companys variable interest rate debt see item 7a and notes 7 and 8 to consolidated financial statements the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the companys ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and the companys ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 

44 inflation

property management and a customer satisfaction approach coupled with a
discipline of internal cost control the company seeks to retain tenants
maximize cash flow enhance property values and compete effectively for new
tenants in the marketplace the companys senior vice president of operations

revenue controlling expenses and creating a more efficient operating
environment

   business planning and control  real estate investment decisions are
accompanied by a multiple year plan to which executives and other managers
responsible for obtaining future financial performance must agree performance
versus plan serves as a significant factor in determining compensation

   property type focus  the company focuses on acquisition and development of
multifamily residential communities containing between 75 and 750 units these
types of properties offer attractive opportunities because such properties i
are often mispriced by real estate sellers and buyers who lack the companys
ability to obtain and use realtime market information ii provide
opportunities for value enhancement since many of these properties have been
owned by parties that are either inadequately capitalized or lack the
professional property management expertise of the company

                                      2

page

   geographic focus  the company focuses its property investments in markets
that meet the following criteria

     major metropolitan areas  the company focuses on metropolitan areas
      having a regional population in excess of one million people real estate
      markets in these areas are typically characterized by a relatively
      greater number of buyers and sellers and are therefore more liquid
      liquidity is an important element for implementing the companys strategy
      of varying its portfolio in response to changing market conditions

     supply constraints  the company believes that properties located in real
      estate markets with limited development opportunities are well suited to
      produce increased rental income when evaluating supply constraints the
      company reviews i availability of developable land sites on which
      competing properties could be readily constructed ii political
      barriers to growth resulting from a restrictive local political
      environment regarding development and redevelopment such an environment
      in addition to the restrictions on development itself is often
      associated with a lengthy development process and expensive development
      fees and iii physical barriers to growth resulting from natural
      limitations to development such as mountains or waterways

     rental demand created by high cost of housing  the company concentrates
      on markets in which the cost of renting compares favorably to the cost of
      owning a home in such markets rent levels tend to be higher and
      operating expenses and capital expenditures as a percentage of rent are
      lower in comparison with markets that have a lower cost of owning a home

     job proximity  the company believes that most renters select housing
      based on its proximity to their jobs and related commuting factors the
      company obtains local area information relating to its residential
      properties and uses this information when making multifamily residential
      property acquisition decisions the company also reviews the location of
      major employers relative to its portfolio and potential acquisition
      properties

   following the above criteria the company is currently pursuing investment
opportunities in selected markets of northern and southern california and the
pacific northwest

   active portfolio management through regional economic research and local
market knowledge  the company was founded on the belief that the key elements
of successful real estate investment and portfolio growth include extensive
regional economic research and local market knowledge the company utilizes its
economic research and local market knowledge to make appropriate portfolio
allocation decisions that it believes result in better overall operating
performance and lower portfolio risk the company maintains and evaluates

     regional economic data  the company evaluates and reviews regional
      economic factors for the markets in which it owns properties and where it
      considers expanding its operations the companys research focuses on
      regional and submarket supply and demand economic diversity job
      growth market depth and the comparison of rents to down payments and
      occupancy costs associated with singlefamily housing

     local market conditions  local market knowledge includes i local
      factors that influence whether a submarket is desirable to tenants ii
      the extent to which the area surrounding a property is improving or
      deteriorating and iii local investment market dynamics including the
      relationship between the value of a property and its yield the prospects
      for capital appreciation and market depth

   recognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical the company regularly
evaluates the results of regional economic and local market research and
adjusts portfolio allocations accordingly the company actively manages the
allocation of assets within its portfolio the company seeks to increase its
portfolio allocation in markets projected to have economic growth and to
decrease such allocations in markets projected to have declining economic
conditions likewise the company also seeks to increase its portfolio
allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease
such allocations in markets that have inflated valuations

  environmental matters

   under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations an
owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or
remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on in or migrating from
such property such laws often impose liability without regard as to whether
the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such
hazardous or toxic substances the presence of such substances or the failure
to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners or
operators ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such
property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of
hazardous or toxic substances or wastes also may be liable for the costs of
removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility
to which such substances or wastes were sent whether or not such facility is
owned or operated by such person in addition certain environmental laws
impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials acms into
the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real
properties for personal injury associated with acms in connection with the
ownership direct or indirect operation management and development of real
properties the company could be considered an owner or operator of such
properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or
toxic substances and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or
remediation costs as well as certain other costs including governmental fines
and costs related to injuries of persons and property

   recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and
managers of multifamily properties other than essex alleging personal injury
and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate
some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or
settlements insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by
excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold
endorsements at prohibitively high rates we have adopted programs designed to
minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines
for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact
mold might have on residents or the property

                                      9

   all of the properties have been subjected to preliminary environmental
assessments including a review of historical and public data phase i
assessments by independent environmental consultants phase i assessments
generally consist of an investigation of environmental conditions at the
property including a preliminary investigation of the site an identification
of publicly known conditions occurring at properties in the vicinity of the
site an investigation as to the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls
pcbs acms and aboveground and underground storage tanks presently or
formerly at the sites and preparation and issuance of written reports as a
result of information collected in the phase i assessments certain of the
properties were subjected to additional environmental investigations
including in a few cases soil sampling or ground water analysis to further
evaluate the environmental conditions of those properties

   the environmental studies revealed the presence of groundwater contamination
on certain of the properties certain of these properties had contamination
which was reported to have migrated onsite from adjacent industrial
manufacturing operations and one property was previously occupied by an
industrial user that was identified as the source of contamination the
environmental studies noted that certain of the properties are located adjacent
to and possibly downgradient from sites with known groundwater contamination
the lateral limits of which may extend onto such properties the environmental
studies also noted that contamination existed at certain properties because of
the former presence of underground fuel storage tanks that have been removed
there are asbestoscontaining material in a number of the properties primarily
in the form of ceiling texture floor tiles and adhesives which are generally
in good condition at properties where radon hydrogen sulfide or methane has
been identified as a potential concern the company has implemented remediating
measures andor additional testing based on its current knowledge the company
does not believe that future liabilities associated with asbestos radon
hydrogen sulfide or methane will be material based on the information
contained in the environmental studies the company believes that the costs if
any it might bear as a result of environmental contamination or other
conditions at these properties would not have a material adverse effect on the
companys financial condition result of operations or liquidity

   certain properties that have been sold by the company were identified as
having potential groundwater contamination while the company does not
anticipate any losses or costs related to groundwater contamination on
properties that have been sold it is possible that such losses or costs may
materialize in the future

   except with respect to one property the company has no indemnification
agreements from third parties for potential environmental cleanup costs at its
properties the company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of
any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown
environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly
owned by the company no assurance can be given that existing environmental
studies with respect to any of the properties reveal all environmental
liabilities that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any
material environmental condition not known to the company or that a material
environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of the
properties the company has limited insurance coverage for the types of
environmental liabilities described above

  insurance

   the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and
rental loss insurance for each of the properties there are however certain
types of extraordinary losses for which the company does not have insurance
all of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake
activity the company has obtained earthquake insurance for all the properties
most of the properties are included in an earthquake insurance program that is
subject to an aggregate limit of 400 million payable upon a covered loss in
excess of a 75 million selfinsured retention amount and a 5 deductible in
the future the company may selectively exclude properties from being covered
by earthquake insurance based on managements evaluation of the following
factors i the availability of coverage on terms acceptable to the company
ii the location of the property and the amount of seismic activity affecting
that region and iii the age of the property and building codes in effect at
the time of construction despite earthquake coverage on all of the companys
properties

                                      10

page

should a property sustain damage as a result of an earthquake the company may
incur losses due to deductibles copayments and losses in excess of applicable
insurance if any

   although the company carries certain insurance for nonearthquake damages to
its properties and liability insurance the company may still incur losses due
to uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable
insurance coverage

  competition

   the companys properties compete for tenants with similar properties
primarily on the basis of location rent charged services provided and the
design and condition of the improvements competition for tenants from
competing properties affects the amount of rent charged as well as rental
growth rates vacancy rates deposit amounts and the services and features
provided at each property while economic conditions are generally stable in
the companys target markets a prolonged economic downturn could have a
material adverse effect on the companys financial position results of
operations or liquidity

   the company also experiences competition when attempting to acquire
properties that meet its investment criteria such competing buyers include
domestic and foreign financial institutions other reits life insurance
companies pension funds trust funds partnerships and individual investors

  working capital

   the company expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements by using
its working capital cash generated from operations and its amounts available
on its lines of credit the company believes that its future net cash flows
will be adequate to meet operating requirements and to provide for payment of
dividends by the company in accordance with reit qualification requirements
the company has credit facilities in the committed amount of approximately
150000000 at december 31 2001 the company had an outstanding balance of
74459000 under these facilities

other mattersrisk factors

   our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences to
us these risks include among others the following

  debt financing

   at december 31 2001 the company had approximately 638660000 of
indebtedness including 133279000 of variable rate indebtedness of which
58820000 is capped at interest rates ranging from 71 to 73

   essex is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing
including the following

     cash flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal
      and interest

     inability to refinance existing indebtedness on encumbered properties and

     the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of
      existing indebtedness

  uncertainty of ability to refinance balloon payments

   at december 31 2001 the company had an aggregate of approximately
638660000 of mortgage debt and line of credit borrowings some of which are
subject to balloon payments of principal the company does not expect to have
sufficient cash flows from operations to make all of such balloon payments when
due under these mortgages and the line of credit borrowings at december 31
2001 these mortgages and lines of credit

                                      11

page

borrowings had the following scheduled maturity dates 2002868 million
includes lines of credit balance of 744 million as of december 31 2001
2003219 million 200440 million 2005360 million 2006151
million 2007 and thereafter4748 million the company may not be able to
refinance such mortgage indebtedness the properties subject to these mortgages
could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the mortgagee this could
mean a loss to the company of income and asset value alternatively the
company may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates if the
company is unable to make such payments when due a mortgage lender could
foreclose on the property securing the mortgage which could have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the
company

  risk of rising interest payments

   at december 31 2001 the company had approximately 58820000 of longterm
variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at a floating rate tied to the rate
of shortterm tax exempt securities which matures at various dates from 2020
through 2026 and 74459000 of variable rate indebtedness under its lines of
credit bearing interest at rates ranging from 1151175 over libor the
longterm variable rate indebtedness of approximately 58820000 is subject to
an interest rate protection agreement which may reduce the risks associated
with fluctuations in interest rates the remaining 74459000 of longterm
variable rate indebtedness is not subject to any interest rate protection
agreement and consequently an increase in interest rates may have an adverse
effect on net income and results of operations of the company

   current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase
rapidly to levels more in line with recent historic levels the immediate
effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher
interest expense in the companys variable rate indebtedness the effect of
prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the companys ability
to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment
and the companys ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates

  risk of losses on interest rate hedging arrangements

   the company has from time to time entered into agreements to reduce the
risks associated with increases in interest rates and may continue to do so
although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates
these agreements also may reduce the benefits to the company when interest
rates decline there can be no assurance that any such hedging arrangements can
be refinanced or that the company will be able to enter into other hedging
arrangements to replace existing ones if interest rates decline furthermore
interest rate movements during the term of interest rate hedging arrangements
may result in a gain or loss on the companys investment in the hedging
arrangement in addition if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same
rate as the indebtedness that is hedged the company may be exposed to losses
to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing
the hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally
nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the
company to increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit
risk the companys policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with
large financial institutions

  acquisition activities risks that acquisitions will fail to meet expectations

   the company intends to continue to acquire multifamily residential
properties there are risks that acquired properties will fail to perform as
expected estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements
necessary to allow the company to market an acquired property as originally
intended may prove to be inaccurate in addition the company expects to
finance future acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of
secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by
the operating partnership or additional equity by the company the use of
equity financing rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions
could dilute the interest of the companys existing stockholders if new
acquisitions are financed under existing lines of credit there is a risk that
unless substitute financing is obtained further availability under the lines
of credit for new development may not be available or may be available only on
disadvantageous terms

                                      12

page

also the company may not be able to refinance its existing lines of credit
upon maturity or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the
terms of the existing indebtedness further acquisitions of properties are
subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments see
adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate
investment risks

  risks that development activities will be delayed not completed and or
  fail to achieve expected results

   the company pursues multifamily residential property development projects
from time to time development projects generally require various governmental
and other approvals the receipt of which cannot be assured the companys
development activities generally entail certain risks including the following

     funds may be expended and managements time devoted to projects that may
      not be completed

     construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates possibly
      making the project economically unfeasible

     development projects may be delayed due to among other things adverse
      weather conditions

     occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than
      anticipated and

     expenses at a completed development may be higher than anticipated

   these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the companys
stockholders further the development of properties is also subject to the
general risks associated with real estate investments see adverse effect to
property income and value due to general real estate investment risks

  the geographic concentration of the properties and fluctuations in local
  market may adversely impact income

   significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2001
were derived from properties concentrated in northern california the san
francisco bay area southern california los angeles ventura orange and san
diego counties and the pacific northwest the seattle washington and
portland oregon metropolitan areas of our 92 ownership interests in
multifamily residential properties 65 are located in california as a result
of this geographic concentration if a local property market performs poorly
the income from the properties in that market could decrease as a result of
such a decrease in income the company may be unable to pay expected dividends
to the companys stockholders the performance of the economy in each of these
areas affects occupancy market rental rates and expenses and consequently
impacts the income generated from the properties and their underlying values
the financial results of major local employers may also impact the cash flow
and value of certain of the properties economic downturns in the local markets
in which the company owns properties could have a negative impact on the
financial condition and results from operations of the company

   both the national economy and the economies of the western states in which
the company owns manages and develops properties have been and continue to be
in a recession the early indicators of how this affects the real estate
industry in general and the company in particular are slightly reduced
occupancy rates flattening and reductions in market rental rates

   the companys property type and diverse geographic locations provide some
degree of risk moderation but are not immune to a prolonged down cycle in the
real estate markets in which the company operates although the company
believes it is well positioned to meet the challenges ahead it is possible
that further reductions in occupancy and market rental rates will result in
reduction of rental revenues operating income cash flows and market value of
the companys shares prolonged recession could also affect the companys
ability to obtain financing at acceptable rates of interest and to access funds
from the disposition of properties at acceptable disposition prices

  competition in the multifamily residential market may adversely affect
  operations and the rental demand for the companys properties

   there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the multifamily
properties in attracting residents these include other multifamily rental
apartments and singlefamily homes that are available for rent in the markets
in which the properties are located the properties also compete for residents
with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale if the demand
for the companys properties is reduced or if competitors develop andor
acquire competing properties on a more costeffective basis rental rates may
drop which may have a material adverse affect on the financial condition and
results of operations of the company

   the company also faces competition from other real estate investment trusts
businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of
properties some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial
resources than the company this competition may result in increased costs of
properties the company acquires andor develops

  debt financing on properties may result in insufficient cash flow

   where possible the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase
the rate of return on its investments and to provide for additional investments
that the company could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow
from the properties will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations
and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust
provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the company may
obtain additional debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or
all of the properties these mortgages may be recourse nonrecourse or
crosscollateralized as of december 31 2001 the company had 43 properties
encumbered by debt of the 43 properties 24 are secured by deeds of trust
relating solely to those properties and with respect to the remaining 19
properties five crosscollateralized mortgages are secured by eight
properties three properties three properties three properties and two
properties respectively the holders of this indebtedness will have a claim
against these properties and to the extent indebtedness is cross
collateralized lenders may seek to foreclose upon properties which are not
the primary collateral for their loan this may in turn accelerate other
indebtedness secured by properties foreclosure of properties would cause a
loss to the company of income and asset value

  increase in dividend requirements as a result of preferred stock may lead to
  a possible inability to sustain dividends

   in 1998 and 1999 the operating partnership issued 210 million in aggregate
of series b cumulative redeemable preferred units the series b preferred
units series c cumulative redeemable preferred units the series c
preferred units series d cumulative redeemable preferred units the series
d preferred units and series e cumulative redeemable preferred units the
series e preferred units the series b preferred units the series c
preferred units the series d preferred units and the series e preferred units
are collectively referred to herein as the preferred units

   the terms of the preferred stock into which each series of preferred units
are exchangeable provide for certain cumulative preferential cash distributions
per each share of preferred stock these terms also provide that while such
preferred stock is outstanding no distributions may be authorized declared or
paid on the common stock unless all distributions accumulated on all shares of
such preferred stock have been paid in full the distributions payable on such
preferred stock may impair the companys ability to pay dividends on its common
stock

   if the company wishes to issue any common stock in the future including
upon exercise of stock options the funds required to continue to pay cash
dividends at current levels will be increased the companys ability to pay
dividends will depend largely upon the performance of the properties and other
properties that may be acquired in the future

                                      14

   the companys ability to pay dividends on the companys stock is further
limited by the maryland general corporation law under the maryland general
corporation law the company may not make a distribution on stock if after
giving effect to such distribution either

     the company would not be able to pay its indebtedness as it becomes due
      in the usual course of business or

     the companys total assets would be less than its total liabilities

   if the company cannot pay dividends on its stock its status as a real
estate investment trust may be jeopardized

  existing registration rights and preemptive rights may have an adverse effect
  on the market price of the shares

   registration rights are held by the senior members of the companys
management and certain outside investors collectively the operating
partnership holders who as of december 31 2001 owned approximately 110
limited partnership interests in the operating partnership these rights
include certain demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to
shares of common stock issuable in connection with the exchange of their
limited partnership interests in the operating partnership the aggregate 110
limited partnership interests held by the operating partnership holders in
the operating partnership is exchangeable for an aggregate of 2286082 shares
of common stock in addition the operating partnership has invested in certain
real estate partnerships certain partners in such limited partnerships have
the right to have their limited partnership interests in such partnerships
redeemed for cash or at the companys option for 1511533 shares of common
stock these partners also have certain demand and piggyback registration
rights with respect to the shares of common stock that may be issued in
exchange for such limited partnership interests all of the registration rights
discussed above could materially adversely affect the market price for the
shares of common stock

  our chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments
  which may lead to conflicts of interest

   our chairman george marcus owns interests in various other real
estaterelated business and investments he is the chairman of the marcus 
millichap company mm which is the holding company for real estate
brokerage and services companies mm has an interest in pacific properties a
company that invests in west coast multifamily residential properties the
company has sold an office building which it previously occupied to the marcus
 millichap company

   mr marcus has entered into an agreement with the company whereby the
company has the right of first refusal to acquire multifamily properties under
contract by marcus  millichap and its affiliates in situations where both the
company and marcus  millichap have offered to purchase the property
notwithstanding this agreement mr marcus and affiliated entities may
potentially compete with the company in acquiring multifamily properties which
competition may be detrimental to the company in addition due to such
potential competition for real estate investments mr marcus and affiliated
entities may have a conflict of interest with the company which may be
detrimental to the interests of the companys shareholders

  the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders
  may be detrimental to holders of common stock

   as of december 31 2001 george m marcus the chairman of the companys
board of directors wholly or partially owned 1972929 shares of common stock
including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in
the operating partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise
of all vested options this represents approximately 95 of the outstanding
shares of common stock mr marcus

currently does not have majority control over the company however he
currently has and likely will continue to have significant influence with
respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant
corporate actions consequently his influence could result in decisions that
do not reflect the interests of all stockholders of the company

   under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of
the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for any
amendment of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions through their
ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions in the company
the companys directors and executive officers including messrs marcus and
millichap have substantial influence on the company consequently their
influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all
stockholders of the company

  the voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to
  impede actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock

   in general the holders of the preferred stock into which the companys
preferred units are exchangeable do not have any voting rights however if
full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock for six
quarterly distributions periods the holders of preferred stock who have not
received distributions voting together as a single class will have the right
to elect two additional directors to serve on the companys board of directors
these voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and
distributions for the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have been
paid in full at that time the holders of the preferred stock are divested of
these voting rights and the term and office of the directors so elected
immediately terminates

   in addition while any shares of preferred stock into which the preferred
units are exchangeable are outstanding the company 1 may not authorize or
create any class of series of stock that ranks senior to this preferred stock
with respect to the payment of dividends rights upon liquidation dissolution
or windingup of the company or 2 amend alter or repeal the provisions of
the companys charter or bylaws that would materially and adversely af fect
these rights without the consent of the holders of twothirds of the
outstanding shares of each series of preferred stock as applicable each
voting separately as a single class also while any shares of preferred stock
are outstanding the company may not 1 merge or consolidate with another
entity or 2 transfer substantially all of its assets to any corporation or
other entity without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least
twothirds of each series of preferred stock each voting separately as a
class unless the transaction meets certain criteria these voting rights of
the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede or veto
actions by the company that would otherwise benefit the holders of the
companys common stock

  exemption of george marcus from the maryland business combination law may
  allow certain transactions between the company and george marcus to proceed
  without compliance with such law

   the maryland general corporation law establishes special requirements for
business combinations between a maryland corporation and interested
stockholders unless exemptions are applicable an interested stockholder is
any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the
thenoutstanding voting stock among other things the law prohibits for a
period of five years a merger and other similar transactions between the
company and an interested stockholder unless the board of directors approved
the transaction prior to the party becoming an interested stockholder the
fiveyear period runs from the most recent date on which the interested
stockholder became an interested stockholder

   the law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions
after the end of the fiveyear period this means that the transaction must be
approved by at least

     80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting
      shares and

     66 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting
      shares other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom the
      business combination is to be effected

                                      16

   however as permitted by the statute the board of directors irrevocably has
elected to exempt any business combination by the company george m marcus
william a millichap who are the chairman and a director of the company
respectively and the marcus  millichap company mm or any entity owned or
controlled by messrs marcus and millichap and mm consequently the fiveyear
prohibition and the supermajority vote requirement described above will not
apply to any business combination between the company and mr marcus mr
millichap or mm as a result the company may in the future enter into
business combinations with messrs marcus and millichap and mm without
compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of
the maryland general corporation law

  antitakeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement
  charter bylaws and certain provisions of maryland law could delay defer or
  prevent a change in control of the company

   while the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership
and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the
management and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the
operating partnerships partnership agreement place limitations on the
companys ability to act with respect to the operating partnership such
limitations could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control
of the company that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be
in the best interest of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely
affect the interest of the stockholders the partnership agreement provides
that if the limited partners own at least 5 of the outstanding units of
limited partnership interest in the operating partnership the company cannot
without first obtaining the consent of a majorityininterest of the limited
partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion of the
companys general partner interest in the operating partnership to another
entity such limitations on the companys ability to act may result in the
company being precluded from taking action that the board of directors believes
is in the best interests of the companys stockholders in addition as of
december 31 2001 two individuals together held more than 50 of the
outstanding units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership
allowing such actions to be blocked by a small number of limited partners

   the companys charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common
stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other
terms of such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common
stock although the company has no intention to issue any additional shares of
preferred stock at the present time the company may establish one or more
series of preferred stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a
change in control of the company such a transaction might involve a premium
price for the companys stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the
holders of common stock also such a class of preferred stock could have
dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of
holders of common stock

   the companys charter as well as its stockholder rights plan also contains
other provisions that may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in
control of the company that might be in the best interest of the companys
stockholders the companys stockholder rights plan is designed among other
things to prevent a person or group from gaining control of the company
without offering a fair price to all of the companys stockholders also the
bylaws may be amended by the board of directors to include provisions that
would have a similar effect although the company presently has no such
intention the charter contains ownership provisions limiting the
transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock which may have the
effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in
control of the company for example subject to receiving an exemption from the
board of directors potential acquirers may not purchase more than 6 percent
in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire
99 this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders
of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium
for their shares of common stock

   in addition the maryland general corporations law restricts the voting
rights of shares deemed to be control shares under the maryland general
corporations law control shares are those which when aggregated with any
other shares held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting
power within

                                      17

specified ranges although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share
provisions of the maryland general corporations law the provisions of the
bylaws may be amended or eliminated by the board of directors at any time in
the future moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of
the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the
maryland general corporations law not only to control shares which may be
acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the
provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share
provisions of the maryland general corporations law could delay defer or
prevent a transaction or change in control of the company that might involve a
premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of its
stockholders

  the companys guarantee of the director and executive stock purchase program
  may lead to liability for the company

   in september 1999 the company formed a program in which directors and
management of the company can participate indirectly in an investment in the
companys common stock the participants have entered into a swap agreement
with a securities broker whereby the securities broker has acquired in open
marked transactions 223475 shares of the companys common stock the
agreement terminates in five years or earlier under certain circumstances at
which time the settlement amount is determined by comparing the original
purchase price of the stock plus interest at a rate of libor plus 15 to the
termination date market value of the shares and all dividends received during
the investment period in certain circumstances the participants may be
required to provide collateral to the securities broker the company has
guaranteed performance of the participants with respect to any obligations
relating to the swap agreement due to this guarantee if the swap agreement
upon its termination results in a net loss to participants the company could
be liable for paying the loss further if collateral is required to be
advanced to the securities broker the company could be obligated to make such
advance which in turn could be costly to the company from august 2001 through
january 2002 the directors and management effected an early termination of the
agreement with respect to 120718 shares of the total 223475 shares realizing
a gain of approximately 15 per share

  bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain properties

   at december 31 2001 the company had approximately 588 million of
taxexempt financing relating to the inglenook court apartments wandering
creek apartments treetops apartments huntington breakers apartments and
camarillo oaks apartments this taxexempt financing subjects these properties
to certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants the company expects to
engage in taxexempt financings in the future in addition the internal
revenue code of 1986 as amended the code and its related regulations
impose various restrictions conditions and requirements excluding interest on
qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes
the code also requires that at least 20 of apartment units be made available
to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed 50 of the median income for
the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development
department of the federal government in addition to federal requirements
certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions
these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed properties if
the company is required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy
the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of
apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements the
taxexempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the
bond documents may be accelerated and the company may be subject to additional
contractual liability

  adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate
  investment risks

   real property investments are subject to a variety of risks the yields
available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income
generated and expenses incurred if the properties do not generate sufficient
income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital
expenditures cash flow and ability to make distributions to stockholders will
be adversely affected the performance of the economy in each of the areas in
which the properties are located affects occupancy market rental rates and
expenses

                                      18

page

consequently the income from the properties and their underlying values may be
impacted the financial results of major local employers may have an impact on
the cash flow and value of certain of the properties as well

   income from the properties may be further adversely affected by among other
things the following factors

     the general economic climate

     local economic conditions in which the properties are located such as
      oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for rental space

     the attractiveness of the properties to tenants

     competition from other available space

     the companys ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance
      and

     increased operating expenses

   also as leases on the properties expire tenants may enter into new leases
on terms that are less favorable to the company income and real estate values
may also be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws eg the
americans with disabilities act of 1990 and tax laws interest rate levels and
the availability and terms of financing in addition real estate investments
are relatively liquid and therefore the companys ability to vary its
portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may
be adversely affected

  the companys joint ventures and joint ownership of properties and partial
  interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the companys
  ability to control such properties and partial interests

   instead of purchasing properties directly the company has invested and may
continue to invest as a coventurer joint venturers often have shared control
over the operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that
the coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or
business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the companys business
interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to the
companys instructions or requests or to company policies or objectives
consequently a coventurers actions might subject property owned by the joint
venture to additional risk although the company seeks to maintain sufficient
control of any joint venture to achieve its objectives the company may be
unable to take action without the companys joint venture partners approval
or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture
without consent additionally should a joint venture partner become bankrupt
the company could become liable for such partners share of joint venture
liabilities

   from time to time the company through the operating partnership invests
in corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other
entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing or
managing real property in certain circumstances the operating partnerships
interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding
voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnerships ability
to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore
the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the
board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or
partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event
that its operations conflict with the operating partnerships objectives in
addition the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests
in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the
operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances
to the entity

   in addition the company has and in the future may enter into transactions
that could require it to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute
assets into joint ventures or the company operating partnership for negotiated
periods of the years in the event that certain taxable events which are within
the companys control occur although the company plans to hold the
contributed assets or defer recognition per internal revenue code section 1031
this is no assurance that it will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities
were incurred they would have a material impact on the companys financial
position

  dedicated investment activities and other factors specifically related to the
  fund

   the company has recently organized an investment fund the essex apartment
value fund lp the fund which will be subject to specific exceptions
the companys exclusive investment vehicle for new investment until at least
90 of the funds committed capital has been invested or committed for
investments or if earlier december 31 2003 the company is committed to
invest 214 of the aggregate capital committed to the fund this fund involves
risks to essex such as the following essexs partners in the fund might become
bankrupt in which event essex might become generally liable for the
liabilities of the fund or have economic or business interests or goals that
are inconsistent with the companys business interests or goals or fail to
approve decisions regarding the fund that are in the best interest of the
company essex will however generally seek to maintain sufficient control
over the fund to permit it to achieve its business objectives

  investments in mortgages and other real estate securities

   the company may invest in securities related to real estate which could
adversely affect its ability to make distributions to stockholders the company
may purchase securities issued by entities which own real estate and may also
invest in mortgages these mortgages may be first second or third mortgages
that may or may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed the company anticipates
that such investment in mortgage receivables will not in the aggregate be
significant in general investments in mortgages include the following risks

     that the value of mortgaged property may be less than the amounts owed

     that interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than the
      companys cost of funds and

     in the case of junior mortgages that foreclosure of a senior mortgage
      would eliminate the junior mortgage

   if any of the above were to occur cash flows from operations and the
companys ability to make expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely
affected

  possible environmental liabilities

   investments in real property create a potential for environmental
liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property the company carries
certain insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk the company has
conducted environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater
contamination at certain properties such contamination at certain of these
properties was reported to have migrated onsite from adjacent industrial
manufacturing operations the former industrial users of the properties were
identified as the source of contamination the environmental studies noted that
certain properties are located adjacent to any possible down gradient from
sites with known groundwater contamination the lateral limits of which may
extend onto such properties the environmental studies also noted that at
certain of these properties contamination existed because of the presence of
underground fuel storage tanks which have been removed in general in
connection with the ownership operation financing management and development
of real properties the company may be potentially liable for removal or
cleanup costs as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities
the company may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to
injuries to persons and property

   recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and
managers of multifamily properties other than essex alleging personal injury
and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate
mold related claims are often excluded from standard insurance policies should
an uninsured mold related claim arise against essex we could be required to
use our own funds to resolve the claim and to make any needed cleanups to the
involved property

   california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as proposition 65
requiring that clear and reasonable warnings be given to consumers who are
exposed to chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive
toxicity including tobacco smoke although essex has sought to comply with
proposition 65

                                      20

requirements there can be no assurance that essex will not be adversely
affected by litigation relating to proposition 65

   essex cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of its
properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner of any of
our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to
essex or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as
to any one or more of its properties

  general uninsured losses

   the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and
rental loss insurance for each of the properties there are however certain
types of extraordinary losses for which the company does not have insurance
certain of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake
activity the company has obtained certain limited earthquake insurance
coverage the company may sustain losses due to insurance deductibles
copayments on insured losses or uninsured losses or losses in excess of
applicable coverage

  changes in real estate tax and other laws

   generally the company does not directly pass through costs resulting from
changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants the company
also does not generally pass through increases in income service or other
taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect funds from
operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly
compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for
environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on
discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws
or other laws regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated
expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the
ability to make distributions to stockholders

  changes in financing policy no limitation on debt

   the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a
debttototalmarketcapitalization ratio of less than 50 the calculation of
debttototalmarketcapitalization is as follows


                                                                 
                  total property indebtedness                         debttototalmarketcapitalization

total property indebtedness  total equity market capitalization


   as used in the above formula total market capitalization is equal to the
aggregate market value of the outstanding shares of common stock based on the
greater of current market price or the gross proceeds per share from public
offerings of the outstanding shares plus any undistributed net cash flow
assuming the conversion of all limited partnership interests in the operating
partnership into shares of common stock and the gross proceeds of the preferred
units of the operating partnership based on this calculation including the
current market price and excluding undistributed net cash flow the companys
debttototalmarketcapitalization ratio was approximately 338 as of
december 31 2001

   the companys organizational documents and the organizational documents of
the operating partnership do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness
that may be incurred accordingly the board of directors could change current
policies and the policies of the operating partnership regarding indebtedness
if these policies were changed the company and the operating partnership could
incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on the companys
obligations and the obligations of the operating partnership and an increase
in debt service requirements that could adversely affect the financial
condition and results of operations of the company such increased debt could
exceed the underlying value of the properties

  failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust

   the company has operated as a qualified real estate investment trust under
the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended commencing with the taxable year
ended december 31 1994 although the company believes that it has operated in
a manner which satisfies the real estate investment trust qualification
requirements no assurance can be given that the company will continue to do
so a real estate investment trust is generally not taxed on its net income
distributed to its stockholders it is required to distribute at least 90 of
its taxable income to maintain qualification as a real estate investment trust
qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the satisfaction of
numerous requirements some on an annual or quarterly basis established under
the highly technical and complex internal revenue code of 1986 as amended
provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative
interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and
circumstances not entirely within the companys control

   if the company fails to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any
taxable year it would generally be subject to federal and state income tax
including any applicable alternative minimum tax at corporate rates on its
taxable income for such year moreover unless entitled to relief under certain
statutory provisions the company would also be disqualified from treatment as
a real estate investment trust for the four taxable years following the year of
disqualification this treatment would reduce net earnings available for
investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax
liability for the years involved in addition distributions would no longer be
required to be made

critical accounting policies and estimates

   in response to the secs release number 338040 cautionary advice
regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies the company
identifies the following critical accounting areas that affect its more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated
financial statements the related accounting policies are included here and in
the notes to the consolidated financial statements

   the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america
requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis the company
evaluates its estimates including those related to acquiring developing and
assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties and its investments
in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates the company bases its
estimates on historical experience current market conditions and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances

   rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation
depreciation on rental properties has been provided over estimated useful lives
ranging from 3 to 30 years using the straightline method development costs
include acquisition direct and indirect construction costs interest and real
estate taxes incurred during the construction period and certain operating
expenses prior to property stabilization maintenance and repair expenses that
do not add to the value or prolong the useful life of the property are expensed
as incurred asset replacements and improvements are capitalized and
depreciated over their estimated useful lives

   the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by
monitoring performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint
ventures and by monitoring contract performance for properties under
development local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values
of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a
property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the carrying amount
is evaluated if the sum of the propertys expected future cash flows
undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of
the property then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the
excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property adverse
changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate
investments could result in impairment charges when the company determines
that a property is held for sale it discontinues the periodic depreciation of
that property assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell

   with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and
affiliates the company looks to the underlying properties to assess
performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in
a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties an impairment
charge or investment valuation charge is recorded if the carrying value of the
investment exceeds its fair value

   the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances
actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be
different under different assumptions or conditions

in property revenues from the same store properties property revenues from the
same store properties increased by approximately 52 to 135727000 in 2001
from 129031000 in 2000 a significant portion of this increase was
attributable to the 14 multifamily same store properties located in northern
california the property revenues of these properties increased by 3832000
or 73 to 56646000 in 2001 from 52814000 in 2000 this 3832000
increase is primarily attributable to rental rate increases which were offset
by a decrease in average financial occupancy to 954 in 2001 from 980 in
2000 the 15 multifamily same store properties located in southern california
accounted for the next largest contribution to the same store properties
revenues increased the property revenues of these properties increased by
2243000 or 55  to 43338000 in 2001 from 41095000 in 2000 this

increase the property revenues of these properties increased by 621000 or
18 to 35743000 in 2001 from 35122000 in 2000 this 621000 increase is
attributable to rental rate increases which were offset by a decrease in
financial occupancy to 945 in 2001 from 959 in 2000

   the increase in total revenue also reflected an increase of 11183000
attributable to interest and other income which primarily relates to income
and fees earned on the companys investments in joint ventures and interest
income earned on outstanding notes receivable and cash balances

   total expenses increased by 21938000 or approximately 192 to
136478000 in 2001 from 114540000 in 2000 the most significant factor
contributing to this increase was the growth in the companys multifamily
portfolio from 83 properties 18673 units at january 1 2001 to 92 properties
20762 units at december 31 2001 interest expense increased by 8721000
or 287 to 39105000 in 2001 from 30384000 in 2000 such interest expense
increase was primarily due to the net addition of mortgage debt in connection
with property acquisitions and investments which was offset by an increase in
the capitalization of interest charges on the companys development and
redevelopment communities of 1011000 or approximately 348 to 3917000
from 2906000 in 2000 property operating expenses exclusive of depreciation
and amortization increased by 6233000 or 133 to 52923000 in 2001 from
46690000 in 2000 of such increase 4624000 is attributable to properties
acquired or disposed of subsequent to january 1 2000 and the balance is
attributable to an increase in operating expenses for the same store
properties property operating expenses exclusive of depreciation and
amortization as a percentage of property revenues were 288 for 2001 and
278 for 2000 depreciation and amortization increased by 5530000 or
approximately 180 to 36295000 in 2001 from 30765000 in 2000 primarily
due to the acquisition of assets general and administrative expenses represent
the costs of the companys various acquisition and administrative departments
as well as corporate and partnership administration and nonoperating expenses
such expenses increased by 1436000 in 2001 from the amount incurred in 2000
this increase is largely due to additional staffing requirements resulting from
the growth of the company general and administrative expenses as a percentage
of total revenues were 36  for 2001 and 34 for 2000

   minority interests increased by 649000 or 27 to 24399000 in 2001 from
23750000 in 2000 this is primarily due to the increase in net income of the
company

in 2000 net income for 2001 included a gain on sales of real estate of
3788000 as compared with 4022000 in 2000 net operating income of the

increase in average financial occupancy to 982 in 2000 from 966 in 1999

for 2000 and 29 for 1999

   minority interests increased by 5912000 or 331 to 23750000 in 2000

potential factors affecting future operating results

   many factors affect the companys actual financial performance and may cause
the companys future results to be different from past performance or trends
these factors include

  economic environment

   both the national economy and the economies of the western states in which
the company owns manages and develops properties have been and continue to be
in a recession this has resulted in reduced occupancy rates and flattening
and reductions in market rental rates

   the companys property type and diverse geographic locations provide some
degree of risk moderation but are not immune to a prolonged down cycle in the
real estate markets in which the company operates although the company
believes it is well positioned to meet the challenges ahead it is possible
that further reductions in occupancy and market rental rates will result in
reduction of rental revenues operating income cash flows and market value of
the companys shares prolonged recession could also affect the companys
ability to obtain financing at acceptable rates of interest and to access funds
from the disposition of properties at acceptable disposition prices

interest rate fluctuations

   the company monitors changes in interest rates and believes that it is well
positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate risk perspective however
current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase
rapidly to levels more in line with recent historic levels the immediate
effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher
interest expense on the companys variable interest rate debt see item 7a and
note 7 and 8 to consolidated financial statements the effect of prolonged
interest rate increases could negatively impact the companys ability to make
acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and the
companys ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates

inflations

   inflationary increases would likely have a negative effect on property
operating results and such increases may be at a greater rate of increases than
property rental rates in a period of recession the company believes it
effectively manages its property and other expenses but understands that a
return to higher annual rates of inflation would result in increases to
operating expense

funds from operations

   industry analysts generally consider funds from operations funds from
operations an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit
generally funds from operations adjusts the net income of equity reits for
noncash charges such as depreciation and amortization of rental properties
gains losses on sales of real estate and extraordinary items management
considers funds from operations to be a useful financial performance
measurement of an equity reit because together with net income and cash flows
funds from operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate
the performance of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions
and other capital expenditures funds from operations does not represent net
income or cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted
accounting principles gaap and is not intended to indicate whether cash flows
will be sufficient to fund cash needs it should not be considered as an
alternative to net income as an indicator of the reits operating performance
or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity funds from operations does not
measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs including
principal amortization capital improvements and distributions to shareholders
funds from operations also does not represent cash flows generated from
operating investing or financing activities as defined under gaap further
funds from operations as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the
companys

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

   the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its
line of credit and longterm debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital
expenditures and expansion of the companys real estate investment portfolio
and operations the companys interest rate risk management objective is to
limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to
lower its overall borrowing costs to achieve its objectives the company
borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial
instruments such as interest rate swaps caps and treasury locks in order to
mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument the company
does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative
purposes

   the companys interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest
rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and
sensitivity to interest rate changes the company believes that the principal
amounts of the companys mortgage notes payable and line of credit approximate
fair value as of december 31 2001 as interest rates are consistent with yields
currently available to the company for similar instruments

include acquisition direct and indirect construction costs interest and real
estate taxes incurred during the construction period and certain operating
expenses prior to property stabilization

useful life of the property are expensed as incurred asset replacements and
improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives

   certain rental properties are pledged as collateral for the related mortgage
notes payable

   whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable the
carrying amount will be evaluated if the sum of the propertys expected future
cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the
carrying amount of the property then the company will recognize an impairment
loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the
property

derivative instrument are reported initially as a component of other
comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the
forecasted transaction affects earnings changes in the ineffective portion of

  k  accounting pronouncements

   in july 2001 the fasb issued statement no 141 business combinations
and statement no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 141
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business
combinations initiated after june 30 2001 and also specifies the criteria that
intangible assets acquired in a business combination must meet in order to be
recognized and reported apart from goodwill statement 142 eliminates the
requirement to amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives but instead requires testing of these assets for impairment at least
annually statement 142 also requires that intangible with definite useful
lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their
estimated residual values the company does not expect the adoption of
statements 141 and 142 to have a material effect on the financial statements

   in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 accounting for the
impairment of disposal of longlived assets sfas no 144 supercedes sfas no
121  accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived
assets to be disposed of sfas no 144 develops one accounting model for
longlived assets that are to be disposed of by sale the company will adopt
sfas no 144 effective january 1 2002 the company believes that the adoption
of sfas no 144 will not have a material impact on the companys financial
statements

   in october 1997 the company entered into four forward treasury contracts
for an aggregate notional amount of 60000 locking the 10year treasury rate
at between 615 and 626 these contracts were entered into to limit the
interest rate exposure on identified future debt financing requirements
relating to real estate under development and the refinancing of a 18101
fixed rate loan these contracts were settled by june 2000 during 2000 the
four contracts were sold resulting in a net realized gain of 1384 which is
being amortized over the related debt

   during the years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 the company
refinanced various mortgages and incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of
debt of 0 119 and 214 related to the writeoff of the unamortized mortgage
loan fees and prepayment penalties

   during transactions through 1999 the company purchased interest rate cap
contracts in order to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest
rates on its tax exempt variable rate demand bonds the company has the right
to receive cash if interest rates increase above a specified level the purpose
of the caps is to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future interest
cash flows above a fixed interest rate and accordingly they are accounted
for as cash flow hedges under sfas 133 the company determines the fair value
of the caps and assesses the ineffectiveness of the hedge based on changes in
the time value of the caps as of january 1 2001 there were no changes in the
intrinsic value of the caps since the date the caps were purchased and the
changes in fair value of the caps is attributable entirely to changes in time
value the amortized cost of the cap contracts exceeded their fair value by
approximately 450 which resulted in a transition adjustment charge to
earnings of that amount in the quarter ended march 31 2001

         financing alternatives including alternative financing sources through
         joint ventures broadening the companys access to capital

business principles


the company was founded on has followed and intends to continue to follow the
business principles set forth below

property management  through its longstanding philosophy of active property
management and a customer satisfaction approach coupled with a discipline of
internal cost control the company seeks to retain tenants maximize cash flow
enhance property values and compete effectively for new tenants in the
marketplace  the companys senior vice president of operations and the regional
portfolio managers are accountable for overall property operations and
performance  they supervise onsite managers provide training for the onsite
staff monitor fiscal performance against budgeted expectations monitor
property performance against the performance of competing properties in the
area prepare operating and capital budgets for executive approval and
implement new strategies focused on enhancing tenant satisfaction increasing
revenue controlling expenses and creating a more efficient operating
environment

business planning and control  real estate investment decisions are accompanied
by a multiple year plan to which executives and other managers responsible for
obtaining future financial performance must agree  performance versus plan
serves as a significant factor in determining compensation

property type focus  the company focuses on acquisition and development of
multifamily residential communities containing between 75 and 750 units  these
types of properties offer attractive opportunities because such properties i
are often mispriced by real estate sellers and buyers who lack the companys
ability to obtain and use realtime market information ii provide
opportunities for value enhancement since many of these properties have been
owned by parties that are either inadequately capitalized or lack the
professional property management expertise of the company

geographic focus  the company focuses its property investments in markets that
meet the following criteria

         major metropolitan areas the company focuses on metropolitan areas
          having a regional population in excess of one million people real
          estate markets in these areas are typically characterized by a
          relatively greater number of buyers and sellers and are therefore
          more liquid liquidity is an important element for implementing the
          companys strategy of varying its portfolio in response to changing
          market conditions

         supply constraints the company believes that properties located in
          real estate markets with limited development or redevelopment
          opportunities are well suited to produce increased rental income when
          evaluating supply constraints the company reviews i availability
          of developable land sites on which competing properties could be
          readily constructed ii political barriers to growth resulting from
          a restrictive local political environment regarding development and
          redevelopment such an environment in addition to the restrictions on
          development itself is often associated with a lengthy development
          process and expensive development fees and iii physical barriers
          to growth resulting from natural limitations to development such as
          mountains or waterways

         rental demand created by high cost of housing the company
          concentrates on markets in which the cost of renting compares
          favorably to the cost of owning a home in such markets rent levels
          tend to be higher and operating expenses and capital expenditures as
          a percentage of rent are lower in comparison with markets that have a
          lower cost of owning a home

         job proximity the company believes that most renters select housing
          based on its proximity to their jobs and on related commuting factors
          the company obtains local area information relating to its residential
          properties and uses this information when making multifamily
          residential property acquisition decisions the company also reviews
          the location of major employers relative to its portfolio and
          potential acquisition properties

following the above criteria the company is currently pursuing investment
opportunities in selected markets of northern and southern california and the
pacific northwest

active portfolio management through regional economic research and local market
knowledge  the company was founded on the belief that the key elements of
successful real estate investment and portfolio growth include extensive
regional economic research and local market knowledge the company utilizes its
economic research and local market knowledge to make appropriate portfolio
allocation decisions that it believes result in better overall operating
performance and lower portfolio risk  the company maintains and evaluates

         regional economic data the company evaluates and reviews regional
          economic factors for the markets in which it owns properties and where
          it considers expanding its operations the companys research focuses
          on regional and submarket supply and demand economic diversity job
          growth market depth and the comparison of rents to down payments and
          occupancy costs associated with singlefamily housing

         local market conditions local market knowledge includes i local
          factors that influence whether a submarket is desirable to tenants
          ii the extent to which the area surrounding a property is improving
          or deteriorating and iii local investment market dynamics
          including the relationship between the value of a property and its
          yield the prospects for capital appreciation and market depth

                                       2

recognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical the company regularly
evaluates the results of regional economic and local market research and adjusts
portfolio allocations accordingly the company actively manages the allocation
of assets within its portfolio the company seeks to increase its portfolio
allocation in markets projected to have economic growth and to decrease such
allocations in markets projected to have declining economic conditions
likewise the company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets
that have attractive property valuations and to decrease such allocations in
markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields  although the
company is generally a longterm investor it does not establish defined or
preferred holding periods for its properties

current business activities


the company conducts substantially all of its activities through the operating
partnership of which it owns an approximate 896 general partnership interest
the approximate 104 limited partnership interests in the operating partnership
are owned by directors officers and employees of the company and certain third
party investors  as the sole general partner of the operating partnership the
company has operating control over the management of the operating partnership
and each of the properties  from time to time the company may invest in
properties through the acquisition of an interest in another entity based upon
the criteria described above  the company does not plan to invest in any
securities of other entities not engaged in real estate related activities

the company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust reit
for federal income tax purposes commencing with the year ended december 31
1994 the company provides some of its feebased asset management and
disposition services as well as thirdparty property management and leasing
services through essex management corporation emc in order to maintain
compliance with reit tax rules  the company owns 100 of emcs 19000 shares of
nonvoting preferred stock  executives of the company own 100 of emcs 1000
shares of common stock

in the second quarter of 2000 the company invested in three joint venture
partnerships in which it holds limited partnership interests  two of these
partnerships own one multifamily property and the other partnership owns another
multifamily property  these investments were made under arrangements whereby
emc became the general partner and the other limited partners were granted the
right to require the applicable partnership to redeem their interest for cash
subject to certain conditions the company may however elect to deliver an
equivalent number of shares of the companys common stock in satisfaction of the
applicable partnerships cash redemption obligation

california and other western states have experienced shortages of electricity
and significantly higher natural gas prices caused by the failure to expand
capacity and transmission infrastructure consistent with the regions economic
growth  residents of the multifamily properties operated by the company are
typically billed directly for the cost of gas and electricity or energy used
in their apartment home  as a result the companys responsibility for energy
costs is typically associated with the operation of the leasing office swimming
pools spas and other amenities site lighting and vacant apartment units  in
addition many of the multifamily properties utilize a boiler system to produce
hot water that is provided to residents at the companys expense  in 2000 the
company incurred costs for natural gas and electricity in the operations of its
communities averaged 22 per unit per month  electrical power disruption and
higher energy costs could adversely affect the local economies in which the
companys multifamily properties are located which in turn could adversely
affect the revenues from those properties and the companys results of
operations in general

acquisitions


during 2000 the company acquired ownership interests in twelve multifamily
properties consisting of 2813 units with an aggregate purchase price of
approximately 227600000 these investments were primarily funded by the
contribution of equity from joint venture partners issuance of operating
partnership units which are convertible into common stock of the company cash
generated from operations proceeds from the dispositions of properties
proceeds from new and assumed loans and the companys lines of credit  of the
twelve properties purchased in 2000 seven properties 1834 units are located
in southern california three 540 units are located in northern california and
two 439 units are located in the pacific northwest

environmental matters


under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations an
owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or
remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on or in such property
such laws often impose liability without regard as to whether the owner or
operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such hazardous or
toxic substances  the presence of such substances or the failure to properly
remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners or operators
ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as
collateral  persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or
toxic substances or wastes also may be liable for the costs of removal or
remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility to which
such substances or wastes were sent whether or not such facility is owned or
operated by such person  in addition certain environmental laws impose
liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials acms into the air
and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties
for personal injury associated with acms in connection with the ownership
direct or indirect operation management and development of real properties
the company could be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as
having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances
and therefore may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs as
well as certain other costs including governmental fines and costs related to
injuries of persons and property

all of the properties have been subjected to preliminary environmental
assessments including a review of historical and public data phase i
assessments by independent environmental consultants  phase i assessments
generally consist of an investigation of environmental conditions at the
property including a preliminary investigation of the site an identification
of publicly known conditions occurring at  properties in the vicinity of the
site an investigation as to the presence of polychlorinated biphenyls
pcbs acms and aboveground and underground storage tanks presently or
formerly at the sites and preparation and issuance of written reports  as a
result of information collected in the phase i assessments certain of the
properties were subjected to additional environmental investigations including
in a few cases soil sampling or ground water analysis to further evaluate the
environmental conditions of those properties

the environmental studies revealed the presence of groundwater contamination on
certain of the properties  certain of these properties had contamination which
was reported to have migrated onsite from adjacent industrial manufacturing
operations and one property was previously occupied by an industrial user that
was identified as the source of contamination  the environmental studies noted
that certain of the properties are located adjacent to and possibly down
gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination the lateral limits of
which may extend onto such properties  the environmental studies also noted
that contamination existed at certain properties because of the former presence
of underground fuel storage tanks that have been removed  there are asbestos
containing material in a number of the properties primarily in the form of
ceiling texture floor tiles and adhesives which are generally in good
condition  at properties where radon hydrogen sulfide or methane has been
identified as a potential concern the company has implemented remediating
measures andor additional testing  based on its current knowledge the company
does not believe that future liabilities associated with asbestos radon
hydrogen sulfide or methane will be material based on the information contained
in the environmental studies the company believes that the costs if any it
might bear as a result of environmental contamination or other conditions at
these properties would not have a material adverse effect on the companys
financial condition result of operations or liquidity

certain properties that have been sold by the company were identified as having
potential groundwater contamination  while the company does not anticipate any
losses or costs related to groundwater contamination on properties that have
been sold it is possible that such losses or costs may materialize in the
future

except with respect to one property the company has no indemnification
agreements from third parties for potential environmental cleanup costs at its
properties   the company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude
of any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown
environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly
owned by the company  no assurance can be given that existing environmental
studies with respect to any of the properties reveal all environmental
liabilities that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any
material environmental condition not known to the company or that a material
environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of the
properties  the company has limited insurance coverage for the types of
environmental liabilities described above

insurance


the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental
loss insurance for each of the properties  there are however certain types of
extraordinary losses for which the company does not have insurance  all of the
properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity  the
company has obtained earthquake insurance for all the properties  this
earthquake insurance is subject to an aggregate limit of 400 million payable
upon a covered loss in excess of a 75 million selfinsured retention amount
and a 5 deductible  the company may selectively exclude properties from being
covered by earthquake insurance based on managements evaluation of the
following factors i the availability of coverage on terms acceptable to the
company ii the location of the property and the amount of seismic activity
affecting that region and iii the age of the property and building codes in
effect at the time of construction  despite earthquake coverage on all of the
companys properties should a property sustain damage as a result of an
earthquake the company may incur losses due to deductibles copayments and
losses in excess of applicable insurance if any

although the company carries certain insurance for nonearthquake damages to its
properties and liability insurance the company may still incur losses due to
uninsured risks deductibles copayments or losses in excess of applicable
insurance coverage

competition


the companys properties compete for tenants with similar properties primarily
on the basis of location rent charged services provided and the design and
condition of the improvements  competition for tenants from competing
properties affects the amount of rent charged as well as rental growth rates
vacancy rates deposit amounts and the services and features provided at each
property while economic conditions are generally stable in the companys target
markets a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on
the companys financial position results of operations or liquidity

the company also experiences competition when attempting to acquire properties
that meet its investment criteria  such competing buyers include domestic and
foreign financial institutions other reits life insurance companies pension
funds trust funds partnerships and individual investors

working capital


the company expects to meet its shortterm liquidity requirements by using its
working capital cash generated from operations and its amounts available on
its lines of credit  the company believes that its future net cash flows will
be adequate to meet operating requirements and to provide for payment of
dividends by the company in accordance with reit qualification requirements
the company has credit facilities in the committed amount of approximately
150000000 at december 31 2000 the company had an outstanding balance of
93469000 under these facilities


other mattersrisk factors

debt financing


at december 31 2000 the company had approximately 595535000 of indebtedness
including 170513000 of variable rate indebtedness of which 58820000 is
capped at interest rates ranging from 71 to 73

  essex is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing
  including the following

   cash flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and
   interest

   inability to refinance existing indebtedness on encumbered properties and

   the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing
   indebtedness

uncertainty of ability to refinance balloon payments

at december 31 2000 the company had an aggregate of approximately 595535000
of mortgage debt and line of credit borrowings some of which are subject to
balloon payments of principal the company does not expect to have sufficient
cash flows from operations to make all of such balloon payments when due under
these mortgages and the line of credit borrowings at december 31 2000 these
mortgages and lines of credit borrowings had the following scheduled maturity
dates 2001  281 million 2002  978 million 2003  209 million 2004 
29 million 2005  349 million 2006 and thereafter  4109 million the
company may not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness the properties
subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to
the mortgage this could mean a loss to the company of income and asset value
alternatively the company may be required to refinance the debt at higher
interest rates if the company is unable to make such payments when due a
mortgage lender could foreclose on the property securing the mortgage which
could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of
operations of the company

risk of rising interest payments

at december 31 2000 the company had approximately 58820000 of longterm
variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at a floating rate tied to the rate
of shortterm tax exempt securities which matures at various dates from 2020
through 2026 18224000 of longterm variable rate indebtedness bearing
interest at 175 over libor which matures in may 2001 and 93469000 of
variable rate indebtedness under its lines of credit bearing interest at rates
ranging from 115  1175 over libor  although 58820000 of longterm
variable rate indebtedness is subject to an interest rate protection agreement
which may reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates the
remaining 111693000 of longterm variable rate indebtedness is not subject to
any interest rate protection agreement consequently an increase in interest
rates may have an adverse effect on net income and results of operations of the
company

risk of losses on interest rate hedging arrangements

the company has from time to time entered into agreements to reduce the risks
associated with increases in interest rates and may continue to do so
although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates
these agreements also may reduce the benefits to the company when interest rates
decline there can be no assurance that any such hedging arrangements can be
refinanced or that the company will be able to enter into other hedging
arrangements to replace existing ones if interest rates decline furthermore
interest rate movements during the term of interest rate hedging arrangements
may result in a gain or loss on the companys investment in the hedging
arrangement in addition if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same
rate as the indebtedness that is hedged the company may be exposed to losses to
the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the
hedging arrangement change independently of each other finally nonperformance
by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject the company to


                                       7
page

increased credit risks in order to minimize counterparty credit risk the
companys policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with large financial
institutions

acquisition activities risks that acquisitions will fail to meet expectations

the company intends to continue to acquire multifamily residential properties
there are risks that acquired properties will fail to perform as expected
estimates of future income expenses and the costs of improvements necessary to
allow the company to market an acquired property as originally intended may
prove to be inaccurate in addition the company expects to finance future
acquisitions in whole or in part under various forms of secured or unsecured
financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating
partnership or additional equity by the company the use of equity financing
rather than debt for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the
interest of the companys existing stockholders if new acquisitions are
financed under existing lines of credit there is a risk that unless substitute
financing is obtained further availability under the lines of credit for new
development may not be available or may be available only on disadvantageous
terms also the company may not be able to refinance its existing lines of
credit upon maturity or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable
as the terms of the existing indebtedness  further acquisitions of properties
are subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments see
adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate
investment risks

risks that development activities will be delayednot completed and or fail to
achieve expected results

the company pursues multifamily residential property development projects from
time to time development projects generally require various governmental and
other approvals the receipt of which cannot be assured the companys
development activities generally entail certain risks including the following

   funds may be expended and managements time devoted to projects that may not
   be completed

   construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates possibly making
   the project economically unfeasible

   development projects may be delayed due to among other things adverse
   weather conditions

   occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than
   anticipated and

   expenses at a completed development may be higher than anticipated

these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the companys
stockholders further the development of properties is also subject to the
general risks associated with real estate investments see adverse effect to
property income and value due to general real estate investment risks

the geographic concentration of the properties and fluctuations in local market
may adversely impact income

significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december 31 2000
were derived from properties concentrated in northern california the san
francisco bay area southern california los angeles ventura orange and san
diego counties and the pacific northwest the seattle washington and
portland oregon metropolitan areas as a result of this geographic
concentration if a local property market performs poorly the income from the
properties in that market could decrease as a result of such a decrease in
income the company may be unable to pay expected dividends to the companys
stockholders the performance of the economy in each of these areas affects
occupancy market rental rates and expenses and consequently impacts the income
generated from the properties and their underlying values the financial results
of major local employers may also impact the cash flow and value of certain of
the properties economic downturns in the local markets in which the company
owns properties could have a negative impact on the financial condition and
results from operations of the company

of our 83 ownership interests in multifamily residential properties 57 are
located in california  a downturn in either the california economy or in
california real estate conditions could adversely affect our financial condition
and results of operations

competition in the multifamily residential market may adversely affect
operations and the rental demand for the companys properties

there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the multifamily
properties in attracting residents these include other multifamily rental
apartments and single family homes that are available for rent in the markets in
which the properties are located the properties also compete for residents with
new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale if the demand for the
companys properties is reduced or if competitors develop andor acquire
competing properties on a more costeffective basis rental rates may drop
which may have a material adverse affect on the financial condition and results
of operations of the company

the company also faces competition from other real estate investment trusts
businesses and other entities in the acquisition development and operation of
properties some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial
resources than the company this competition may result in increased costs of
properties the company acquires andor develops

debt financing on properties may result in insufficient cash flow

where possible the company intends to continue to use leverage to increase the
rate of return on its investments and to provide for additional investments that
the company could not otherwise make there is a risk that the cash flow from
the properties will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and
the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of
the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the company may obtain additional
debt financing in the future through mortgages on some or all of the
properties these mortgages may be recourse nonrecourse or cross
collateralized as of december 31 2000 the company had 41 properties
encumbered by debt  of the 41 properties 22 are secured by deeds of trust
relating solely to those properties and with respect to the remaining 19
properties five crosscollateralized mortgages are secured by eight properties
three properties three properties three properties and two properties
respectively the holders of this indebtedness will have a claim against these
properties and to the extent indebtedness is crosscollateralized lenders may
seek to foreclose upon properties which are not the primary collateral for their
loan this may in turn accelerate other indebtedness secured by properties
foreclosure of properties would cause a loss to the company of income and asset
value

increase in dividend requirements as a result of preferred stock may lead to a
possible inability to sustain dividends

in 1998 and 1999 the operating partnership issued 210 million in aggregate of
series b cumulative redeemable preferred units the series b preferred units
series c cumulative redeemable preferred units the series c preferred
units series d cumulative redeemable preferred units the series d preferred
units and series e cumulative redeemable preferred units the series e
preferred units  the series b preferred units the series c preferred units
the series d preferred units and the series e preferred units are collectively
referred to herein as the preferred units

the terms of the preferred stock into which each series of preferred units are
exchangeable provide for certain cumulative preferential cash distributions per
each share of preferred stock  these terms also provide that while such
preferred stock is outstanding no distributions may be authorized declared or
paid on the common stock unless all distributions accumulated on all shares of
such preferred stock have been paid in full  the distributions payable on such
preferred stock and on the convertible preferred stock may impair the companys
ability to pay dividends on its common stock

if the company wishes to issue any common stock in the future including upon
exercise of stock options the funds required to continue to pay cash dividends
at current levels will be increased  the companys ability to pay dividends
will depend largely upon the performance of the properties and other properties
that may be acquired in the future

the companys ability to pay dividends on the companys stock is further limited
by the maryland general corporation law  under the maryland general corporation
law the company may not make a distribution on stock if after giving effect to
such distribution either

   the company would not be able to pay its indebtedness as it becomes due in
   the usual course of business or

   the companys total assets would be less than its total liabilities

if the company cannot pay dividends on its stock its status as a real estate
investment trust may be jeopardized

existing registration rights and preemptive rights may have an adverse effect on
the market price of the shares

registration rights are held by the senior members of the companys management
and certain outside investors collectively the operating partnership
holders who as of december 31 2000 owned approximately 104 limited
partnership interests in the operating partnership these rights include certain
demand and piggyback registration rights with respect to shares of common
stock issuable in connection with the exchange of their limited partnership
interests in the operating partnership the aggregate 104 limited partnership
interests held by the operating partnership holders in the operating
partnership is exchangeable for an aggregate of 2129430 shares of common
stock in addition the operating partnership has invested in certain real
estate partnerships certain partners in such limited partnerships have the
right to have their limited partnership interests in such partnerships redeemed
for cash or at the companys option for 1070450 shares of common stock
these partners also have certain demand and piggyback registration rights
with respect to the shares of common stock that may be issued in exchange for
such limited partnership interests  all of the registration rights discussed
above could materially adversely affect the market price for the shares of
common stock

our chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments which
may lead to conflicts of interest

our chairman george marcus owns interests in various other real estaterelated
business and investments  he is the chairman of the marcus  millichap company
mm which is a real estate brokerage firm  mm has an interest in pacific
properties a company that invests in west coast multifamily residential
properties  the company has sold an office building which it previously
occupied the marcus  millichap company

mr marcus has entered into an agreement with the company whereby the company
has the right of first refusal to acquire multifamily properties under contract
by marcus  millichap and its affiliates  notwithstanding this agreement mr
marcus and affiliated entities may potentially compete with the company in
acquiring multifamily properties which competition may be detrimental to the
company  in addition due to such potential competition for real estate
investments mr marcus and affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest
with the company which may be detrimental to the interests of the companys
shareholders

the influence of executive officers directors and significant stockholders may
be detrimental to holders of common stock

as of december 31 2000 george m marcus the chairman of the companys board
of directors beneficially owned 1969183 shares of common stock including
shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating
partnership and assuming exercise of all vested options this represents
approximately 96 of the outstanding shares of common stock mr marcus
currently does not have majority control over the company however he currently
has and likely will continue to have significant influence with respect to the
election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate
actions  consequently his influence could result in decisions that do not
reflect the interests of all stockholders of the company

under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership the consent of the
holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for any amendment
of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions  through their ownership
of limited partnership interests and their positions in the company the
companys directors and executive officers including messrs  marcus and
millichap have substantial influence on the company  consequently their
influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all
stockholders of the company

the voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to
impede actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock

in general the holders of the preferred stock into which the companys
preferred units are exchangeable do not have any voting rights  however if
full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock for six
quarterly distributions periods the holders of preferred stock who have not
received distributions voting together as a single class will have the right
to elect two additional directors to serve on the companys board of directors
these voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and
distributions for the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have been
paid in full  at that time the holders of the preferred stock are divested of
these voting rights and the term and office of the directors so elected
immediately terminates

in addition while any shares of preferred stock into which the preferred units
are exchangeable are outstanding the company 1 may not authorize or create
any class of series of stock that ranks senior to this preferred stock with
respect to the payment of dividends rights upon liquidation dissolution or
windingup of the company or 2 amend alter or repeal the provisions of the
companys charter or bylaws that would materially and adversely affect these
rights without the consent of the holders of twothirds of the outstanding
shares of each series of preferred stock as applicable each voting separately
as a single class  also while any shares of preferred stock are outstanding
the company may not 1 merge or consolidate with another entity or 2
transfer substantially all of its assets to any corporation or other entity
without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least twothirds of each
series of preferred stock each voting separately as a class unless the
transaction meets certain criteria  these voting rights of the preferred stock
may allow holders of preferred stock to impede or veto actions by the company
that would otherwise benefit the holders of the companys common stock

exemption of george marcus from the maryland business combination law may allow
certain transactions between the company and george marcus to proceed without
compliance with such law

the maryland general corporation law establishes special requirements for
business combinations between a maryland corporation and interested
stockholders unless exemptions are applicable an interested stockholder is any
person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the
thenoutstanding voting stock among other things the law prohibits for a
period of five years a merger and other similar transactions between the company
and an interested stockholder unless the board of directors approved the
transaction prior to the party becoming an interested stockholder the five year
period runs from the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became
an interested stockholder the law also requires a supermajority stockholder
vote for such transactions after the end of the five year period this means
that the transaction must be approved by at least

   80 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares
   and

   66 of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares
   other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom the business
   combination is to be effected

however as permitted by the statute the board of directors irrevocably has
elected to exempt any business combination by the company george m marcus
william a millichap who are the chairman and a director of the company
respectively and the marcus  millichap company mm or any entity owned or
controlled by messrs marcus and millichap and mm consequently the fiveyear
prohibition and the supermajority vote requirement described above will not
apply to any business combination between the company and mr marcus mr
millichap or mm as a result the company may in the future enter into
business combinations with messrs marcus and millichap and mm without
compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the
maryland general corporation law

antitakeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement
charter bylaws and certain provisions of maryland law could delay defer or
prevent a change in control of the company

while the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and
generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management
and control of the operating partnership certain provisions of the operating
partnerships partnership agreement place limitations on the companys ability
to act with respect to the operating partnership such limitations could delay
defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control of the company that might
involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interest of
the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of the
stockholders the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners
own at least 5 of the outstanding units of limited partnership interest in the
operating partnership the

                                      10
page

company cannot without first obtaining the consent of a majorityininterest of
the limited partners in the operating partnership transfer all or any portion
of the companys general partner interest in the operating partnership to
another entity such limitations on the companys ability to act may result in
the company being precluded from taking action that the board of directors
believes is in the best interests of the companys stockholders in addition as
of december 31 2000 two individuals together held more than 50 of the
outstanding units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership
allowing such actions to be blocked by a small number of limited partners

the companys charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common
stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences rights and other
terms of such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common
stock  although the company has no intention to issue any additional shares of
preferred stock at the present time the company may establish one or more
series of preferred stock that could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a
change in control of the company such a transaction might involve a premium
price for the companys stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the
holders of common stock also such a class of preferred stock could have
dividend voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of
holders of common stock

the companys charter as well as its stockholder rights plan also contains
other provisions that may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in
control of the company that might be in the best interest of the companys
stockholders the companys stockholder rights plan is designed among other
things to prevent a person or group from gaining control of the company without
offering a fair price to all of the companys stockholders also the bylaws may
be amended by the board of directors to include provisions that would have a
similar effect although the company presently has no such intention  the
charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership
of shares of capital stock which may have the effect of delaying deferring or
preventing a transaction or a change in control of the company  for example
subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors potential
acquirers may not purchase more than 6 percent in value of the stock other
than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 99 this may discourage
tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit
the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common
stock

in addition the maryland general corporations law restricts the voting rights
of shares deemed to be control shares under the maryland general corporations
law control shares are those which when aggregated with any other shares
held by the acquirer entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within
specified ranges although the bylaws exempt the company from the control share
provisions of the maryland general corporations law the provisions of the
bylaws may be amended or eliminated by the board of directors at any time in the
future  moreover any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the
bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the
maryland general corporations law not only to control shares which may be
acquired in the future but also to control shares previously acquired if the
provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated the control share provisions
of the maryland general corporations law could delay defer or prevent a
transaction or change in control of the company that might involve a premium
price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of its stockholders

the companys guarantee of the director and executive stock purchase program may
lead to liability for the company

in september 1999 the company formed a program in which directors and
management of the company can participate indirectly in an investment in the
companys common stock  the participants have entered into a swap agreement
with a securities broker whereby the securities broker has acquired in open
marked transactions 223475 shares of the companys common stock  the
agreement terminates in five years or earlier under certain circumstances at
which time the settlement amount is determined by comparing the original
purchase price of the stock plus interest at a rate of libor plus 15 to the
termination date market value of the shares and all dividends received during
the investment period  in certain circumstances the participants may be
required to provide collateral to the securities broker  the company has
guaranteed performance of the participants with respect to any obligations
relating to the swap agreement  due to this guarantee if the swap agreement
upon its termination results in a net loss to participants the company could
be liable for paying the loss further if collateral is required to be advanced
to the securities broker the company could be obligated to make such advance
which in turn could be costly to the company

bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain properties

at december 31 2000 the company had approximately 588 million of taxexempt
financing relating to the inglenook court apartments wandering creek
apartments treetops apartments meadowood apartments and camarillo oaks
apartments this taxexempt financing subjects these properties to certain deed
restrictions and restrictive covenants the company expects to engage in tax
exempt financings in the future in addition the internal revenue code of 1986
as amended the code and its related regulations impose various
restrictions conditions and requirements excluding interest on qualified bond
obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes the code also
requires that at least 20 of apartment units be made available to residents
with gross incomes that do not exceed 50 of the median income for the
applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development
department of the federal government in addition to federal requirements
certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions
these restrictions may limit income from the taxexempt financed properties if
the company is required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy
the median income test if the company does not reserve the required number of
apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements the tax
exempt status of the bonds may be terminated the obligations under the bond
documents may be accelerated and the company may be subject to additional
contractual liability

adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate
investment risks

real property investments are subject to a variety of risks the yields
available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income
generated and expenses incurred if the properties do not generate sufficient
income to meet operating expenses including debt service and capital
expenditures cash flow and ability to make distributions to stockholders will
be adversely affected the

                                      11
page

performance of the economy in each of the areas in which the properties are
located affects occupancy market rental rates and expenses consequently the
income from the properties and their underlying values may be impacted the
financial results of major local employers may have an impact on the cash flow
and value of certain of the properties as well

  income from the properties may be further adversely affected by among other
  things the following factors

   the general economic climate

   local economic conditions in which the properties are located such as
   oversupply of space or a reduction in demand  for rental space

   the attractiveness of the properties to tenants

   competition from other available space

   the companys ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance and

   increased operating expenses

also as leases on the properties expire tenants may enter into new leases on
terms that are less favorable to the company income and real estate values may
also be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws eg the
americans with disabilities act of 1990 and tax laws interest rate levels and
the availability and terms of financing in addition real estate investments
are relatively illiquid and therefore the companys ability to vary its
portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be
adversely affected

the companys joint ventures and joint ownership of properties and partial
interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the companys
ability to control such properties and partial interests

instead of purchasing properties directly the company has invested and may
continue to invest as a coventurer  joint venturers often have shared control
over the operation of the joint venture assets therefore it is possible that
the coventurer in an investment might become bankrupt or have economic or
business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the companys business
interests or goals or be in a position to take action contrary to the companys
instructions or requests or to company policies or objectives consequently a
coventurers actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to
additional risk  although the company seeks to maintain sufficient control of
any joint venture to achieve its objectives the company may be unable to take
action without the companys joint venture partners approval or joint venture
partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without consent
additionally should a joint venture partner become bankrupt the company could
become liable for such partners share of joint venture liabilities

from time to time the company through the operating partnership invests in
corporations limited partnerships limited liability companies or other
entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring developing or
managing real property in certain circumstances the operating partnerships
interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding
voting interests of that entity therefore the operating partnerships ability
to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited furthermore
the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the
board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or
partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event
that its operations conflict with the operating partnerships objectives in
addition the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests
in such an entity in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent the
operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances
to the entity

in addition the company has and in the future may enter into transactions that
could require it to pay the tax liabilities of partners which contribute assets
into joint ventures or the companys operating partnership for negotiated
periods of the years in the event that certain taxable events which are within
the companys control occur although the company plans to hold the contributed
assets or defer recognition per internal revenue code section 1031 this is no
assurance that it will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were
incurred they would have a material impact on the companys financial position

investments in mortgages and other real estate securities

the company may invest in securities related to real estate which could
adversely affect its ability to make distributions to stockholders  the company
may purchase securities issued by entities which own real estate and may also
invest in mortgages these mortgages may be first second or third mortgages
that may or may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed the company anticipates
that such investment in mortgage receivables will not in the aggregate be
significant in general investments in mortgages include the following risks

   that the value of mortgaged property may be less than the amounts owed

   that interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than the companys
   cost of funds and

   in the case of junior mortgages that foreclosure of a senior mortgage would
   eliminate the junior mortgage

if any of the above were to occur cash flows from operations and the companys
ability to make expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected

                                      12

possible environmental liabilities

investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on
the part of the owner of such real property  the company carries certain
insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk  the company has
conducted environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater
contamination at certain properties such contamination at certain of these
properties was reported to have migrated onsite from adjacent industrial
manufacturing operations  the former industrial users of the properties were
identified as the source of contamination  the environmental studies noted that
certain properties are located adjacent to any possible down gradient from sites
with known groundwater contamination the lateral limits of which may extend
onto such properties  the environmental studies also noted that at certain of
these properties contamination existed because of the presence of underground
fuel storage tanks which have been removed in general in connection with the
ownership operation financing management and development of real properties
the company may be potentially liable for removal or cleanup costs as well as
certain other costs and environmental liabilities the company may also be
subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to persons and
property

general uninsured losses

the company carries comprehensive liability fire extended coverage and rental
loss insurance for each of the properties there are however certain types of
extraordinary losses for which the company does not have insurance   certain of
the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity the
company has obtained certain limited earthquake insurance coverage  the company
may sustain losses due to insurance deductibles copayments on insured losses
or uninsured losses or losses in excess of applicable coverage

changes in real estate tax and other laws

generally the company does not directly pass through costs resulting from
changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants the company
also does not generally pass through increases in income service or other
taxes to tenants under leases these costs may adversely affect funds from
operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders similarly
compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for
environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on
discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws
or other laws regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated
expenditures which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability
to make distributions to stockholders

changes in financing policy no limitation on debt

the company has adopted a policy of maintaining a debttototalmarket
capitalization ratio of less than 50 the calculation of debttototalmarket
capitalization is as follows


                                                                       
  total property indebtedness
           debttototalmarketcapitalization
  total property indebtedness  total equity market capitalization


as used in the above formula total market capitalization is equal to the
aggregate market value of the outstanding shares of common stock based on the
greater of current market price or the gross proceeds per share from public
offerings of the outstanding shares plus any undistributed net cash flow
assuming the conversion of all limited partnership interests in the operating
partnership into shares of common stock and the gross proceeds of the preferred
units of the operating partnership based on this calculation including the
current market price and excluding undistributed net cash flow the companys
debttototalmarketcapitalization ratio was approximately 305 as of december
31 2000

the companys organizational documents and the organizational documents of the
operating partnership do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that
may be incurred accordingly the board of directors could change current
policies and the policies of the operating partnership regarding indebtedness
if these policies were changed the company and the operating partnership could
incur more debt resulting in an increased risk of default on the companys
obligations and the obligations of the operating partnership and an increase in
debt service requirements that could adversely affect the financial condition
and results of operations of the company such increased debt could exceed the
underlying value of the properties

failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust

the company has operated as a qualified real estate investment trust under the
internal revenue code of 1986 as amended commencing with the taxable year
ended december 31 1994 although the company believes that it has operated in a
manner which satisfies the real estate investment trust qualification
requirements no assurance can be given that the company will continue to do so
a real estate investment trust is generally not taxed on its net income
distributed to its stockholders  it is required to distribute at least 90 of
its taxable income to maintain qualification as a real estate investment trust
qualification as a real estate investment trust involves the satisfaction of
numerous requirements some on an annual or quarterly basis established under
the highly technical and complex internal revenue code of 1986 as amended
provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative
interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and
circumstances not entirely within the companys control

if the company fails to qualify as a real estate investment trust in any taxable
year it would generally be subject to federal and state income tax including
any applicable alternative minimum tax at corporate rates on its taxable income
for such year moreover unless

                                      13
page

entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions the company would also be
disqualified from treatment as a real estate investment trust for the four
taxable years following the year of disqualification this treatment would
reduce net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders
because of the additional tax liability for the years involved in addition
distributions would no longer be required to be made

return of capital


under provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the portion
of cash dividend that exceeds earnings and profits is a return of capital  the
return of capital is generated due to the deduction of noncash expenses
primarily depreciation in the determination of earnings and profits  the
status of the cash dividends distributed for the years ended december 31 2000
1999 and 1998 for tax purposes is as follows



                                        
                                 2000    1999      1998

the most significant factor that caused an increase in the 1998 return of
capital percentage as compared to 2000 and 1999 was that in 1998 the company
incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of 4718000 as compared to

property revenues from the same store properties property revenues from the
same store properties increased by approximately 92 to 118836000 in 2000
from 108841000 in 1999  the majority of this increase was attributable to
the 12 multifamily same store properties located in northern california the
property revenues of which increased by 5703000 or 143 to 45408000 in
2000 from 39705000 in 1999 this 5703000 increase is primarily
attributable to rental rate increases and an increase in average financial
occupancy to 982 in 2000 from 966 in 1999  the 13 multifamily same store
properties located in southern california accounted for the next largest
contribution to this same store property revenues increase  the property
revenues of these properties increased by 2485000 or 69 to 38306000 in
2000 from 35821000 in 1999  this 2485000 increase is primarily
attributable to rental rate increases which were offset in part by a decrease
in average financial occupancy to 963 in 2000 from 968 in 1999  the 19
multifamily same store properties located in the pacific northwest accounted for
the next largest contribution to this same store property revenues increase

attributable to interest and other income which primarily relates to income and
fees earned on the companys investments in joint ventures and interest income
earned on outstanding notes receivable and cash balances

in 2000 from 93953000 in 1999 the most significant factor contributing to

properties 15106 units at january 1 1999 to 83 properties 18673 units at
december 31 2000  interest expense increased by 9116000 or 429 to
30384000 in 2000 from 21268000 in 1999  such interest expense increase
was primarily due to the net addition of mortgage debt in connection with
property and investment acquisitions and a decrease in the capitalization of
interest charges on the companys development and redevelopment communities of
2266000 or approximately 438 to 2906000 from 5172000 in 1999

minority interests increased by 5912000 to 23750000 in 2000 from

and renovation expenditures required pursuant to taxexempt bond financings
the company expects that cash from operations andor its lines of credit will
fund such expenditures  however there can be no assurance that the actual
expenditures incurred during 2001 andor the funding thereof will not be
significantly different than the companys current expectations

funds from operations

industry analysts generally consider funds from operations funds from
operations an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit
generally funds from operations adjusts the net income of equity reits for non
cash charges such as depreciation and amortization of rental properties gains
losses on sales of real estate and extraordinary items  management considers
funds from operations to be a useful financial performance measurement of an
equity reit because together with net income and cash flows funds from
operations provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the
performance of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and
other capital expenditures  funds from operations does not represent net income
or cash flows from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting
principles  gaap and is not intended to indicate whether cash flows will be
sufficient to fund cash needs  it should not be considered as an alternative to
net income as an indicator of the reits operating performance or to cash flows
as a measure of liquidity  funds from operations does not measure whether cash
flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs including principal amortization
capital improvements and distributions to shareholders  funds from operations
also does not represent cash flows generated from operating investing or
financing activities as defined under gaap  further funds from operations as
disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the companys calculation of
funds from operations  the following table sets forth the companys calculation
of funds from operations for 2000 1999 and 1998

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its
line of credit and longterm debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital
expenditures and expansion of the companys real estate investment portfolio and
operations  the companys interest rate risk management objective is to limit
the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its
overall borrowing costs  to achieve its objectives the company borrows
primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments
such as interest rate swaps caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its
interest rate risk on a related financial instrument  the company does not
enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes

the companys interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest
rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and
sensitivity to interest rate changes the company believes that the principal
amounts of the companys mortgage notes payable and line of credit approximate
fair value as of december 31 2000 as interest rates are consistent with yields
currently available to the company for similar instruments

         investments in real property create a potential for environmental
         liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property the company
         carries no express insurance coverage for this type of environmental
         risk the company has conducted environmental studies which revealed
         the presence of groundwater contamination at certain properties such
         contamination at certain of these properties was reported to have
         migrated onsite from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations the
         former industrial users of the properties were identified as the source
         of contamination the environmental studies noted that certain
         properties are located adjacent to and possibly down gradient from
         sites with known groundwater contamination the lateral limits of which
         may extend onto such properties the environmental studies also noted
         that at certain of these properties contamination existed because of
         the presence of underground fuel storage tanks which have been
         removed based on the information contained in the environmental
         studies the company believes that the costs if any it might bear as
         a result of environmental contamination or other conditions at these
         properties would not have a material adverse effect on the companys
         financial position results of operations or liquidity

         course of business and certain other legal matters in the opinion of

         adverse effect on the companys financial position results of
         operations or liquidity
