market strategy 

we operate in a media consumer and technology ecosystem that continues to evolve at a rapid pace media channels continue to fragment and clients face an increasingly complex consumer environment to stay ahead of these challenges and to achieve our objectives we have made and continue to make investments in creative strategic and technology talent in areas including fastgrowth digital marketing channels highgrowth geographic regions and strategic world markets in addition we consistently review opportunities within our company to enhance our operations through acquisitions and strategic alliances and internal programs that encourage intracompany collaboration as appropriate we also develop relationships with technology and emerging media companies that are building leadingedge marketing tools that complement our agencies skill sets and capabilities 

in recent years we have taken several major strategic steps to position our agencies as leaders in the global advertising and communications market these include 

• investment in leading talent we believe our continued ability to attract and develop top talent and to be the industry’s employer of choice for an increasingly diverse workforce have been key differentiators for ipg we continue to acquire and develop top strategic creative and digital talent from a range of backgrounds 

• growing digital capabilities our investments in talent and technology  organically growing digital capabilities such as search social user experience ux content creation analytics and mobile across the portfolio  promise to drive further growth in this dynamic sector of our business we continue to internationalize our powerful digital specialist agencies 

• datafueled offerings media and marketing is increasingly centered around the ability to manage data to create deeper direct customer relationships acxiom provides the tools to help our clients connect with individual consumers at scale kinesso furthers this vision by bringing together top data and technology talent with addressable media experts to develop software that amplifies clients marketing and leverages acxiom’s assets and capabilities 

• investments in emerging and strategic markets we strengthen our position in global markets by driving organic growth as well as completing strategic acquisitions 

• integrated marketing solutions a differentiating aspect of our business is our utilization of “open architecture” solutions that integrate the best talent from throughout the organization to fulfill the needs of our clients 

together these steps have built a culture of strategic creativity and high performance across ipg despite the challenges faced by our industry clients and workforce in 2021 we once again delivered strong growth maintaining our position as the growth leader over multiyear periods among global advertising and marketing companies this result demonstrates the continued competitiveness of our offerings the value of our longterm strategy and the strength of our culture which is especially significant during unprecedented times

datafueled offerings 

ipg has incorporated data expertise into the core of the company as reflected most clearly in our acquisition in 2018 and subsequent integration of acxiom a leading enterprise data management company understanding data and its power is critical to the current and future success of our company and our clients we believe an ethical and conscious approach to data that respects consumer privacy will continue to be crucial as we navigate increased regulation in the digital media space

diversity equity and inclusion 

ipg and our agencies are committed to diversity and inclusion and we reinforce these values through a comprehensive set of awardwinning programs these include business resource groups that develop career building programs as well as training around topics like unconscious bias we seek to ensure accountability by tying executive compensation directly to the ability of our leaders to hire promote and retain diverse talent and we regularly measure the inclusiveness of our culture with a companywide climate for inclusion survey 

we began our formal programs over a decade ago since then ipg has seen notable improvements in the diversity of our workforce and further progress is a management priority in 2020 ipg became the first advertising holding company to release race and gender composition of its leadership based on its eeo1 report and we released our updated report in 2021 we believe that an environment that encourages respect and trust is key to a creative business like ours and that a competitive advantage comes with having a variety of perspectives and beliefs in our workforce

our people 

because of the service character of our business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success and our employees including creative digital research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most valuable assets we conduct extensive employee training and development throughout our agencies and benchmark our compensation programs against those of our industry for their competitiveness and effectiveness in recruitment and retention there is keen competition for qualified employees

we employ a balanced approach in managing our human capital resources depending on where a humancapital management function is most effective or efficient processes are either managed at the holding company or designated to our operating units to adopt strategies appropriate for their client sector workforce makeup talent requirements and business demands 

the holding company retains oversight of all human capital resources and activities setting standards and providing support and policy guidance and sharing programs at the corporate center centralized human capital management processes include development of human resources governance and policy executive compensation for senior leaders across the company benefits programs succession planning focusing on the performance development and retention of the company’s seniormost executives and key roles in the operating units and executive development

impact of covid19 

in march 2020 the world health organization categorized the disease caused by the novel coronavirus covid19 as a pandemic and it continues to spread extensively throughout the united states and the rest of the world particularly in recent months with the impact of the omicron variant of the covid19 virus identified in the fourth quarter of 2021 the outbreak of covid19 and public and private sector measures to reduce its transmission such as business closures and limits on operations the adoption of social distancing measures and public and private mandates to workfromhome stayathome and shelterinplace in particular in the early months of the pandemic adversely impacted our business and demand for our services as some businesses adjusted reduced or suspended operating activities which negatively impacted the markets we serve and our results of operations cash flows and financial position throughout 2020 in 2021 despite the economic and health impacts from the spread of the delta and omicron variants of the covid19 virus we positively benefited from the effects of robust economic recovery in many of our principal markets as vaccination efforts took hold and the overall public health situation improved in many markets we continue to believe that our focus on our strategic strengths which include talent our differentiated gotomarket strategy data management capabilities and the relevance of our offerings position us well to navigate a rapidly changing marketplace the future course of the pandemic is unpredictable and the extent of its impact on our business will vary depending on the duration and severity of the continuing economic and operational impacts of covid19 the impact of the variants identified in 2021 and the pace of improvements in health and economic conditions has not been uniform across all geographies and could be threatened by such factors as the continued spread of the omicron or other variants to the covid19 virus and limitations on the effectiveness of mass vaccination and other public health efforts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic 

at the outset of the covid19 pandemic we responded swiftly in support of our people our clients and our communities to protect our employees and to do our part in stopping the spread of covid19 within days 95 percent of our global workforce had moved to a remote work environment prior to the rapid spread of the omicron variant in the fourth quarter of 2021 a significant portion of our workforce had begun to return to the office at least part of the time although much of our worldwide workforce continues to work from home we recognized the importance of regular communication to reassure employees and to keep them updated on our plans as the pandemic continues to unfold we have adopted an approach of “organized flexibility” and continue to adjust our policies and practices to facilitate the new working environments and take into account the need of many employees to work during nontraditional hours and juggle home lives and work responsibilities 

we believe we have had significant success in maintaining and continuing to advance the quality of our services notwithstanding extensive changes required by the pandemic with respect to managing costs we undertook multiple initiatives to align our expenses with changes in revenue the steps we took in 2020 across our agencies and corporate group included deferred merit increases freezes on hiring and temporary labor major cuts in nonessential spending staff reductions and furloughs and salary reductions including voluntary salary reductions for our senior corporate management team these actions were discontinued in 2021 as revenue growth returned 

in 2020 the company also took restructuring actions to lower our operating expenses structurally and permanently relative to revenue and to accelerate the transformation of our business most of these actions were based on our experience and learning in the covid19 pandemic and a resulting review of our operations notably we foresee a greater role for workfromhome in a hybrid officehome model to deliver and support our services in a postcovid world 

we discuss these restructuring actions as well as steps to strengthen our financial position that we undertook in 2020 in more detail in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” 

financial objectives 

our financial goals include competitive organic net revenue growth and expansion of adjusted ebita margin as defined and discussed within the nongaap financial measure section of the mda which we expect will further strengthen our balance sheet and total liquidity and increase value to our shareholders accordingly we remain focused on meeting the evolving needs of our clients while concurrently managing our cost structure our disciplined approach to our balance sheet and liquidity provides us with a solid financial foundation and financial flexibility to manage and grow our business we believe that our strategy and execution position us to meet our financial goals and to deliver longterm value to all of our shareholders 

financial reporting segments 

we have two reportable segments which are integrated agency networks “ian” and ipg dxtra ian is comprised of mccann worldgroup fcb mullenlowe group media data services and tech which includes mediabrands acxiom kinesso and matterkind our digital specialist agencies and our domestic integrated agencies ipg dxtra is comprised of a number of our specialist marketing services offerings in public relations sports and experiential marketing and branding we also report results for the “corporate and other” group see note 15 in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for further information 

effective january 1 2022 the company completed a managerial and operational review and has undertaken several organizational initiatives as a result of these modifications we will be changing our reportable segments beginning with our form 10q filing for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to include three reportable segments prior period segment information will be recast to reflect our new reportable segments our new reportable segment disclosures will reflect our revised organizational alignment as well as the manner in which we will manage our business 

sources of revenue 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world our revenues are directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients and our ability to win new clients most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 30 to 90 days although our data management contracts typically have noncancelable terms of more than one year 

revenues for the creation and production of advertising or the planning and placement of media are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided 

we also generate revenue from data and technology offerings and in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion experiential marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients as is customary in the advertising and marketing industries to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients and in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor in these arrangements 

our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter 



clients 

our large and diverse client base includes many of the most recognizable companies and brands throughout the world our holding company structure allows us to maintain a diversified client base across and within a full range of industry sectors in the aggregate our top ten clients based on net revenue accounted for approximately 20 of net revenue in 2021 and 20 in 2020 our largest client accounted for approximately 4 and 3 of net revenue in 2021 and 2020 respectively based on net revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 our largest client sectors in alphabetical order were financial services healthcare and technology and telecom we represent several different clients brands or divisions within each of these sectors in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency brands representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency and a client may change its marketing budget at any time 

we operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry our operating companies compete against other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies and new forms of market participants to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships

 item 1a risk factors tableend

we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition see also statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure 

risks related to the global market and the economy 

• the continuing impact of the covid19 pandemic is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted and may adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

the continuing global reach of covid19 including the emergence of new variants of the virus has created significant worldwide operational volatility uncertainty and disruption the covid19 pandemic adversely impacted our business financial condition and results of operations particularly in the early months of the pandemic and the extent of the continuing impact will depend on numerous evolving factors which are highly uncertain rapidly changing and unpredictable including 

• the duration severity and scope of the pandemic including as new variants emerge and spread 

• governmental business and individual actions that may be taken in response to the outbreak including travel restrictions quarantines social distancing workathome and stayathome mandates and business shutdowns 

• the effectiveness and timing of covid19 vaccination campaigns or any perceived limitations of or setbacks in these efforts 

• the impact of the pandemic on the financial markets and economic activity generally 

• the impact of the pandemic on labor costs and supply 

• the effect of the pandemic on our clients and other business partners including the impact of supplychain disruptions 

• our ability to access usual sources of liquidity on reasonable terms 

• our ability to achieve the full benefits of the restructuring actions we took in 2020 and other costsaving initiatives 

• our ability during the pandemic to provide our services including those related to the health and wellbeing of our employees and 

• the ability of our clients to pay for our services during and following the pandemic if significant disruptions develop or continue 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly increased financial and economic volatility and uncertainty resulting downturns in the economy have had and we expect will continue to have a negative impact on many of our clients some clients particularly in the early months of the pandemic responded to weak or volatile economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets thereby decreasing the market and demand for our services in addition many businesses adjusted reduced or suspended operating activities which negatively impacted certain of the markets or industries we serve these patterns may recur in future periods including as a result of pandemic developments such as the emergence of new virus variants that may be more transmissible virulent or both all of the foregoing has impacted and will likely continue to impact our business financial condition results of operations and forwardlooking expectations 

furthermore modified processes procedures and controls have been required to respond to the changes in our business environment as the majority of our employees have continued to work from home the significant increase in remote working of our employees may exacerbate certain risks to our business including the increased demand for information technology resources increased risk of malicious technologyrelated events such as cyberattacks and phishing attacks and increased risk of improper dissemination of personal proprietary or confidential information 

the potential effects of covid19 could also heighten the risks disclosed in many of our other risk factors that are included below including as a result of but not limited to the factors listed above 

• our results of operations are highly susceptible to unfavorable economic conditions 

we are exposed to risks associated with weak or uncertain regional or global economic conditions and disruption in the financial markets following the severe downturn in most markets following the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic the global economy continues to be challenging the recent emergence and spread of the omicron variant of the covid19 coronavirus has negatively impacted economic growth prospects over upcoming periods economic downturns or uncertainty about the strength of the global economy generally or economic conditions in certain regions or market sectors and caution on the part of marketers can have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services in addition 

market conditions can be and have been adversely affected by natural and human disruptions such as natural disasters public health crises severe weather events military conflict or civil unrest our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general in the past including in connection with the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses this pattern may recur in the future furthermore unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions or other market disruptions that adversely affect client spending the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations 

risks related to our industry and operations 

• we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive and constantly changing our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and other providers of creative marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants 

competitive challenges also arise from rapidlyevolving and new technologies in the marketing and advertising space creating opportunities for new and existing competitors and a need for continued significant investment in tools technologies and process improvements as datadriven marketing solutions become increasingly core to the success of our brands any failure to keep up with rapidly changing technologies and standards in this space could harm our competitive position 

the client’s perception of the quality of our agencies’ creative work its confidence in our ability to protect the confidentiality of their and their customers’ data and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services and technologies may also be an important competitive consideration on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people and freedom of entry into the industry is almost unlimited our relationships with clients can be affected by the departure of key personnel and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

• clients may terminate or reduce their relationships with us on short notice 

many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time and we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions our clients may choose to terminate their contracts or reduce their relationships with us on a relatively short time frame and for any reason a relatively small number of clients contribute a significant portion of our revenue in the aggregate our top ten clients based on net revenue accounted for approximately 20 of net revenue in 2021 a substantial decline in a large client’s advertising and marketing spending or the loss of a significant part of its business could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 

our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest or our own exclusivity arrangements with certain clients these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

• we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel 

our employees including creative digital research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most valuable assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and factors which may be beyond our control the covid19 pandemic has been characterized by an increase in labor costs disruptions and turnover changes to us or other immigration policies or travel restrictions imposed as a result of public health political or security concerns that restrain the flow of professional talent may inhibit our ability to staff our offices or projects in addition the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility and significant use of thirdparty or temporary workers to staff new growing or temporary assignments if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients or fail to manage our workforce effectively our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

• if our clients experience financial distress or seek to change or delay payment terms it could negatively affect our own financial position and results 

we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business unfavorable economic and financial conditions such as those 

resulting from the covid19 pandemic could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and writeoffs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients and if these effects were severe the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity 

furthermore in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities to the extent possible we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients however if clients are unable to pay for commitments that we have entered into on their behalf or if clients seek to significantly delay or otherwise alter payment terms there could be an adverse effect on our working capital which would negatively impact our operating cash flow 

• international business risks could adversely affect our operations 

we are a global business with agencies operating in over 100 countries including every significant world market operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our net revenues approximately 35 in 2021 these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation currency variation exchange control restrictions local labor and employment laws that hinder workforce flexibility largescale local or regional public health crises and other difficult social political or economic conditions we also must comply with applicable us local and other international anticorruption laws including the fcpa and the uk antibribery act 2010 which can be comprehensive complex and stringent in all jurisdictions where we operate certain of which present heightened compliance challenges export controls and economic sanctions such as those maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury can impose limitations on our ability to operate in certain geographic regions or to seek or service certain potential clients these restrictions can place us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to those competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions failure to comply or to implement business practices that sufficiently prevent corruption or violation of sanctions laws could result in significant remediation expense and expose us to significant civil and criminal penalties and reputational harm 

in addition in developing countries or regions we may face further risks such as slower receipt of payments nationalization social and economic instability currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries 

• we are subject to industry regulations and other legal or reputational risks that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our performance or financial condition 

our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation regulation judicial actions or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare our business is also subject to specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products 

existing and proposed laws and regulations in particular in the european union the united kingdom and the united states concerning user privacy use and protection of personal information and online tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internetbased digital and targeted marketing we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern whether and how we can transfer process or receive certain data that we use in our operations the european union for example has recently tightened its rules on the transferability of data to the united states collection processing and storage of biometric identifiers has come under increasing regulation and is the subject of class action litigation the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may increase in the future as a result of the implementation of new laws or regulations such as the gdpr and the ccpacpra or changes in interpretations of current ones such as the interpretation of existing consumer protection laws as imposing restrictions on the online collection storage and use of personal data any failure on our part to comply with these legal requirements or their application in an unanticipated manner could harm our business and result in significant penalties or legal liability 

the imposition of restrictions on certain technologies by private market participants in response to privacy concerns could also have a negative impact on our digital business if we are unable to transfer data between countries and regions in which we operate or if we are prohibited from sharing data among our products and services it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results 

legislators agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products such as alcohol tobacco or marijuana products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients’ goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently on our revenues or results governmental action including judicial rulings on the relative responsibilities of 

clients and their marketing agencies for the content of their marketing can also impact our operations furthermore we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial in poor taste or not conforming to contemporary social standards 

• we rely extensively on information technology systems and could face cybersecurity risks 

we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business including the digital storage of marketing strategies and client information develop new business opportunities and digital products and process business transactions our business operations depend on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and sensitive information over the internet and through interconnected systems the incidence of malicious technologyrelated events such as cyberattacks computer hacking computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software phishing attacks and other attempts to gain access to confidential or personal data denial of service or ransomware attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide and highlights the need for continual and effective cybersecurity awareness and education we our clients and our vendors are increasingly the target of hackers and other threat actors denial of service attacks and malicious code which can result in the unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential and sensitive data unavailability of services and supply chain disruptions or other adverse events 

our business which increasingly involves the collection use and transmission of customer data may make us and our agencies attractive targets for malicious thirdparty attempts to access this data power outages equipment failure natural disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information we utilize inhouse and thirdparty services including thirdparty “cloud” computing services to perform key operational functions including the storage transfer or processing of data system failures or network disruptions or breaches in such inhouse or thirdparty systems could adversely affect our reputation or business we maintain and we require our thirdparty service providers to maintain security controls designed to ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems and the confidential and sensitive information we maintain and process despite our best efforts however the threat landscape is constantly evolving a cybersecurity incident or data breach affecting the confidentiality integrity or availability of the information we process our data systems or those operated on our behalf by thirdparty service providers could adversely affect our ability to manage our risk exposure and could significantly harm our business we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis with a large number of agencies and legal entities and the resulting size diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase our potential vulnerability to such breakdowns malicious intrusions or attacks 

data privacy or cybersecurity breaches as well as improper use of social media by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data such as personally identifiable information strategic plans and trade secrets could be exposed to third parties or to the general public any such breaches or breakdowns could result in a loss of our or our clients’ or vendors’ proprietary information expose us to legal liability and be expensive to remedy we consider the ethical treatment of data to be a business strength and the damage to our reputation and business from any such breach could be significant and costly efforts to develop implement and maintain security measures are costly may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and cyberattack techniques change frequently or are not recognized until successful and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated we operate worldwide and the legal rules governing data transfers are often complex conflicting unclear or everchanging increased privacy and cybersecurity requirements may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our business 

• we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments 

we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients such as our acquisition of acxiom in 2018 these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment our customary business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity our forecasts of the investment’s future performance also factor into the initial consideration when actual financial results differ our returns on the investment could be adversely affected 

we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees businesses assets or systems into our organization including with respect to our internal policies and required controls we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investments operations furthermore it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all talent is among our most valuable assets and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel acquisition and integration activity may also divert management’s attention and other corporate resources from other business needs if we fail to realize the intended advantages of 

any given investment or acquisition or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

• the costs of compliance with sustainability or other environmental social responsibility or governance esg laws regulations or policies including investor and clientdriven policies and standards could adversely affect our business 

while as a non–location–specific non–manufacturing service business we have to date been sheltered from or able to mitigate many direct impacts from climate change and related laws and regulations we are nevertheless increasingly impacted by the effects of climate change and laws and regulations related to other esg concerns we could also incur related costs indirectly through our clients or investors increasingly our clients request that we comply with their own social responsibility sustainability or other business policies or standards which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations before they commence or continue doing business with us and esg issues are increasingly a focus of the investor community in 2021 we committed to certain sciencebased emissions targets the sourcing of 100 of our electricity needs from renewable sources by 2030 and the realization of netzero carbon emissions by 2040 some clients and investors may request that we commit to emissions targets and timeframes that may be more aggressive than the commitments we have already undertaken any setbacks in the feasibility or timing of the achievement of our commitments could result in reputational harm or damaged relationships with clients or consumers the financial and operational costs of complying with esg laws and regulations or achieving our esg goals and related certification requirements could grow significantly in future years if large shareholders were to reduce their ownership stakes in our company as a result of dissatisfaction with our policies or efforts in this area there could be negative impact on our stock price and we could also suffer reputational harm further if clients’ costs are adversely affected by climate change or related laws and regulations this could negatively impact their spending on our advertising and marketing services we could also face increased prices from our own suppliers that face climate changerelated and other esg costs and seek to pass on their increased costs to their customers 

risks related to our financial condition and results 

• our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient 

agency operating cash flows have a significant impact on our liquidity and we maintain a commercial paper program a committed corporate credit facility and uncommitted lines of credit to increase flexibility in support of our operating needs if any of these sources were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity and ability to adequately fund our operations could be adversely affected and we could be required to refinance restructure or otherwise amend some or all of our obligations sell assets or raise additional cash in the capital markets and there could be a negative impact on our credit ratings we cannot assure you that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity including in the capital markets on commercially reasonable terms or at all or if accomplished that we would raise sufficient funds to meet our needs 

under our commercial paper program we are authorized to issue shortterm debt up to an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 15 billion which we use for working capital and general corporate purposes borrowings under the commercial paper program are supported by our 15 billion committed corporate credit facility the “credit agreement” if credit under the credit agreement or our ability to access the commercial paper market were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity could be adversely affected 

the credit agreement contains a leverage ratio and other nonfinancial covenants and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them for example compliance with the financial covenant would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience increased indebtedness or substantially lower revenues including as a result of economic downturns client losses or a substantial increase in client defaults if we were unable to comply with any of the covenants contained in the credit agreement we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders and our costs under these agreements could increase if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver the credit agreement could be terminated any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration and we could lose access to certain uncommitted financing arrangements and commercial paper 

for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook see liquidity and capital resources in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

• downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us 

because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness including covenants and interest rates we could be adversely affected if our credit ratings were downgraded or if they were significantly weaker than those of our competitors our access to the commercial paper market is contingent on our maintenance of sufficient shortterm debt ratings and any downgrades to those ratings could increase our borrowing costs and reduce the market capacity for or our ability to issue commercial paper our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

• our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances 

we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets fixed assets and operating lease rightofuse assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance 

as of december 31 2021 we had substantial amounts of longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet including approximately 49 billion of goodwill future events including our financial performance market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies loss of a significant client’s business or strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets as well as our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets see critical accounting estimates in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

• our financial results are exposed to exchange rate risk 

because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the argentine peso brazilian real japanese yen and columbian peso fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies may adversely affect our financial results 

• we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones 

from time to time we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them see statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure

impact of covid19 

in march 2020 the world health organization categorized the disease caused by the novel coronavirus covid19 as a pandemic and it continues to spread extensively throughout the united states and the rest of the world particularly in recent months with the impact of the omicron variant of the covid19 virus identified in the fourth quarter of 2021 the outbreak of covid19 and public and private sector measures to reduce its transmission such as business closures and limits on operations the adoption of social distancing measures and public and private mandates to work from home stay at home and shelter in place in particular in the early months of the pandemic adversely impacted our business and demand for our services as some businesses adjusted reduced or suspended operating activities which negatively impacted the markets we serve and our results of operations cash flows and financial position throughout 2020 in 2021 despite the economic and health impacts from the spread of the delta and omicron variants of the covid19 virus we positively benefited from the effects of robust economic recovery in many of our principal markets as vaccination efforts took hold and the overall public health situation improved in many markets we continue to believe that our focus on our strategic strengths which include talent our differentiated gotomarket strategy data management capabilities and the relevance of our offerings position us well to navigate a rapidly changing marketplace the future course of the pandemic is unpredictable and the extent of its impact on our business will vary depending on the duration and severity of the continuing economic and operational impacts of covid19 the impact of the variants identified in 2021 and the pace of improvements in health and economic conditions has not been uniform across all geographies and could be threatened by such factors as the continued spread of the omicron or other variants to the covid19 virus and limitations on the effectiveness of mass vaccination and other public health efforts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic 

at the outset of the covid19 pandemic we responded swiftly in support of our people our clients and our communities to protect our employees and to do our part in stopping the spread of covid19 within days 95 percent of our global workforce had moved to a remote work environment prior to the rapid spread of the omicron variant in the fourth quarter of 2021 a significant portion of our workforce had begun to return to the office at least part of the time although much of our worldwide workforce continues to work from home we recognized the importance of regular communication to reassure employees and to keep them updated on our plans as the pandemic continues to unfold we have adopted an approach of “organized flexibility” and continue to adjust our policies and practices to facilitate the new working environments and take into account the need of many employees to work during nontraditional hours and juggle home lives and work responsibilities 

we believe we have had significant success in maintaining and continuing to advance the quality of our services notwithstanding extensive changes required by the pandemic with respect to managing costs we undertook multiple initiatives to align our expenses with changes in revenue the steps we took in 2020 across our agencies and corporate group included deferred merit increases freezes on hiring and temporary labor major cuts in nonessential spending staff reductions and furloughs and salary reductions including voluntary salary reductions for our senior corporate management team these actions were discontinued in 2021 as revenue growth returned 

in 2020 the company also took restructuring actions to lower our operating expenses structurally and permanently relative to revenue and to accelerate the transformation of our business the “2020 plan” most of these actions were based on our experience and learning in the covid19 pandemic and a resulting review of our operations notably we foresee a greater role for workfromhome in a hybrid officehome model to deliver and support our services in a postcovid world 

despite the economic effects of covid19 in 2021 we experienced robust growth throughout the year driven in our domestic market by growth across all disciplines most notably in our advertising and media businesses and in our international markets by doubledigit organic growth in all geographic regions bolstered by strong performance at our media and advertising businesses in addition to our digital projectbased offerings the emergence and rapid spread of the omicron variant in the fourth quarter of 2021 did not have a significant negative impact on our growth in that quarter though covid19 clouds the economic outlook for the first half of 2022 prospects for continuing general economic recovery and improved financial performance as the year progresses will depend on the course of the pandemic and the efficacy of vaccination and other public health efforts both domestically and globally other macroeconomic risks to our performance in 2022 includes the extent of inflation of labor costs and potential for labor shortages inflationary pressures on our clients and their customers and the impact of continuing and unpredictable supply chain disruptions across the global economy see item 1a risk factors  in this annual report on form 10k 

in 2021 we took further steps to strengthen our financial position during this period of continued uncertainty as discussed in more detail in note 4 in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  on february 25 2021 we issued 5000 aggregate principal amount of 2400 senior unsecured notes due 2031 the “2400 senior notes” and 5000 aggregate principal amount of 3375 senior unsecured notes due 2041 the “3375 senior notes” we applied the net proceeds of

these offerings towards the redemption in march 2021 of all 2500 in aggregate principal amount of our 4000 unsecured senior notes due 2022 the 4000 senior notes all 5000 in aggregate principal amount of our 3750 unsecured senior notes due 2023 the 3750 senior notes and 2500 of the 5000 in aggregate principal amount of the 4200 unsecured senior notes due 2024 the 4200 senior notes we also used cash on hand to fund the repayment on maturity on october 1 2021 of all 5000 aggregate principal amount of our 3750 unsecured senior notes due 2021 as a result of these steps the remaining 2500 aggregate principal amount of the 4200 senior notes is the only senior debt we have outstanding that matures before 2028 

our financial information 

when we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the remainder we call organic change which indicates how our underlying business performed we exclude the impact of billable expenses in analyzing our operating performance as the fluctuations from period to period are not indicative of the performance of our underlying businesses and have no impact on our operating income or net income 

the change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the priorperiod reported results using the currentperiod exchange rates and comparing these priorperiod adjusted amounts to the priorperiod reported results although the us dollar is our reporting currency a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies therefore our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar affect our consolidated results of operations and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact to our operations related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region the foreign currencies that most favorably impacted our results during the year ended december 31 2021 were the british pound sterling the euro australian dollar and canadian dollar the foreign currencies that most adversely impacted our results during the year ended december 31 2021 were the brazilian real and argentine peso 

for purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred during the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan 

the metrics that we use to evaluate our financial performance include organic change in net revenue as well as the change in certain operating expenses and the components thereof expressed as a percentage of consolidated net revenue as well as adjusted ebita these metrics are also used by management to assess the financial performance of our reportable segments integrated agency networks ian and ipg dxtra dxtra in certain of our discussions we analyze net revenue by geographic region and by business sector in which we focus on our top 500 clients which typically constitute approximately 80 to 85 of our annual consolidated net revenues 

the consolidated financial statements and mda presented herein reflect the latest estimates and assumptions made by us that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods presented we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to assess the fair values of the company’s goodwill longlived assets and indefinitelived intangible assets assessment of the annual effective tax rate valuation of deferred income taxes and the allowance for expected credit losses on future uncollectible accounts receivable if actual market conditions vary significantly from those currently projected these estimates and assumptions could materially change resulting in adjustments to the carrying values of our assets and liabilities

our organic net revenue increase of 119 for the year ended december 31 2021 was driven by net higher spending from existing clients across all sectors most notably in the healthcare retail auto and transportation and technology and telecom sectors which also each increased from net client wins during the year ended december 31 2021 our adjusted ebita margin on net revenue increa sed to 167 from 84 in the prioryear period as the increase in net revenue discussed below in the “results of operations” section outpaced the overall increase in our operating expenses excluding billable expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles 

our organic net revenue decrease of 48 fo r the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on advertising marketing and media spending in the auto and transportation technology and telecom consumer goods and financial services sectors partially offset by a combination of net client wins and net higher spending from existing clients in the healthcare and retail sectors during the year ended december 31 2020 our adjusted ebita margin on net revenue decreased to 84 from 136 in the prioryear period the decrease was primarily due to restructuring charges

net revenue 

our net revenue is directly impacted by the retention and spending levels of existing clients and by our ability to win new clients most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue our net revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter reflecting the seasonal spending of our clients 



the organic increase in our domestic market was primarily driven by growth across all disciplines most notably in our advertising media public relations and events and sports marketing businesses in our international markets the organic increase was primarily driven by strong performance at our media and advertising businesses and our digital projectbased offerings across all geographic regions 



the organic decrease in our domestic market was primarily due to the impact of the pandemic on the economy at our sports and experiential marketing businesses primarily due to sports and other event cancellations and on our discretionary digital projectbased offerings the decreases were partially offset by growth at our advertising and media businesses in our international markets the organic decrease was primarily driven by the revenue declines at our advertising and sports and experiential marketing businesses and public relations agencies primarily in the asia pacific and united kingdom regions as well as the revenue declines at our media businesses primarily in the continental europe and asia pacific regions

salaries and related expenses 



net revenue growth of 129 outpaced the increase in salaries and related expenses of 118 d uring the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the prioryear period the ratio improvement was primarily driven by leverage in base salaries benefits and tax that includes the benefit of initiatives taken during 2020 as well as lower severance expense partially offset by increased performancebased employee incentive compensation expense as a result of strong operating performance and increased temporary help expense 

salaries and related expenses decreased by 40 compared to our net revenue decline of 65 during the year e nded december 31 2020 as compared to the prioryear period the decrease in salaries and related expenses was primarily driven by reductions in base salaries benefits and tax and lower incentive and temporary help expenses in response to the decline in net revenue which was primarily due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on economic conditions the overall decreases were partially offset by increased severance expense

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow overview 

the following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity capital resources and uses of capital 





1 reflects net income adjusted primarily for depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangible assets loss on early extinguishment of debt amortization of restricted stock and other noncash compensation net losses on sales of businesses and provision for uncollectible receivables 

2 reflects changes in accounts receivable other current assets accounts payable accrued liabilities and contract liabilities   

operating activities 

due to the seasonality of our business we typically use cash from working capital in the first nine months of a year with the largest impact in the first quarter and generate cash from working capital in the fourth quarter driven by the seasonally strong media spending by our clients quarterly and annual working capital results are impacted by the fluctuating annual media spending budgets of our clients as well as their changing media spending patterns throughout each year across various countries 

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients across various countries affects our working capital and operating cash flow and can be volatile in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients the amounts involved which substantially exceed our revenues primarily affect the level of accounts receivable accounts payable accrued liabilities and contract liabilities our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments for example while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2021 was 20756 which was an increase of 2284 as compared to 2020 this increase was primarily driven by an increase in our net income of 6186 this comparison includes 7434 generated from working capital in 2021 compared with 9001 generated from working capital in 2020 working capital in 2021 was primarily impacted by the variation in the timing of collections and payments around the reporting period 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2020 was 18472 which was an increase of 3180 as compared to 2019 and the comparison includes 9001 generated from working capital in 2020 compared with 4428 used in working capital in 2019 working capital in 2020 was primarily impacted by the variation in the timing of collections and payments around the reporting period which was favorable in 2020 compared to 2019 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during 2021 consisted primarily of payments for capital expenditures of 1953 related mostly to computer software leasehold improvements and computer hardware 

net cash used in investing activities during 2020 consisted primarily of payments for capital expenditures of 1675 related mostly to computer hardware computer software and leasehold improvements 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during 2021 was driven by payment for the early extinguishment of longterm debt of 10668 in the first quarter of 2021 repayment of our 5000 3750 senior notes that matured on october 1 2021 and the payment of common stock dividends of 4277 partially offset by net proceeds of 9981 from the issuance of 5000 of our 2400 senior notes and 5000 of our 3375 senior notes in the first quarter of 2021 see note 4 in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information

foreign exchange rate changes 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a net decrease of 454 in 2021 this decrease was primarily a result of the us dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies including the euro the australian dollar and the mexican peso 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a net increase of 310 in 2020 

liquidity outlook 

we expect our cash flow from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months we also have a commercial paper program a committed corporate credit facility and uncommitted lines of credit to support our operating needs borrowings under our commercial paper program are supported by our committed corporate credit agreement we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity with flexibility over significant uses of cash including our capital expenditures cash used for new acquisitions our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends 

from time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional funds or otherwise improve our liquidity profile enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors which include those specific to us such as our credit ratings and those related to the financial markets such as the amount or terms of available credit there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity or continue to access existing sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

funding requirements 

our most significant funding requirements include our operations noncancelable operating lease obligations capital expenditures acquisitions common stock dividends taxes and debt service additionally we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests

• acquisitions – we paid deferred payments of 671 for prior acquisitions as well as ownership increases in our consolidated subsidiaries in addition to potential cash expenditures for new acquisitions we expect to pay approximately 150 over the next twelve months related to all completed acquisitions as of december 31 2021  we may also be required to pay approximately 40 related to put options held by minority shareholders if exercised over the next twelve months we will continue to ev aluate strategic opportunities to grow and continue to strengthen our market position particularly in our digital and marketing services offerings and to expand our presence in highgrowth and key strategic world markets 

• dividends – during 2021 we paid four quarterly cash dividends of 0270 per share on our common stock which corresponded to aggregate dividend payments of 4277 on february 10 2022 we announced that our board of directors the board had declared a common stock cash dividend of 0290 per share payable on march 15 2022 to holders of record as of the close of business on march 1 2022 assuming we pay a quarterly dividend of 0290 per share and there is no significant change in the number of outstanding shares as of december 31 2021 we would expect to pay approximately 4570 over the next twelve months whether to declare and the amount of any such future dividend is at the discretion of our board and will depend upon factors such as our earnings financial position and cash requirements 

• restructuring – all restructuring charges were identified and initiated in 2020 restructuring charges of 106 during the year ended december 31 2021 are adjustments to the actions taken in 2020 as of december 31 2021 our remaining liability related to restructuring actions was 94 

the following summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations and commitments as of december 31 2021 and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 





1 amounts represent maturity at book value and interest payments based on contractual obligations we may at our option and at any time redeem all or some of any outstanding series of our senior notes reflected in this table at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable supplemental indentures under which such senior notes were issued see note 4 in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information

share repurchase program 

on july 2 2018 in connection with the announcement of the acxiom acquisition we announced that share repurchases would be suspended for a period of time in order to reduce the increased debt levels incurred in conjunction with the acquisition as of december 31 2021 3384 excluding fees remained available for repurchase under the share repurchase programs authorized in previous years 

on february 10 2022 our board of directors the board reauthorized a program to repurchase from time to time up to 4000 of our common stock we may effect such repurchases through open market purchases trading plans established in accordance with us securities and exchange commission sec rules derivative transactions or other means we expect to

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

continue to repurchase our common stock in future periods although the timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements this authorization has no expiration date 

financing and sources of funds 

substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world including at the holding company level below is a summary of our sources of liquidity 

at december 31 2021 we held 7366 of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in foreign subsidiaries the company has historically asserted that its unremitted foreign earnings are permanently reinvested and therefore has not recorded any deferred taxes on such amounts however as of december 31 2021 812 of undistributed foreign earnings from certain international entities were not subject to the permanent reinvestment assertion therefore the company has recorded deferred taxes on this amount 

credit arrangements 

we maintain a committed corporate credit facility originally dated as of july 18 2008 which has been amended and restated from time to time the credit agreement we use our credit agreement to increase our financial flexibility to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries and to support our commercial paper program on november 1 2021 we amended and restated the credit agreement as amended among other things the maturity date of the credit agreement was extended to november 1 2026 and the cost structure of the credit agreement was changed the credit agreement continues to include a required leverage ratio of not more than 350 to 100 among other customary covenants including limitations on our liens and the liens of our consolidated subsidiaries and limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary debt at the election of the company the leverage ratio may be changed to not more than 400 to 100 for four consecutive quarters beginning with the fiscal quarter in which there is an occurrence of one or more acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of at least 2000 

the credit agreement is a revolving facility under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 15000 or the equivalent in other currencies the company has the ability to increase the commitments under the credit agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to 2500 provided the company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase subject to a sublimit of 500 or the equivalent in other currencies our obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured as of december 31 2021 there were no borrowings under the credit agreement however we had 107 of letters of credit under the credit agreement which reduced our total availability to 14893 

on march 27 2020 we entered into an agreement for a 364day revolving credit facility the 364day credit facility that matured on march 26 2021 the 364day credit facility was a revolving facility under which amounts borrowed by us may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 5000 the 364day credit facility also contained a financial covenant that required us to maintain on a consolidated basis as of the end of each fiscal quarter a leverage ratio for the four quarters then ended the leverage ratio and other covenants set forth in the 364day credit facility were equivalent to the covenants contained in the companys existing credit agreement 

on july 28 2020 we entered into amendment no 1 to the credit agreement and amendment no 1 to the 364day credit facility together the “amendments” the amendments increased the maximum leverage ratio covenant to 425x in the case of the 364day credit facility and in the case of the credit agreement to i 425x through the quarter ended june 30 2021 and ii 350x thereafter the effective period of the amendments expired on june 30 2021 

we were in compliance with all of our covenants in the credit agreement as of december 31 2021 the financial covenant in the credit agreement requires that we maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a certain leverage ratio for the four quarters then ended

the table below sets forth the financial covenant in effect as of december 31 2021 





1 the leverage ratio is defined as debt as of the last day of such fiscal quarter to ebitda as defined in the credit agreement for the four quarters then ended 

2 includes adjustments of the following items from our consolidated statement of operations in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  provision for income taxes total expenses and other income equity in net income loss of unconsolidated affiliates and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  

uncommitted lines of credit 

we also have uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates and that are primarily used to fund working capital needs we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some of our operations as of december 31 2021 the company had uncommitted lines of credit in an aggregate amount of 8462 under which we had outstanding borrowings of 475 classified as shortterm borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet the average amount outstanding during 2021 was 602 with a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 34 

commercial paper 

the company is authorized to issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 15000 borrowings under the commercial paper program are supported by the credit agreement described above proceeds of the commercial paper are used for working capital and general corporate purposes including the repayment of maturing indebtedness and other shortterm liquidity needs the maturities of the commercial paper vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue there was no commercial paper activity during 2021 and as of december 31 2021 there was no commercial paper outstanding 

cash pooling 

we aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the united states we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several ipg agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all agencies does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of bank overdrafts under all of our pooling arrangements and as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the amounts netted were 27747 and 27022 respectively 

debt credit ratings 

our debt credit ratings as of february 15 2022 are listed below 



a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity either adverse or favorable because among other things they 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise for example our credit agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid and our access to the commercial paper market is contingent on our maintenance of sufficient shortterm debt ratings 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our consolidated financial statements management has discussed with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising and communications marketing services including public relations meeting and event production sports and entertainment marketing corporate and brand identity strategic marketing consulting and providing marketing data and technology services around the world 

most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the basis on which we earn fees and commissions vary significantly our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 30 to 90 days although our data management contracts typically have noncancelable terms of more than one year our payment terms vary by client and the time between invoicing date and due date is typically not significant we generally have the legally enforceable right to payment for all services provided through the end of the contract or termination date 

we recognize revenue when we determine our customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services to determine revenue recognition we perform the following five steps i identify the contracts with a customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue as or when we satisfy the performance obligation we only apply the fivestep model to contracts when it is probable that ipg will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer at contract inception we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are distinct performance obligations we then assess whether we act as an agent or a principal for each identified performance obligation and include revenue within the transaction price for thirdparty costs when we determine that we act as principal 

net revenue primarily consisting of fees commissions and performance incentives represents the amount of our gross billings excluding billable expenses charged to a client generally our compensation is based on a negotiated fixed price rate per hour a retainer commission or volume the majority of our fees are recognized over time as services are performed either utilizing a function of hours incurred and rates per hour as compared to periodically updated estimates to complete or ratably over the term of the contract for certain lessfrequent commissionbased contracts which contain clauses allowing our clients to terminate the arrangement at any time for no compensation revenue is recognized at a point in time typically the date of broadcast or publication 

contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to mutually agreedupon qualitative andor quantitative metrics performance incentives are treated as variable consideration which is estimated at contract inception and included in revenue based on the most likely amount earned out of a range of potential outcomes our estimates are based on a combination of historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment these estimates are updated on a periodic basis and are not expected to result in a reversal of a significant amount of the cumulative revenue recognized 

the predominant component of billable expenses are thirdparty vendor costs incurred for performance obligations where we have determined that we are acting as principal these thirdparty expenses are generally billed back to our clients billable expenses also includes incidental costs incurred in the performance of our services including airfare mileage hotel stays out 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

oftown meals and telecommunication charges we record these billable expenses within total revenue with a corresponding offset to operating expenses 

in international markets we may receive rebates or credits from vendors based on transactions entered into on behalf of clients rebates and credits are remitted back to our clients in accordance with our contractual requirements or may be retained by us based on the terms of a particular client contract and local law amounts owed back to clients are recorded as a liability and amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned 

in certain international markets our media contracts may allow clients to terminate our arrangement at any time for no compensation to the extent that media has not yet run for those contracts we do not recognize revenue until the media runs which is the point in time at which we have a legally enforceable right to compensation 

performance obligations 

our client contracts may include various goods and services that are capable of being distinct are distinct within the context of the contract and are therefore accounted for as separate performance obligations we allocate revenue to each performance obligation in the contract at inception based on its relative standalone selling price 

our advertising businesses include a wide range of services that involve the creation of an advertising idea concept campaign or marketing strategy in order to promote the client’s brand creative services and to act as an agent to facilitate the production of advertisements by thirdparty suppliers production services” our clients can contract us to perform one or both of these services as they can derive standalone benefits from each production services can include formatting creative material for different media and communication mediums including digital largescale reproduction such as printing and adaptation services talent engagement and acquisition television and radio production and outdoor billboard production our contracts that include both services are typically explicit in the description of which activities constitute the creative advertising services and those that constitute the production services both the creative and production services are sold separately the client can derive utility from each service on its own we do not provide a significant service of integrating these activities into a bundle the services do not significantly modify one another and the services are not highly interrelated or interdependent as such we typically identify two performance obligations in the assessment of our advertising contracts 

our media businesses include services to formulate strategic media plans media planning services and to act as an agent to purchase media eg television and radio spots outdoor advertising digital banners etc from vendors on our clients behalf media buying services our contracts that include both services are typically explicit in the description of which activities constitute the planning services and those that constitute the buying services both the planning and buying services are sold separately the client can derive utility from each service on its own we do not provide a significant service of integrating these activities into a bundle the services do not significantly modify one another and the services are not highly interrelated or interdependent as such we typically identify two performance obligations in the assessment of our media contracts 

our events businesses include creative services related to the conception and planning of custom marketing events as well as activation services which entail the carrying out of the event including but not limited to setup design and staffing additionally our public relations businesses include a broad range of services such as strategic planning social media strategy and the monitoring and development of communication strategies among others while our contracts in these businesses may include some or all of these services we typically identify only one performance obligation in the assessment of our events and public relations contracts as we provide a significant service of integrating the individual services into a combined service for which the customer has contracted 

our data and technology services businesses include data management data and data strategy identity resolution and measurement and analytics products and services while our contracts in these businesses may include some or all of these services we typically identify each product and service as an individual performance obligation 

principal vs agent 

when a thirdparty is involved in the delivery of our services to the client we assess whether or not we are acting as a principal or an agent in the arrangement the assessment is based on whether we control the specified services at any time before they are transferred to the customer we have determined that in our events and public relations businesses we generally act as a principal as our agencies provide a significant service of integrating goods or services provided by third parties into the specified deliverable to our clients in addition we have determined that we are responsible for the performance of the thirdparty suppliers which are combined with our own services before transferring those services to the customer we have also determined that we act as principal when providing creative services and media planning services as we perform a significant integration service in these transactions for performance obligations in which we act as principal we record the gross amount billed to the customer within total revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as billable expenses 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

when a thirdparty is involved in the production of an advertising campaign and for media buying services we have determined that we act as the agent and are solely arranging for the thirdparty suppliers to provide services to the customer specifically we do not control the specified services before transferring those services to the customer we are not primarily responsible for the performance of the thirdparty services nor can we redirect those services to fulfill any other contracts we do not have inventory risk or discretion in establishing pricing in our contracts with customers for performance obligations for which we act as the agent we record our revenue as the net amount of our gross billings less amounts remitted to third parties 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes us federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 

we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets which is primarily dependent on future earnings a valuation allowance shall be recognized when based on available evidence it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the factors used in assessing valuation allowances include all available evidence such as past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in circumstances where there is negative evidence establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance conversely a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance further in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings 

the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally guidance is provided for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments we evaluate our tax positions using the “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of october 1 st each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we have 9 reporting units that were subject to the 2021 annual impairment testing our annual impairment review as of october 1 2021 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units 

in performing our annual impairment review we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings financial performance and other relevant entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or clients as well as pending litigation if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the entity is required to determine the fair value and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value otherwise no additional testing is required 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

for reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value a quantitative impairment test is performed for our annual impairment test we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units equity to the carrying value of their net assets the sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the quantitative impairment test is failed and impaired goodwill is written down to its fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

for the 2021 and 2020 annual impairment tests we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for six and seven reporting units respectively and performed the quantitative impairment test for three and five reporting units respectively for the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances including financial performance macroeconomic conditions and entityspecific factors such as client wins and losses based on this assessment we have concluded that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value therefore no additional testing was required 

the 2021 and 2020 fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data we generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our analysis for the income approach we used projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth profit margins terminal value growth rates capital expenditures projections assumed tax rates discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management for the market approach we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparablecompany market multiples 

these estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that reporting unit the discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit for the 2021 test the discount rate we used for our reporting units tested ranged between 105 and 120 and the terminal value growth rate was 30 the terminal value growth rate represents the expected longterm growth rate for our industry which incorporates the type of services each reporting unit provides as well as the global economy for the 2021 test the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 50 and 60 factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit we believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period actual results of operations cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation and it is possible that differences and changes could be material a deterioration in profitability adverse market conditions significant client losses changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future 

we also perform a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit where the low end of the range increases discount rates by 05 and the high end of the range decreases discount rates by 05 we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the quantitative impairment test 

the table below displays the midpoint of the fair value range for each reporting unit tested in the 2021 and 2020 annual impairment tests indicating that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units by greater than 20 except for reporting unit b in 2020 whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 150 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

based on the analysis described above for the reporting units for which we performed the quantitative impairment test we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of october 1 2021 because these reporting units passed the test as the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values 

we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups these asset groups are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations we determine our discount rates for our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and significant foreign pension plans based on either a bond selectionsettlement approach or bond yield curve approach using the bond selectionsettlement approach we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments using the bond yield curve approach we determine the discount rate by matching the plans cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve both approaches utilize highquality aarated corporate bonds and the plans projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments which is then used to develop a single discount rate in countries where markets for highquality longterm aa corporate bonds are not well developed a portfolio of longterm government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate 

the discount rate used to calculate net pension and postretirement benefit costs is determined at the beginning of each year for the year ended december 31 2021 discount rates of 260 for the domestic pension plan and 250 for the domestic postretirement benefit plan and a weightedaverage discount rate of 135 for the significant foreign pension plans were used to calculate 2021 net pension and postretirement benefit costs a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the discount rate would not have impacted the 2021 net pension and postretirement benefit cost 

the discou nt rate used to measure our benefit obligations is determined at the end of each year as of december 31 2021 we used discount rates of 295 for the domestic pension plan and 290 for the domestic postretirement benefit plan and a weightedaverage discount rate of 186 for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the benefit obligation as of december 31 2021 by approximately 240 and 260 respectively 

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions current and expected market conditions risk premiums associated with asset classes and longterm inflation rates we determine both a shortterm and longterm view and then select a longterm rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities 

for 2021 the weightedaverage expected rates of return of 575 and 447 were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively for 2022 we plan to use expected rates of return of 500 and 447 for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held a lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2021 net pension cost by approximately 10

nongaap financial measure 

this mda includes both financial measures in accordance with us gaap as well as a nongaap financial measure the nongaap financial measure repre sents net income available to ipg common stockhol der before provision for income taxes total expenses and other income equit y in net income of unconsolidated a ffiliate s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and amortization of acquired intangibles which we refer to as “adjusted ebita” 

adjusted ebita should be viewed as supplemental to and not as an alternative for net income available to ipg common stockholders calculated in accordance with us gaap net income or operating income calculated in accordance with us gaap operating income this section also includes reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures as presented below 

adjusted ebita is used by our management as an additional measure of our company’s performance for purposes of business decisionmaking including developing budgets managing expenditures and evaluating potential acquisitions or divestitures periodtoperiod comparisons of adjusted ebita help our management identify additional trends in our company’s financial results that may not be shown solely by periodtoperiod comparisons of net income or operating income in addition we may use adjusted ebita in the incentive compensation programs applicable to some of our employees in order to evaluate our company’s performance our management recognizes that adjusted ebita has inherent limitations because of the excluded items particularly those items that are recurring in nature management also reviews operating income and net income as well as the specific items that are excluded from adjusted ebita but included in net income or operating income as well as trends in those items the amounts of those items are set forth for the applicable periods in the reconciliation of adjusted ebita to net income that accompany our disclosure documents containing nongaap financial measures including the reconciliations contained in this mda 

we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebita is useful to investors in their analysis of our results for reasons similar to the reasons why our management finds it useful and because it helps facilitate investor understanding of decisions made by management in light of the performance metrics used in making those decisions in addition as more fully described below we believe that providing adjusted ebita together with a reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure to net income helps investors make comparisons between our company and other companies that may have different capital structures different effective income tax rates and tax attributes different capitalized asset values andor different forms of employee compensation however adjusted ebita is intended to provide a supplemental way of comparing our company with other public companies and is not intended as a substitute for comparisons based on net income or operating income in making any comparisons to other companies investors need to be aware that companies may use different nongaap measures to evaluate their financial performance investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measures and the corresponding us gaap measures provided by each company under the applicable rules of the us securities and exchange commission 

the following is an explanation of the items excluded by us from adjusted ebita but included in net income 

  

• total expense and other income provision for income taxes equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests we exclude these items i because these items are not directly attributable to the performance of our business operations and accordingly their exclusion assists management and investors in making periodtoperiod comparisons of operating performance and ii to assist management and investors in making comparisons to companies with different capital structures investors should note that these items will recur in future periods 

• amortization of acquired intangibles  amortization of acquired intangibles is a noncash expense relating to intangible assets arising from acquisitions that are expensed on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the related assets we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles because we believe that i the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and ii such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of new acquisitions and full amortization of previously acquired intangible assets accordingly we believe that this exclusion assists management and investors in making periodtoperiod comparisons of operating performance investors should note that the use of acquired intangible assets contributed to revenue in the periods presented and will contribute to future revenue generation and should also note that such expense may recur in future periods

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

amounts in millions 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items from time to time we use derivative instruments pursuant to established guidelines and policies to manage some portion of these risks derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rates 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations the majority of our debt approximately 97 as of both december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively bears interest at fixed rates we do have debt with variable interest rates but a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a 10 change in interest rates is summarized below 



we had 32735 of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2021 that we generally invest in conservative shortterm bank deposits or securities the interest income generated primarily from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements during 2021 and 2020 we had interest income of 297 and 295 respectively based on our 2021 results a 100 basispoint increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately 327 assuming that all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from yearend 2021 levels 

foreign currency rates 

we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations the foreign currencies that most favorably impacted our results during the year ended december 31 2021 were the british pound sterling the euro australian dollar and canadian dollar the foreign currencies that most adversely impacted our results during the year ended december 31 2021 were the brazilian real and argentine peso based on 2021 exchange rates and operating results if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10 we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4 assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2021 levels 

the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency mitigating transaction risk however certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and other direct expenses we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges or net investment hedges to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes 

we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period if this occurs the functional currency of that country is changed to our reporting currency the us dollar and foreign exchange gains or losses are recognized on all monetary transactions assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary 

credit and market risks 

balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities accounts receivable and accounts receivable billable to clients we invest our cash primarily in investmentgrade shortterm securities and bank deposits and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for expected credit losses based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 

our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods

market strategy 

we operate in a media landscape that continues to evolve at a rapid pace media channels continue to fragment and clients face an increasingly complex consumer environment to stay ahead of these challenges and to achieve our objectives we have made and continue to make investments in creative strategic and technology talent in areas including fastgrowth digital marketing channels highgrowth geographic regions and strategic world markets in addition we consistently review opportunities within our company to enhance our operations through acquisitions and strategic alliances and internal programs that encourage intracompany collaboration as appropriate we also develop relationships with technology and emerging media companies that are building leadingedge marketing tools that complement our agencies skill sets and capabilities 

in recent years we have taken several major strategic steps to position our agencies as leaders in the global advertising and communications market these include 

• investment in leading talent we believe our continued ability to attract and develop top talent and to be the industry’s employer of choice for an increasingly diverse workforce have been key differentiators for ipg we continue to acquire and develop top strategic creative and digital talent from a range of backgrounds 

• growing digital capabilities our investments in talent and technology  organically growing digital capabilities such as search social user experience ux content creation analytics and mobile across the portfolio  promise to drive further growth in this dynamic sector of our business we continue to internationalize our powerful digital specialist agencies 

• datafueled offerings media and marketing is increasingly centered around the ability to manage data to create deeper direct customer relationships acxiom provides the tools to help our clients connect with individual consumers at scale kinesso furthers this vision by bringing together top data and technology talent with addressable media experts to develop software that amplifies clients marketing and leverages acxiom’s assets and capabilities 

• investments in emerging and strategic markets we strengthen our position in global markets by driving organic growth as well as completing strategic acquisitions 

• integrated marketing solutions a differentiating aspect of our business is our utilization of “open architecture” solutions that integrate the best talent from throughout the organization to fulfill the needs of our clients 

together these steps have built a culture of strategic creativity and high performance across ipg despite the challenges faced by our industry clients and workforce in 2020 we once again delivered sectorleading performance this result demonstrates the continued competitiveness of our offerings the value of our longterm strategy and the strength of our culture which is especially significant during such unprecedented times 

in 2020 at the agency level ipg continues to be recognized for having many of the industry’s most vibrant brands two of our agencies were named as adweek agencies of the year fcb was named global agency of the year and the martin agency was named us agency of the year six of our agencies were honored by ad age on its alist and related rankings and once again our company led the industry in terms of number of agencies recognized on the trade publication’s prestigious annual ranking of the industry’s top marketing and communications agencies at the inaugural campaign us agency of the year awards held in 2020 ipg took home eight honors more than the number of awards won by all other holding companies combined these awards which are judged by clients recognize inspired leadership creative excellence outstanding business performance and overall achievements for both agencies and individuals 

datafueled offerings 

ipg decided to incorporate data expertise into the core of the company understanding data and its power is critical to the current and future success of our company we believe an ethical and conscious approach that respects consumer privacy and promotes brand safety will be crucial as we navigate increased regulation in the digital media space 

going forward we intend to continue to enhance the technology layer within our offerings and to build techenabled marketing solutions informed by a holistic understanding of audiences this will allow us to deliver personalized user experiences and more accountable marketing for brands ultimately our vision for ipg is to be a key partner in ensuring that clients’ businesses thrive in the digital economy

diversity equity and inclusion 

ipg and our agencies are committed to diversity and inclusion and we reinforce these values through a comprehensive set of awardwinning programs these include business resource groups that develop career building programs as well as training around topics like unconscious bias we seek to ensure accountability by tying executive compensation directly to the ability of our leaders to hire promote and retain diverse talent and we regularly measure the inclusiveness of our culture with a companywide climate for inclusion survey 

we began our formal programs over a decade ago since then ipg has seen notable improvements in the diversity of our workforce and further progress is a management priority in 2020 ipg became the first advertising holding company to release race and gender composition of its leadership based on its eeo1 report and we are committed to continuous transparency in this area we believe that an environment that encourages respect and trust is key to a creative business like ours and that a competitive advantage comes with having a variety of perspectives and beliefs in our workforce 

acquisition strategy 

a disciplined acquisition strategy focused on highgrowth capabilities and regions of the world is one component of growing our services in todays rapidlychanging marketing services and media landscape when an outstanding resource or a 

strong tactical fit becomes available we have been opportunistic over the years in making tuckin niche acquisitions that enhance our service offerings 

in recent years ipg has acquired agencies across the marketing spectrum including firms specializing in data and tech ecommerce mobile marketing social media healthcare communications and public relations as well as agencies with fullservice capabilities these acquired agencies have been integrated into one of our global networks or specialist agencies 

our people 

because of the service character of our business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success and our employees including creative digital research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most valuable assets we conduct extensive employee training and development throughout our agencies and benchmark our compensation programs against those of our industry for their competitiveness and effectiveness in recruitment and retention there is keen competition for qualified employees 

as of december 31 2020 we employed approximately 50200 people of which approximately 21100 were employed in the united states 





1 numbers are approximate and may not total due to rounding 

we employ a balanced approach in managing our human capital resources depending on where a humancapital management function is most effective or efficient processes are either managed at the holding company or designated to our operating units to adopt strategies appropriate for their client sector workforce makeup talent requirements and business demands 

the holding company retains oversight of all human capital resources and activities setting standards and providing support and policy guidance and sharing programs at the corporate center centralized human capital management processes include development of human resources governance and policy executive compensation for senior leaders across the company benefits programs succession planning focusing on the performance development and retention of the company’s seniormost executives and key roles in the operating units and executive development 

ipg sets specific standards for human capital management and on a yearly basis assesses each operating unit’s performance in managing and developing its workforce we undertake human capital initiatives with an aim of ensuring that employees have the high level of competence and commitment our businesses need to succeed we formally assess our operating units against their efforts in the areas of people development diversity and inclusion performance management talent acquisition and organization development in order to drive or support the units’ strategic business and growth goals accordingly the operating units create and deploy skillstraining programs management training employee goalsetting and feedback platforms applicanttracking systems newemployee onboarding processes and other programs intended to enhance the performance and engagement of the workforce 

as discussed above under market strategy — diversity equity and inclusion  diversity equity and inclusion are essential priorities for ipg our goal is that our talent represents the diversity of our communities and consumers with a corporate culture that drives belonging wellbeing and growth we believe that such a workplace will enable us to provide cultural insights to help our clients make authentic and responsible connections with their customers the programs we provide in support of diversity equity and inclusion include events training and curated and bespoke content research and tools to foster awareness and action on an array of critical issues that we believe are vital for the recruitment retention advancement wellbeing and belonging for people who are part of underrepresented groups we also foster business resource groups that offer programs on all facets of diversity and inclusion in support of specific communities of employees 

the events of the past year have highlighted the importance of providing emotional as well as material support to our employees in these demanding times in response to the ongoing covid19 public health crisis we provided increased support for our people through oneonone and group therapy sessions selfcare workshops and management training and as we 

learned what we believed was working well for ipg we offered counsel to our clients to address their own employee concerns during this time during a period of heightened worldwide racial strife and unrest we continued our active focus on inclusivity and equality we released statistics around race and gender in our executive leadership our diversity and inclusion team hosted neighborhood chats and ally conversations for employees globally and we created bespoke resources for our employees like our “inclusive at work” website which contains a “racial equality center” a “manager’s guide to initial responses to racial turmoil” a “guide to personal pronouns” and other resources 

impact of covid19 

in march 2020 the world health organization categorized the novel coronavirus covid19 as a pandemic and it continues to spread extensively throughout the united states and the rest of the world the outbreak of covid19 and public and private sector measures to reduce its transmission such as forced business closures and limits on operations the imposition of social distancing and orders to workfromhome stayathome and shelterinplace have adversely impacted our business and demand for our services some businesses have adjusted reduced or suspended operating activities which has negatively impacted the markets we serve we continue to believe that our focus on our strategic strengths which include talent our differentiated gotomarket strategy data management capabilities and the relevance of our offerings position us well to navigate a rapidly changing marketplace the effects of the covid19 pandemic have negatively impacted and will likely continue to negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position however the extent of the impact will vary depending on the duration and severity of the economic and operational impacts of covid19 as well as the effectiveness of mass vaccination and other public health efforts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic 

at the outset of the covid19 pandemic we responded swiftly in support of our people our clients and our communities to protect our employees and to do our part in stopping the spread of covid19 within days 95 percent of our global workforce moved to a remote work environment the majority of our worldwide workforce continues to work from home we recognized the importance of regular communication to reassure employees and to keep them updated on our plans as the pandemic unfolded and ipg was recognized with top honors at the corporate content awards north america for its outstanding communication during the pandemic we adopted an approach of “organized flexibility” to facilitate the new working environments and take into account the need of many employees to work during nontraditional hours and juggle home lives and work responsibilities 

we believe we have had significant success in maintaining and continuing to advance the quality of our services notwithstanding extensive changes required by the pandemic with respect to managing costs we undertook multiple initiatives which continue to align our expenses with changes in revenue the steps we have taken across our agencies and corporate group include deferred merit increases freezes on hiring and temporary labor major cuts in nonessential spending staff reductions furloughs in markets where that option is available and salary reductions including voluntary salary reductions for our senior corporate management team 

starting in the second quarter of 2020 and continuing through the year the company also took restructuring actions to lower our operating expenses structurally and permanently relative to revenue and to accelerate the transformation of our business most of these actions are based on our recent experience and learning in the covid19 pandemic and a resulting review of our operations notably we foresee a greater role for workfromhome in a hybrid officehome model to deliver and support our services in a postcovid world 

we discuss these restructuring actions as well as steps to strengthen our financial position that we undertook in 2020 in more detail in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” 

financial objectives 

our financial goals include competitive organic net revenue growth and expansion of adjusted ebita margin as defined and discussed within the nongaap financial measure section of the mda which we expect will further strengthen our balance sheet and total liquidity and increase value to our shareholders accordingly we remain focused on meeting the evolving needs of our clients while concurrently managing our cost structure our disciplined approach to our balance sheet and liquidity provides us with a solid financial foundation and financial flexibility to manage and grow our business we believe that our strategy and execution position us to meet our financial goals and to deliver longterm shareholder value 

financial reporting segments 

we have two reportable segments which are integrated agency networks “ian” and ipg dxtra ian is comprised of mccann worldgroup fcb mullenlowe group media data services and tech which includes mediabrands acxiom kinesso and matterkind our digital specialist agencies and our domestic integrated agencies ipg dxtra is comprised of a number of our specialist marketing services offerings in public relations sports and experiential marketing and branding we also report results for the “corporate and other” group see note 15 in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  for further information 

sources of revenue 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world our revenues are directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients and our ability to win new clients most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 30 to 90 days although our data management contracts typically have noncancelable terms of more than one year 

revenues for the creation and production of advertising or the planning and placement of media are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided 

we also generate revenue from data and technology offerings and in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion experiential marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients as is customary in the advertising and marketing industries to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients and in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor in these arrangements 

our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter 



clients 

our large and diverse client base includes many of the most recognizable companies and brands throughout the world our holding company structure allows us to maintain a diversified client base across and within a full range of industry sectors in the aggregate our top ten clients based on net revenue accounted for approximately 20 of net revenue in 2020 and 17 in 2019 our largest client accounted for approximately 3 of net revenue in both 2020 and 2019 based on net revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 our largest client sectors in alphabetical order were financial services healthcare and technology and telecom we represent several different clients brands or divisions within each of these sectors in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency brands representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency and a client may change its marketing budget at any time 

we operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry our operating companies compete against other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies and new forms of market participants to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships 

regulatory environment 

the advertising and marketing services that our agencies provide are subject to governmental regulation and other action in all of the jurisdictions in which the company operates while these governmental regulations and other actions can impact the company’s operations the specific marketing regulations we may face in a given market do not as a general matter significantly impact the company’s overall service offerings or the nature in which we provide these services

 item 1a risk factors tableend

we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition see also statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure 

risks related to the global market and the economy 

• the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business financial condition and results of operations and the extent of the continuing impact is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

the global spread of covid19 has created significant worldwide operational volatility uncertainty and disruption the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business financial condition and results of operations and the extent of the continuing impact will depend on numerous evolving factors which are highly uncertain rapidly changing and cannot be predicted including 

• the duration severity and scope of the pandemic 

• governmental business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the outbreak including travel restrictions quarantines social distancing workathome stayathome and shelterinplace orders and shutdowns 

• the effectiveness and timing of covid19 vaccination campaigns or any perceived limitations of or setbacks in these efforts 

• the impact of the pandemic on the financial markets and economic activity generally 

• the effect of the pandemic on our clients and other business partners 

• our ability to access usual sources of liquidity on reasonable terms 

• our ability to comply with the financial covenant in our credit agreement if the material economic downturn results in increased indebtedness or substantially lower ebitda 

• potential goodwill or other impairment charges 

• our ability to achieve the benefits of the 2020 restructuring plan and other costsaving initiatives 

• increased cybersecurity risks as a result of remote working conditions 

• our ability during the pandemic to provide our services including the health and wellbeing of our employees and 

• the ability of our clients to pay for our services during and following the pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic has significantly increased financial and economic volatility and uncertainty the continued downturn in the economy has had and we expect will continue to have a negative impact on many of our clients some clients have responded to the weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets thereby decreasing the market and demand for our services in addition many businesses have adjusted reduced or suspended operating activities which has negatively impacted the markets we serve all of the foregoing has impacted and will likely continue to impact our business financial condition results of operations and forwardlooking expectations 

furthermore modified processes procedures and controls have been required to respond to the changes in our business environment as the majority of our employees have continued to work from home and many onsite locations remain closed the significant increase in remote working of our employees may exacerbate certain risks to our business including the increased demand for information technology resources increased risk of malicious technologyrelated events such as cyberattacks and phishing attacks and increased risk of improper dissemination of personal proprietary or confidential information 

the potential effects of covid19 could also heighten the risks disclosed in many of our other risk factors that are included below including as a result of but not limited to the factors listed above 

• our results of operations are highly susceptible to unfavorable economic conditions 

we are exposed to risks associated with weak or uncertain regional or global economic conditions and disruption in the financial markets following the severe downturn in most markets following the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic the global economy continues to be challenging economic downturns or uncertainty about the strength of the global economy generally or economic conditions in certain regions or market sectors and caution on the part of marketers can have an effect 

on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services in addition market conditions can be and have been adversely affected by natural and human disruptions such as natural disasters public health crises severe weather events military conflict or civil unrest our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general in the past including in connection with the outbreak of the covid19 pandemic some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses this pattern may recur in the future furthermore unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions or other market disruptions that adversely affect client spending the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations 

risks related to our industry and operations 

• we operate in a highly competitive industry 

the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive and constantly changing our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and other providers of creative marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants 

competitive challenges also arise from rapidlyevolving and new technologies in the marketing and advertising space creating opportunities for new and existing competitors and a need for continued significant investment in tools technologies and process improvements as datadriven marketing solutions become increasingly core to the success of our brands any failure to keep up with rapidly changing technologies and standards in this space could harm our competitive position 

the client’s perception of the quality of our agencies’ creative work its confidence in our ability to protect the confidentiality of their and their customers’ data and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services and technologies may also be an important competitive consideration on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people and freedom of entry into the industry is almost unlimited our relationships with clients can be affected by the departure of key personnel and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

• clients may terminate or reduce their relationships with us on short notice 

many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time and we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions our clients may choose to terminate their contracts or reduce their relationships with us on a relatively short time frame and for any reason a relatively small number of clients contribute a significant portion of our revenue in the aggregate our top ten clients based on net revenue accounted for approximately 20 of net revenue in 2020 a substantial decline in a large client’s advertising and marketing spending or the loss of a significant part of its business could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 

our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest or our own exclusivity arrangements with certain clients these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

• we may lose or fail to attract and retain key employees and management personnel 

our employees including creative digital research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most valuable assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and factors which may be beyond our control changes to us or other immigration policies or travel restrictions imposed as a result of public health political or security concerns that restrain the flow of professional talent may inhibit our ability to staff our offices or projects in addition the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility and significant use of thirdparty or temporary workers to staff new growing or temporary assignments if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients or fail to manage our workforce effectively our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

• if our clients experience financial distress or seek to change or delay payment terms it could negatively affect our own financial position and results 

we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business unfavorable economic and financial conditions such as those 

resulting from the covid19 pandemic could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and writeoffs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients and if these effects were severe the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity 

furthermore in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities to the extent possible we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients however if clients are unable to pay for commitments that we have entered into on their behalf or if clients seek to significantly delay or otherwise alter payment terms there could be an adverse effect on our working capital which would negatively impact our operating cash flow 

• international business risks could adversely affect our operations 

we are a global business with agencies operating in over 100 countries including every significant world market operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our net revenues approximately 35 in 2020 these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation currency variation exchange control restrictions local labor and employment laws that hinder workforce flexibility largescale local or regional public health crises and other difficult social political or economic conditions we also must comply with applicable us local and other international anticorruption laws including the fcpa and the uk antibribery act 2010 which can be comprehensive complex and stringent in all jurisdictions where we operate certain of which present heightened compliance challenges export controls and economic sanctions such as those maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury can impose limitations on our ability to operate in certain geographic regions or to seek or service certain potential clients these restrictions can place us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to those competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions failure to comply or to implement business practices that sufficiently prevent corruption or violation of sanctions laws could result in significant remediation expense and expose us to significant civil and criminal penalties and reputational harm 

given our substantial operations in the united kingdom and continental europe we face continued uncertainty surrounding the implementation and consequences of the united kingdom’s exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” under the withdrawal agreement negotiated between the uk and the eu the uk as of january 31 2020 is no longer a member of the european union in december 2020 the uk and the eu reached agreement on the new rules that govern the relationship between them as of january 1 2021 as the parties implement and adjust to their new relationship it is possible that brexit and changes resulting from brexit will cause increased regulatory and legal complexities large exchange rate fluctuations and negative economic impacts these impacts and any increased restrictions on the free movement of labor capital goods and services between the united kingdom and the remaining members of the european union could create uncertainty surrounding our business including our relationships with existing and future clients suppliers and employees and have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations 

in addition in developing countries or regions we may face further risks such as slower receipt of payments nationalization social and economic instability currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries 

• we are subject to industry regulations and other legal or reputational risks that could restrict our activities or negatively impact our performance or financial condition 

our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation regulation judicial actions or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare our business is also subject to specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products 

existing and proposed laws and regulations in particular in the european union and the united states concerning user privacy use of personal information and online tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internetbased digital and targeted marketing we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern whether and how we can transfer process or receive certain data that we use in our operations the european union for example has recently tightened its rules on the transferability of data to the united states collection processing and storage of biometric identifiers has come under increasing regulation and is the subject of class action litigation the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may increase in the future as a result of the implementation of new laws or regulations such as the gdpr and the ccpa or changes in interpretations of current ones such as the interpretation of existing consumer protection laws as imposing restrictions on the online collection storage and use of personal data any failure on our part to comply with these legal requirements or their application in an unanticipated manner could harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability 

the imposition of restrictions on certain technologies by private market participants in response to privacy concerns could also have a negative impact on our digital business if we are unable to transfer data between countries and regions in which we operate or if we are prohibited from sharing data among our products and services it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results 

legislators agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products such as alcohol tobacco or marijuana products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients’ goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently on our revenues governmental action including judicial rulings on the relative responsibilities of clients and their marketing agencies for the content of their marketing can also impact our operations furthermore we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial 

• we rely extensively on information technology systems and could face cybersecurity risks 

we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information develop new business opportunities and digital products and process business transactions our business operations depend on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and sensitive information over the internet and through interconnected systems the incidence of malicious technologyrelated events such as cyberattacks computer hacking computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software phishing attacks and other attempts to gain access to confidential or personal data denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide and highlights the need for continual and effective cybersecurity awareness and education we are increasingly the target of hackers denial of service attacks malicious code and other threat actors which can result in the unauthorized access misuse loss or destruction of data including confidential and sensitive data unavailability of services or other adverse events 

our business which increasingly involves the collection use and transmission of customer data may make us and our agencies attractive targets for malicious thirdparty attempts to access this data power outages equipment failure natural disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information we utilize inhouse and third parties including thirdparty “cloud” computing services to perform key operational functions including the storage transfer or processing of data system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such inhouse or third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business we maintain and we require our thirdparty service providers to maintain security controls designed to ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems and the confidential and sensitive information we maintain and process despite our best efforts however the threat landscape is constantly evolving a cybersecurity incident or data breach affecting the confidentiality integrity or availability of the information we process our data systems or those operated on our behalf by thirdparty service providers could adversely affect our ability to manage our risk exposure and could significantly harm our business we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis with a large number of agencies and legal entities and the resulting size diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase our potential vulnerability to such breakdowns malicious intrusions or attacks 

data privacy or cybersecurity breaches as well as improper use of social media by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data such as personally identifiable information strategic plans and trade secrets could be exposed to third parties or to the general public any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability be expensive to remedy result in a loss of our or our clients’ or vendors’ proprietary information and damage our reputation efforts to develop implement and maintain security measures are costly may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and cyberattack techniques change frequently or are not recognized until successful and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated we operate worldwide and the legal rules governing data transfers are often complex conflicting unclear or everchanging increased privacy and cybersecurity requirements may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our business 

• we face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments 

we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients such as our acquisition of acxiom in 2018 these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment our customary business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity our forecasts of the investment’s future performance also factor into the initial consideration when actual financial results differ our returns on the investment could be adversely affected 

we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees businesses assets or systems into our organization including with respect to our internal policies and required controls we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investments operations furthermore it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all talent is among our most valuable assets and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel acquisition and integration activity may also divert management’s attention and other corporate resources from other business needs if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

• the costs of compliance with sustainability or other environmental social responsibility or governance esg laws regulations or policies including investor and clientdriven policies and standards could adversely affect our business 

as a non–location–specific non–manufacturing service business we have to date been sheltered from or able to mitigate many direct impacts from climate change and related laws and regulations we are however increasingly impacted by the effects of climate change and laws and regulations related to other sustainability concerns and we could incur related costs indirectly through our clients or investors increasingly our clients request that we comply with their own social responsibility sustainability or other business policies or standards which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations before they commence or continue doing business with us and esg issues are increasingly a focus of the investor community for example some clients and investors are requesting that we commit to a netzero carbon emissions goal and timeframe our compliance with these policies and related certification requirements could be costly and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business relationships or reputation if large shareholders were to reduce their ownership stakes in our company as a result of dissatisfaction with our policies or efforts in this area there could be negative impact on our stock price and we could also suffer reputational harm further if clients’ costs are adversely affected by climate change or related laws and regulations this could negatively impact their spending on our advertising and marketing services we could also face increased prices from our own suppliers that face climate changerelated costs and seek to pass on their increased costs to their customers 

risks related to our financial condition and results 

• our financial condition could be adversely affected if our available liquidity is insufficient 

agency operating cash flows have a significant impact on our liquidity and we maintain a commercial paper program a committed corporate credit facility and uncommitted lines of credit to increase flexibility in support of our operating needs if any of these sources were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity and ability to adequately fund our operations could be adversely affected furthermore if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity including in the capital markets there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

under our commercial paper program we are authorized to issue shortterm debt up to an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 15 billion which we use for working capital and general corporate purposes borrowings under the commercial paper program are supported by our 15 billion committed corporate credit facility the “credit agreement” if credit under the credit agreement or our ability to access the commercial paper market were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity could be adversely affected 

the credit agreement contains a leverage ratio and other nonfinancial covenants and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them for example compliance with the financial covenant would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience increased indebtedness or substantially lower revenues including as a result of economic downturns client losses or a substantial increase in client defaults if we were unable to comply with any of the covenants contained in the credit agreement we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders and our costs under these agreements could increase if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver the credit agreement could be terminated any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration and we could lose access to certain uncommitted financing arrangements and commercial paper 

for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook see liquidity and capital resources in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

• in connection with the acxiom acquisition we incurred a substantial amount of additional debt 

on october 1 2018 we completed the acquisition of acxiom for approximately 23 billion including customary closing adjustments the indebtedness we incurred to fund the acxiom acquisition significantly increased our outstanding debt levels and will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to servicing this debt as of december 31 2020 we had an aggregate principal amount of 7500 million of senior notes set to mature within two years if we are unable to generate sufficient funds to meet our obligations under our credit facilities or the debt securities we issued in connection with the 

acquisition we may be required to refinance restructure or otherwise amend some or all of our obligations sell assets or raise additional cash through the sale of our common stock or convertible securities and there could be a negative impact on our credit ratings we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain refinancing on terms as favorable as our current financing or that any restructuring sales of assets or issuances of equity can be accomplished or if accomplished would raise sufficient funds to meet our obligations if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities that issuance could also result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders 

• downgrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us 

because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness including covenants and interest rates we could be adversely affected if our credit ratings were downgraded or if they were significantly weaker than those of our competitors our access to the commercial paper market is contingent on our maintenance of sufficient shortterm debt ratings and any downgrades to those ratings could increase our borrowing costs and reduce the market capacity for or our ability to issue commercial paper our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

• our earnings would be adversely affected if we were required to recognize asset impairment charges or increase our deferred tax valuation allowances 

we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets fixed assets and operating lease rightofuse assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance 

as of december 31 2020 we had substantial amounts of longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet including approximately 49 billion of goodwill future events including our financial performance market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies loss of a significant client’s business or strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets as well as our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets see critical accounting estimates in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

• our financial results are exposed to exchange rate risk 

because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the argentine peso brazilian real indian rupee mexican peso and south african rand fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies including the persistent strength of the us dollar in recent periods may adversely affect our financial results 

• we may not be able to meet our performance targets and milestones 

from time to time we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them see statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure

in march 2020 the world health organization categorized the novel coronavirus covid19 as a pandemic and it continues to spread extensively throughout the united states and the rest of the world the outbreak of covid19 and public and private sector measures to reduce its transmission such as forced business closures and limits on operations the imposition of social distancing and orders to workfromhome stayathome and shelterinplace have adversely impacted our business and demand for our services some businesses have adjusted reduced or suspended operating activities which has negatively impacted the markets we serve we continue to believe that our focus on our strategic strengths which include talent our differentiated gotomarket strategy data management capabilities and the relevance of our offerings position us well to navigate a rapidly changing marketplace the effects of the covid19 pandemic have negatively impacted and will likely continue to negatively impact our results of operations cash flows and financial position however the extent of the impact will vary depending on the duration and severity of the economic and operational impacts of covid19 as well as the effectiveness of mass vaccination and other public health efforts to mitigate the impact of the pandemic 

we have taken steps to protect the safety of our employees and to support their working arrangements with a majority of our worldwide workforce continuing to work from home we believe we have had significant success in maintaining and continuing to advance the quality of our services notwithstanding extensive changes required by the pandemic with respect to managing costs we undertook multiple initiatives which continue to align our expenses with changes in revenue the steps we have taken across our agencies and corporate group include deferred merit increases freezes on hiring and temporary labor major cuts in nonessential spending staff reductions furloughs in markets where that option is available and salary reductions including voluntary salary reductions for our senior corporate management team 

starting in the second quarter of 2020 and continuing through the year the company took restructuring actions to lower our operating expenses structurally and permanently relative to revenue and to accelerate the transformation of our business the “2020 plan” most of these actions are based on our recent experience and learning in the covid19 pandemic and a resulting review of our operations which continues to address certain operating expenses such as occupancy expense and salaries and related expenses notably we foresee a greater role for workfromhome in a hybrid officehome model to deliver and support our services in a postcovid world in addition we remain committed to and have intensified our efforts around cash flow discipline including the identification of significant capital expenditures that can be deferred and working capital management 

we saw the effects of covid19 on client spending throughout the year beginning in march first in the asia pacific region in the first quarter and subsequently in the us europe and other markets growth in our retail and healthcare sector clients was offset by broadbased declines across most other sectors due to economic conditions though more so in our second

quarter than our third and fourth quarters with the greatest declines in our experiential and events businesses we saw continued negative impacts on our fourthquarter results as clients continue to respond to the current economic conditions by reducing their marketing budgets which affected the demand for our services we expect many of these trends will continue in 2021 with prospects for general economic recovery and improved financial performance in the second half of the year depending on the progression of the pandemic and the efficacy and speed of vaccination efforts globally see item 1a risk factors  in this annual report on form 10k 

we have also taken steps to strengthen our financial position during this period of heightened uncertainty as discussed in more detail under the “liquidity and capital resources” section in this item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda  on march 30 2020 we issued 6500 aggregate principal amount of 475 senior unsecured notes due 2030 the “475 senior notes” and on march 27 2020 we entered into a new 5000 364day revolving credit facility on july 28 2020 we entered into amendments to our committed corporate credit facility and our new 364day credit facility to increase our flexibility under the maximum leverage ratio covenant in each facility we believe these steps will further enhance our financial resources as we navigate the period ahead

our financial information 

when we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the remainder we call organic change which indicates how our underlying business performed we exclude the impact of billable expenses in analyzing our operating performance as the fluctuations from period to period are not indicative of the performance of our underlying businesses and have no impact on our operating income or net income 

the change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the priorperiod reported results using the currentperiod exchange rates and comparing these priorperiod adjusted amounts to the priorperiod reported results although the us dollar is our reporting currency a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies therefore our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar affect our consolidated results of operations and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact to our operations related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region the foreign currencies that most adversely impacted our results during the year ended december 31 2020 were the brazilian real argentine peso mexican peso indian rupee and south african rand

for purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred during the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan 

the metrics that we use to evaluate our financial performance include organic change in net revenue as well as the change in certain operating expenses and the components thereof expressed as a percentage of consolidated net revenue as well as adjusted ebita these metrics are also used by management to assess the financial performance of our reportable segments integrated agency networks ian and ipg dxtra dxtra in certain of our discussions we analyze net revenue by geographic region and by business sector in which we focus on our top 500 clients which typically constitute approximately 80 to 85 of our annual consolidated net revenues 

the consolidated financial statements and mda presented herein reflect the latest estimates and assumptions made by us that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods presented we believe we have used reasonable estimates and assumptions to assess the fair values of the company’s goodwill longlived assets and indefinitelived intangible assets assessment of the annual effective tax rate valuation of deferred income taxes and the allowance for expected credit losses on future uncollectible accounts receivable if actual market conditions vary significantly from those currently projected these estimates and assumptions could materially change resulting in adjustments to the carrying values of our assets and liabilities

our organic net revenue decrease of 48 for the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on advertising marketing and media spending in the auto and transportation technology and telecom consumer goods and financial services sectors partially offset by a combination of net client wins and net higher spending from existing clients in the healthcare and retail sectors during the year ended december 31 2020 our adjusted ebita margin on net revenue decreased to 84 from 136 in the prioryear period the decrease was primarily due to restructuring charges taken to lower our leased real estate a result of the increased role in our operations of work from home arrangements for our workforce in response to the global health crisis discussed in the  results of operations section 

our organic net revenue increase of 33 for the year ended december 31 2019 was driven by growth across nearly all geographic regions attributable to a combination of net higher spending from existing clients and net client wins most notably in the financial services healthcare retail and technology and telecom sectors partially offset by a decrease in the auto and transportation sector during the year ended december 31 2019 our adjusted ebita margin on net revenue grew to 136

results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 

net revenue 

our net revenue is directly impacted by the retention and spending levels of existing clients and by our ability to win new clients most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue our net revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter reflecting the seasonal spending of our clients 



the organic decrease in our domestic market was primarily due to the impact of the pandemic on the economy at our sports and experiential marketing businesses primarily due to sports and other event cancellations and on our discretionary digital projectbased offerings the decreases were partially offset by growth at our advertising and media businesses in our international markets the organic decrease was primarily driven by the revenue declines at our advertising and sports and experiential marketing businesses and public relations agencies primarily in the asia pacific and united kingdom regions as well as the revenue declines at our media businesses primarily in the continental europe and asia pacific regions 



the organic increase in our domestic market was primarily driven by growth at our advertising and media businesses as well as our data management business in our international markets the organic increase was primarily driven by strong performance at our media businesses throughout all geographic regions in addition the organic increase was also driven by growth at our advertising businesses and our public relations agencies as well as at our digital specialist agencies in latin america consolidated net acquisitions primarily includes net revenue during the first nine months ended september 30 2019 from acxiom which we acquired on october 1 2018 partially offset by divestitures mostly in our domestic market asia pacific and continental europe regions

salaries and related expenses 



salaries and related expenses decreased by 40 compared to our net revenue decline of 65 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prioryear period the decrease was primarily driven by reductions in base salaries benefits and tax and lower incentive and temporary help expenses in response to the decline in net revenue which was primarily due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on economic conditions the overall decreases were partially offset by increased severance expense 

net revenue growth of 74 outpaced the increase in salaries and related expenses of 51 during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the prioryear period primarily due to base salaries benefits and tax and temporary help expenses increasing at rates less than net revenue growth the improved ratio was also attributable to the inclusion of acxiom for the full year in 2019 which has a lower ratio of salaries and related expenses as a percentage of its net revenue as well as a result of carefully managing our employee costs 

office and other direct expenses 





1 includes production expenses travel and entertainment professional fees spending to support new business activity telecommunications office supplies bad debt expense adjustments to contingent acquisition obligations foreign currency losses gains and other expenses 

office and other direct expenses decreased by 125 compared to our net revenue decrease of 65 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prioryear period the decrease in office and other direct expenses was mainly due to decreases in travel and entertainment expenses and new business and promotion expenses as well as lower occupancy expense and professional consulting fees partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense 

office and other direct expenses increased by 154 compared to net revenue growth of 74 during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in office and other direct expenses was mainly due to the inclusion of acxiom for the full year in 2019 which has a higher ratio of office and other direct expenses as a percentage of its net revenue primarily driven by client service costs and professional fees additionally contributing to the increase was a yearoveryear change in contingent acquisition obligations partially offset by leverage on occupancy expense

percentage of net revenue decreased to 07 in 2020 from 11 in the prioryear period primarily attributable to a decrease in employee insurance expense as well as lower incentive expense and a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses sga as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 11 in 2019 from 21 in the prioryear period primarily attributable to lower professional fees mainly driven by transaction costs related to the acxiom acquisition in 2018 and an increase in allocated service fees from selling general and administrative expenses to cost of services mainly as a result of the inclusion of acxiom 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net revenue was 36 in 2020 32 in 2019 and 25 in 2018 the increases in 2019 compared to the prioryear period was primarily due to the inclusion of acxiom for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 amortization of acquired intangibles was 859 860 and 376 respectively 

restructuring charges 



2020 restructuring plan 

beginning in the second quarter of 2020 the company took restructuring actions to lower its operating expenses structurally and permanently relative to revenue and to accelerate the transformation of our business the “2020 plan” these actions continued through the fourth quarter and most are based on our recent experience and learning in the covid19 pandemic and a resulting review of our operations to address certain operating expenses such as occupancy expense and salaries and related expenses 

a summary of the restructuring activities related to the 2020 plan is as follows 



our charges for restructuring actions for the year ended december 31 2020 totaled 4138 and were designed to reduce our expenses such as occupancy expense and salaries and related expenses relative to our net revenue on an ongoing basis these actions taken during the second third and fourth quarters reduced our global real estate footprint by approximately 15 or 1700000 square feet and further downsized selected levels of management and staff with severance costs for 1520 employees or approximately 3 of the total charges for the year ended december 31 2020 2656 or 64 is noncash mainly representing the impairment of rightofuse assets of operating leases we expect to realize approximately 1600 of annualized cost savings associated with the actions taken as part of the 2020 restructuring plan 

net restructuring charges were comprised of 3179 at ian and 788 at dxtra for the year ended december 31 2020 which include noncash lease impairment costs of 1904 and 598 respectively

expenses and other income 



net interest expense 

for 2020 net interest expense remained relatively flat as compared to the prioryear period for 2019 net interest expense increased by 636 as compared to 2018 primarily attributable to increased cash interest expense from the issuance of 25000 of longterm debt in september and october of 2018 in order to finance the acquisition of acxiom partially offset by an increase in interest income primarily due to higher cash balances in international markets 

other expense net

income taxes 



effective tax rate 

our tax rates are affected by many factors including our worldwide earnings from various countries changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income 

in 2020 our effective income tax rate of 22 was positively impacted by the settlement of the us federal income tax audit of the years 2006 to 2016 partially offset by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we received no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances by net losses on sales of businesses and the classification of certain assets as held for sale for which we received minimal tax benefit and by tax expense associated with the change to our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of undistributed earnings attributable to certain foreign subsidiaries 

on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” was enacted and signed into law the cares act includes several provisions for corporations including increasing the amount of deductible interest allowing companies to carryback certain net operating losses “nols” and increasing the amount of nols that corporations can use to offset income the cares act did not materially affect our quarter or yeartodate income tax provision deferred tax assets and liabilities or related taxes payable 

in the second quarter of 2020 in response to changes in nonus tax law a decision was made to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion on a 1200 of undistributed foreign earnings of specific subsidiaries we recorded 104 of income tax costs associated wi th this change to our assertion 

in the third quarter of 2020 in response to restructuring actions taken within foreign subsidiaries a decision was made to change our indefinite reinvestment assertion on a 460 of undistributed foreign earnings of specific subsidiaries we recorded 32 of income tax costs associated with this change to our assertion 

on july 29 2020 the internal revenue service notified the company that the us federal income tax audit of years 2006 through 2016 has been finalized and settled as a result we recognized an income tax benefit of 1362 in the third quarter of 2020 

i n 2019 our effective income tax rate of 233 was positively impacted by the reversal of valuation allowances primarily in continental europe by the settlement of state income tax audits and by excess tax benefits on employee sharebased payments the effective tax rate was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances net losses on sales of businesses and the classification of certain assets as held for sale for which we received minimal tax benefit 

in 2018 our effective income tax rate of 238 was positively impacted by us tax incentives foreign tax credits from a distribution of unremitted earnings the net reversal of valuation allowance in continental europe and research and development credits the effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we received no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances nondeductible losses on sales of businesses and assets held for sale by tax expense associated with the change to our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of undistributed earnings attributable to certain foreign subsidiaries and by tax expense related to the trueup of our december 31 2017 tax reform estimates as permitted by sec staff issued accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” 

public law 11597 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was signed into law on december 22 2017 the tax act legislated many new tax provisions which impacted our operations at december 31 2017 provisional amounts were recorded as permitted by sab 118 the impact of the tax act as required by sab 118 resulted in a net tax expense of 134 in 2018 which was primarily attributable to our estimate of the tax imposed on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings 

the company has historically asserted that its unremitted foreign earnings are permanently reinvested and therefore did not record income taxes on such amounts in light of increased debt and associated servicing commitments in connection with the acxiom acquisition that was consummated on october 1 2018 the company reevaluated its global cash needs and as a result determined that approximately 4350 of undistributed foreign earnings from certain international entities were no longer subject to the permanent reinvestment assertion we recorded a tax expense of 108 in 2018 representing our estimate of the

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

tax costs associated with this change to our assertion we did not change our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to any other international entities as we used the related historical earnings and profits to fund international operations and investments 

the tax act imposed a new tax on certain foreign earnings generated in 2018 and forward these global intangible lowtaxed income gilti tax rules are complex us gaap allows us to choose an accounting policy which treats the us tax under gilti provisions as either a current expense as incurred or as a component of the company’s measurement of deferred taxes the company elected to account for the gilti tax as a current expense

our corporate and other segment is primarily comprised of selling general and administrative expenses including corporate office expenses as well as shared service center and certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions salaries longterm incentives annual bonuses and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees professional fees related to internal control compliance financial statement audits and legal information technology and other consulting services that are engaged and managed through the corporate office and rental expense for properties occupied by corporate office employees a portion of centrally managed expenses is allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the planned revenues of each of the operating units amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technologyrelated projects which are allocated based on utilization 

corporate and other expenses decreased by 205 to 813 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily attributable to a decrease in selling general and administrative expenses which was discussed in the results of operations section partially offset by an increase in restructuring charges corporate and other expenses in 2019 decreased by 742 to 1018 compared to 2018 primarily attributable to lower professional fees mainly driven by transaction costs of 350 related to the acxiom acquisition in 2018 and an increase in allocated service fees from selling general and administrative expenses to cost of services mainly as a result of the inclusion of acxiom 

during the year ended december 31 2020 and 2019 corporate and other expense includes 171 and 07 of restructuring charges respectively see restructuring charges in mda and note 11 of item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow overview 

the following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity capital resources and uses of capital 





1 reflects net income adjusted primarily for depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangible assets noncash restructuring charges amortization of restricted stock and other noncash compensation net losses on sales of businesses provision for uncollectible receivables and deferred income taxes 

2 reflects changes in accounts receivable other current assets accounts payable accrued liabilities and contract liabilities   

operating activities 

due to the seasonality of our business we typically use cash from working capital in the first nine months of a year with the largest impact in the first quarter and generate cash from working capital in the fourth quarter driven by the seasonally strong media spending by our clients quarterly and annual working capital results are impacted by the fluctuating annual media spending budgets of our clients as well as their changing media spending patterns throughout each year across various countries 

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients across various countries affects our working capital and operating cash flow and can be volatile in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients the amounts involved which substantially exceed our revenues primarily affect the level of accounts receivable accounts 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

payable accrued liabilities and contract liabilities our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments for example while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2020 was 18472 which was an increase of 3180 as compared to 2019 and the comparison includes 9001 generated from working capital in 2020 compared with 4428 generated from working capital in 2019 working capital in 2020 was primarily impacted by the variation in the timing of collections and payments around the reporting period which was favorable in 2020 as compared to 2019 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2019 was 15292 which was an increase of 9641 as compared to 2018 and the comparison includes 4428 generated from working capital in 2019 compared with 4311 used in working capital in 2018 working capital in 2019 was primarily impacted by the variation in the timing of collections and payments around the reporting period of which the timing that was unfavorable in late 2018 compared to 2017 was a benefit in 2019 as well as the spending levels and pattern of our clients as compared to 2018 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during 2020 consisted primarily of payments for capital expenditures of 1675 related mostly to computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements 

net cash used in investing activities during 2019 consisted primarily of payments for capital expenditures of 1985 related mostly to leasehold improvements and computer hardware and software 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during 2020 was driven by repayment of longterm debt of 5037 and the payment of dividends of 3981 partially offset by proceeds of 6462 net of discount of 38 from the issuance of our 475 senior notes due march 30 2030 the “475 senior notes 

net cash used in financing activities during 2019 was driven by repayment of longterm debt of 4033 and the payment of dividends of 3631 

foreign exchange rate changes 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a net increase of 310 in 2020 this increase was primarily a result of several foreign currencies strengthening compared to the us dollar including the euro and the australian dollar 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a net decrease of 60 in 2019 

liquidity outlook 

we expect our cash flow from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months we also have a commercial paper program a committed corporate credit facility a 364day credit facility that matures on march 26 2021 and uncommitted lines of credit to support our operating needs borrowings under our commercial paper program are supported by our committed corporate credit agreement we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity with flexibility over significant uses of cash including our capital expenditures cash used for new acquisitions our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends 

from time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional funds or otherwise improve our liquidity profile enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors which include those specific to us such as our credit ratings and those related to the financial markets such as the amount or terms of available credit particularly in light of the current market conditions there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity or continue to access existing sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

funding requirements 

our most significant funding requirements include our operations noncancelable operating lease obligations capital expenditures acquisitions common stock dividends taxes and debt service additionally we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests

notable funding requirements include 

• debt service – our 375 senior notes in aggregate principal amount of 5000 mature on october 1 2021 we expect to use available cash on hand as well as additional shortterm borrowings as needed to fund the principal repayment our 350 senior notes in aggregate principal amount of 5000 matured on october 1 2020 and we used available cash including the proceeds from the offering of our 475 senior notes to fund the principal repayment as of december 31 2020 we had outstanding shortterm borrowings of 480 from our uncommitted lines of credit used primarily to fund shortterm working capital needs the remainder of our debt is primarily longterm with maturities scheduled from 2022 through 2048 

• acquisitions – we paid cash of 56 net of cash acquired of 29 for acquisitions completed in 2020 we also paid deferred payments of 488 for prior acquisitions as well as ownership increases in our consolidated subsidiaries in addition to potential cash expenditures for new acquisitions we expect to pay approximately 480 over the next twelve months related to all completed acquisitions as of december 31 2020  we may also be required to pay approximately 140 related to put options held by minority shareholders if exercised over the next twelve months we will continue to ev aluate strategic opportunities to grow and continue to strengthen our market position particularly in our digital and marketing services offerings and to expand our presence in highgrowth and key strategic world markets 

• dividends – during 2020 we paid four quarterly cash dividends of 0255 per share on our common stock which corresponded to aggregate dividend payments of 3981 on february 10 2021 we announced that our board of directors the board had declared a common stock cash dividend of 027 per share payable on march 15 2021 to holders of record as of the close of business on march 1 2021 assuming we pay a quarterly dividend of 027 per share and there is no significant change in the number of outstanding shares as of december 31 2020 we would expect to pay approximately 4220 over the next twelve months whether to declare and the amount of any such future dividend is at the discretion of our board and will depend upon factors such as our earnings financial position and cash requirements 

• restructuring – during 2020 we paid cash of 736 for restructuring costs related to our 2020 plan designed to lower our operating expenses structurally and permanently relative to revenue and to accelerate the transformation of our business as of december 31 2020 our remaining liability related to restructuring actions was 746 most of our restructuring actions are based on our recent experience and learning in the covid19 pandemic and a resulting review of our operations to address certain operating expenses such as occupancy expense and salaries and related expenses

as of december 31 2020 3384 excluding fees remains available for repurchase under the share repurchase programs authorized in previous years which have no expiration date 

financing and sources of funds 

substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world including at the holding company level below is a summary of our sources of liquidity 

at december 31 2020 we held 9324 of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in foreign subsidiaries the company has historically asserted that its unremitted foreign earnings are permanently reinvested and therefore has not recorded any deferred taxes on such amounts in the second quarter of 2020 in response to changes in nonus tax law and in the third quarter of 2020 in response to restructuring actions taken within foreign subsidiaries the company determined that approximately 1200 and 460 respectively of undistributed foreign earnings from certain international entities were no longer subject to the permanent reinvestment assertion of which 1024 remains undistributed as of december 31 2020 

during the third quarter ended september 30 2018 the company reevaluated its global cash needs and as a result determined that approximately 4350 of undistributed foreign earnings from certain international entities were no longer subject to the permanent reinvestment assertion of which 1737 remains undistributed as of december 31 2020 we have not changed our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to any other international entities as we intend to use the related historical earnings and profits to fund international operations and investments 

credit arrangements 

we maintain a committed corporate credit facility originally dated as of july 18 2008 which has been amended and restated from time to time the credit agreement we use our credit agreement to increase our financial flexibility to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries and to support our commercial paper program the credit agreement is a revolving facility expiring in november 2024 under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 15000 or the equivalent in other currencies the company has the ability to increase the commitments under the credit agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to 2500 provided the company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase subject to a sublimit of 500 or the equivalent in other currencies our obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured as of december 31 2020 there were no borrowings under the credit agreement however we had 90 of letters of credit under the credit agreement which reduced our total availability to 14910 

on march 27 2020 we entered into an agreement for a 364day revolving credit facility the 364day credit facility that matures on march 26 2021 the 364day credit facility is a revolving facility under which amounts borrowed by us may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 5000 the cost structure of the 364day credit agreement is based on our current credit ratings the applicable margin for base rate advances as defined in the 364day credit facility is 0250 the applicable margin for eurodollar rate advances as defined in the 364day credit facility is 1250 and the facility fee payable on a lenders revolving commitment is 0250 in addition the 364day credit facility includes covenants that among other things i limit our liens and the liens of our consolidated subsidiaries and ii limit subsidiary debt the 364day credit facility also contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain on a consolidated basis as of the end of each fiscal quarter a leverage ratio for the four quarters then ended the leverage ratio and other covenants set forth in the 364day credit facility are equivalent to the covenants contained in the companys existing credit agreement which remains in full effect as of december 31 2020 there were no borrowings under the 364day credit facility 

on july 28 2020 we entered into amendment no 1 to the credit agreement and amendment no 1 to the 364day credit facility together the “amendments” the amendments increased the maximum leverage ratio covenant to 425x in the case of the 364day credit facility and in the case of the credit agreement to i 425x through the quarter ended june 30 2021 and ii 350x thereafter amendment no1 to the credit agreement also increased the applicable margin as defined in the credit agreement for any borrowings we make under the credit agreement if our longterm public debt ratings are bbba1 or below at the time of borrowing we have the option to terminate amendment no1 to the credit agreement at any time provided that at the time we deliver a termination notice the leverage ratio as of the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter did not exceed 350x the credit agreement reverts to its original terms on june 30 2021 or following any such early termination whichever is earlier we paid amendment fees of 20 in connection with the amendments 

we were in compliance with all of our covenants in both the credit agreement and the 364day credit facility as of december 31 2020 the financial covenant in the credit agreement and the 364day credit facility requires that we maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter a certain leverage ratio for the four quarters then ended

3 includes adjustments of the following items from our consolidated statement of operations in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  provision for income taxes total expenses and other income equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  

uncommitted lines of credit 

we also have uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates and that are primarily used to fund working capital needs we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some of our operations as of december 31 2020 the company had uncommitted lines of credit in an aggregate amount of 8576 under which we had outstanding borrowings of 480 classified as shortterm borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet the average amount outstanding during 2020 was 865 with a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 36 

commercial paper 

the company is authorized to issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 15000 borrowings under the commercial paper program are supported by the credit agreement described above proceeds of the commercial paper are used for working capital and general corporate purposes including the repayment of maturing indebtedness and other shortterm liquidity needs the maturities of the commercial paper vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue as of december 31 2020 there was no commercial paper outstanding the average amount outstanding under the program was 1058 in 2020 with a weightedaverage interest rate of 15 and a weightedaverage maturity of twelve days 

cash pooling 

we aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the united states we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several ipg agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all agencies does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of bank overdrafts under all of our pooling arrangements and as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the amounts netted were 27022 and 22749 respectively 

debt credit ratings 

our debt credit ratings as of february 11 2021 are listed below 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity either adverse or favorable because among other things they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise for example our credit agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid and our access to the commercial paper market is contingent on our maintenance of sufficient shortterm debt ratings 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our consolidated financial statements management has discussed with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising and communications marketing services including public relations meeting and event production sports and entertainment marketing corporate and brand identity strategic marketing consulting and providing marketing data and technology services around the world 

most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the basis on which we earn fees and commissions vary significantly our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 30 to 90 days although our data management contracts typically have noncancelable terms of more than one year our payment terms vary by client and the time between invoicing date and due date is typically not significant we generally have the legally enforceable right to payment for all services provided through the end of the contract or termination date 

we recognize revenue when we determine our customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services to determine revenue recognition we perform the following five steps i identify the contracts with a customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue as or when we satisfy the performance obligation we only apply the fivestep model to contracts when it is probable that ipg will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer at contract inception we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are distinct performance obligations we then assess whether we act as an agent or a principal for each identified performance obligation and include revenue within the transaction price for thirdparty costs when we determine that we act as principal 

net revenue primarily consisting of fees commissions and performance incentives represents the amount of our gross billings excluding billable expenses charged to a client generally our compensation is based on a negotiated fixed price rate per hour a retainer commission or volume the majority of our fees are recognized over time as services are performed either utilizing a function of hours incurred and rates per hour as compared to periodically updated estimates to complete or ratably over the term of the contract for certain lessfrequent commissionbased contracts which contain clauses allowing our clients to terminate the arrangement at any time for no compensation revenue is recognized at a point in time typically the date of broadcast or publication 

contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to mutually agreedupon qualitative andor quantitative metrics performance incentives are treated as variable consideration which is estimated at contract inception and included in revenue based on the most likely amount earned out of a range of potential outcomes our estimates are based on a combination of historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment these estimates are updated on a periodic basis and are not expected to result in a reversal of a significant amount of the cumulative revenue recognized 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

the predominant component of billable expenses are thirdparty vendor costs incurred for performance obligations where we have determined that we are acting as principal these thirdparty expenses are generally billed back to our clients billable expenses also includes incidental costs incurred in the performance of our services including airfare mileage hotel stays outoftown meals and telecommunication charges we record these billable expenses within total revenue with a corresponding offset to operating expenses 

in international markets we may receive rebates or credits from vendors based on transactions entered into on behalf of clients rebates and credits are remitted back to our clients in accordance with our contractual requirements or may be retained by us based on the terms of a particular client contract and local law amounts owed back to clients are recorded as a liability and amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned 

in certain international markets our media contracts may allow clients to terminate our arrangement at any time for no compensation to the extent that media has not yet run for those contracts we do not recognize revenue until the media runs which is the point in time at which we have a legally enforceable right to compensation 

performance obligations 

our client contracts may include various goods and services that are capable of being distinct are distinct within the context of the contract and are therefore accounted for as separate performance obligations we allocate revenue to each performance obligation in the contract at inception based on its relative standalone selling price 

our advertising businesses include a wide range of services that involve the creation of an advertising idea concept campaign or marketing strategy in order to promote the client’s brand creative services and to act as an agent to facilitate the production of advertisements by thirdparty suppliers production services” our clients can contract us to perform one or both of these services as they can derive standalone benefit from each production services can include formatting creative material for different media and communication mediums including digital largescale reproduction such as printing and adaptation services talent engagement and acquisition television and radio production and outdoor billboard production our contracts that include both services are typically explicit in the description of which activities constitute the creative advertising services and those that constitute the production services both the creative and production services are sold separately the client can derive utility from each service on its own we do not provide a significant service of integrating these activities into a bundle the services do not significantly modify one another and the services are not highly interrelated or interdependent as such we typically identify two performance obligations in the assessment of our advertising contracts 

our media businesses include services to formulate strategic media plans media planning services and to act as an agent to purchase media eg television and radio spots outdoor advertising digital banners etc from vendors on our clients behalf media buying services our contracts that include both services are typically explicit in the description of which activities constitute the planning services and those that constitute the buying services both the planning and buying services are sold separately the client can derive utility from each service on its own we do not provide a significant service of integrating these activities into a bundle the services do not significantly modify one another and the services are not highly interrelated or interdependent as such we typically identify two performance obligations in the assessment of our media contracts 

our events businesses include creative services related to the conception and planning of custom marketing events as well as activation services which entail the carrying out of the event including but not limited to setup design and staffing additionally our public relations businesses include a broad range of services such as strategic planning social media strategy and the monitoring and development of communication strategies among others while our contracts in these businesses may include some or all of these services we typically identify only one performance obligation in the assessment of our events and public relations contracts as we provide a significant service of integrating the individual services into a combined service for which the customer has contracted 

our data and technology services businesses include data management data and data strategy identity resolution and measurement and analytics products and services while our contracts in these businesses may include some or all of these services we typically identify each product and service as an individual performance obligation 

principal vs agent 

when a thirdparty is involved in the delivery of our services to the client we assess whether or not we are acting as a principal or an agent in the arrangement the assessment is based on whether we control the specified services at any time before they are transferred to the customer we have determined that in our events and public relations businesses we generally act as a principal as our agencies provide a significant service of integrating goods or services provided by third parties into the specified deliverable to our clients in addition we have determined that we are responsible for the performance of the thirdparty suppliers which are combined with our own services before transferring those services to the customer we have also determined that we act as principal when providing creative services and media planning services as we perform a significant 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

integration service in these transactions for performance obligations in which we act as principal we record the gross amount billed to the customer within total revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as billable expenses 

when a thirdparty is involved in the production of an advertising campaign and for media buying services we have determined that we act as the agent and are solely arranging for the thirdparty suppliers to provide services to the customer specifically we do not control the specified services before transferring those services to the customer we are not primarily responsible for the performance of the thirdparty services nor can we redirect those services to fulfill any other contracts we do not have inventory risk or discretion in establishing pricing in our contracts with customers for performance obligations for which we act as the agent we record our revenue as the net amount of our gross billings less amounts remitted to third parties 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes us federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 

we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets which is primarily dependent on future earnings a valuation allowance shall be recognized when based on available evidence it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the factors used in assessing valuation allowances include all available evidence such as past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in circumstances where there is negative evidence establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance conversely a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance further in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings 

the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally guidance is provided for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments we evaluate our tax positions using the “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of october 1 st each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we have 12 reporting units that were subject to the 2020 annual impairment testing our annual impairment review as of october 1 2020 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units 

in performing our annual impairment review we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings financial performance and other relevant entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or clients as well as pending litigation if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

entity is required to determine the fair value and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value otherwise no additional testing is required 

for reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value a quantitative impairment test is performed for our annual impairment test we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units equity to the carrying value of their net assets the sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the quantitative impairment test is failed and impaired goodwill is written down to its fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

for both the 2020 and 2019 annual impairment tests we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for seven reporting units and performed the quantitative impairment test for five reporting units for the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances including financial performance macroeconomic conditions and entityspecific factors such as client wins and losses based on this assessment we have concluded that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value therefore no additional testing was required 

the 2020 and 2019 fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data we generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our analysis for the income approach we used projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth profit margins terminal value growth rates capital expenditures projections assumed tax rates discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management for the market approach we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparablecompany market multiples 

these estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that reporting unit the discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit for the 2020 test the discount rate we used for our reporting units tested ranged between 110 and 130 and the terminal value growth rate was 30 the terminal value growth rate represents the expected longterm growth rate for our industry which incorporates the type of services each reporting unit provides as well as the global economy for the 2020 test the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 30 and 80 factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit we believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period actual results of operations cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation and it is possible that differences and changes could be material a deterioration in profitability adverse market conditions significant client losses changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future 

we also perform a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit where the low end of the range increases discount rates by 05 and the high end of the range decreases discount rates by 05 we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the quantitative impairment test 

the table below displays the midpoint of the fair value range for each reporting unit tested in the 2020 and 2019 annual impairment tests indicating that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units by greater than 20 except for reporting unit b in 2020 whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 150

amounts in millions except per share amounts 



based on the analysis described above for the reporting units for which we performed the quantitative impairment test we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of october 1 2020 because these reporting units passed the test as the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values 

we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups these asset groups are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations we determine our discount rates for our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and significant foreign pension plans based on either a bond selectionsettlement approach or bond yield curve approach using the bond selectionsettlement approach we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments using the bond yield curve approach we determine the discount rate by matching the plans cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve both approaches utilize highquality aarated corporate bonds and the plans projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments which is then used to develop a single discount rate in countries where markets for highquality longterm aa corporate bonds are not well developed a portfolio of longterm government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate 

the discount rate used to calculate net pension and postretirement benefit costs is determined at the beginning of each year for the year ended december 31 2020 discount rates of 335 for the domestic pension plan and 325 for the domestic postretirement benefit plan and a weightedaverage discount rate of 184 for the significant foreign pension plans were used to calculate 2020 net pension and postretirement benefit costs a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the discount rate would not have impacted the 2020 net pension and postretirement benefit cost 

the discou nt rate used to measure our benefit obligations is determined at the end of each year as of december 31 2020 we used discount rates of 260 for the domestic pension plan and 250 for the domestic postretirement benefit plan and a weightedaverage discount rate of 135 for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the benefit obligation as of december 31 2020 by approximately 280 and 300 respectively 

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions current and expected market conditions risk premiums associated with asset classes and longterm inflation rates we determine both a shortterm and longterm view and then select a longterm rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities 

for 2020 the weightedaverage expected rates of return o f 600 and 470 were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively for 2021 we plan to use expected rates of return of 575 and 447 for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively changes in the rates are typically due to 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held a lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2020 net pension cost by approximately 10

see note 17 in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information on certain accounting standards that have been adopted during 2020 or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations 

nongaap financial measure 

this mda includes both financial measures in accordance with us gaap as well as a nongaap financial measure the nongaap financial measure repre sents net income available to ipg common stockhol der before provision for income taxes total expenses and other incom e equit y in net income loss of unconsolidated a ffiliate s net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and amortization of acquired intangibles which we refer to as “adjusted ebita” 

adjusted ebita should be viewed as supplemental to and not as an alternative for net income available to ipg common stockholders calculated in accordance with us gaap net income or operating income calculated in accordance with us gaap operating income this section also includes reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures as presented below 

adjusted ebita is used by our management as an additional measure of our company’s performance for purposes of business decisionmaking including developing budgets managing expenditures and evaluating potential acquisitions or divestitures periodtoperiod comparisons of adjusted ebita help our management identify additional trends in our company’s financial results that may not be shown solely by periodtoperiod comparisons of net income or operating income in addition we may use adjusted ebita in the incentive compensation programs applicable to some of our employees in order to evaluate our company’s performance our management recognizes that adjusted ebita has inherent limitations because of the excluded items particularly those items that are recurring in nature management also reviews operating income and net income as well as the specific items that are excluded from adjusted ebita but included in net income or operating income as well as trends in those items the amounts of those items are set forth for the applicable periods in the reconciliation of adjusted ebita to net income that accompany our disclosure documents containing nongaap financial measures including the reconciliations contained in this mda 

we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebita is useful to investors in their analysis of our results for reasons similar to the reasons why our management finds it useful and because it helps facilitate investor understanding of decisions made by management in light of the performance metrics used in making those decisions in addition as more fully described below we believe that providing adjusted ebita together with a reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure to net income helps investors make comparisons between our company and other companies that may have different capital structures different effective income tax rates and tax attributes different capitalized asset values andor different forms of employee compensation however adjusted ebita is intended to provide a supplemental way of comparing our company with other public companies and is not intended as a substitute for comparisons based on net income or operating income in making any comparisons to other companies investors need to be aware that companies may use different nongaap measures to evaluate their financial performance investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measures and the corresponding us gaap measures provided by each company under the applicable rules of the us securities and exchange commission 

the following is an explanation of the items excluded by us from adjusted ebita but included in net income 

  

• total expense and other income provision for income taxes equity in net income loss of unconsolidated affiliates and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests we exclude these items i because these items are not directly attributable to the performance of our business operations and accordingly their exclusion assists management and investors in making periodtoperiod comparisons of operating performance and ii to assist management and investors in making comparisons to companies with different capital structures investors should note that these items will recur in future periods 

• amortization of acquired intangibles  amortization of acquired intangibles is a noncash expense relating to intangible assets arising from acquisitions that are expensed on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the related assets we exclude amortization of acquired intangibles because we believe that i the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

and ii such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of new acquisitions and full amortization of previously acquired intangible assets accordingly we believe that this exclusion assists management and investors in making periodtoperiod comparisons of operating performance investors should note that the use of acquired intangible assets contributed to revenue in the periods presented and will contribute to future revenue generation and should also note that such expense may recur in future periods

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

amounts in millions 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items from time to time we use derivative instruments pursuant to established guidelines and policies to manage some portion of these risks derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rates 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations the majority of our debt approximately 97 as of both december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively bears interest at fixed rates we do have debt with variable interest rates but a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a 10 change in interest rates is summarized below 



we had 25109 of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2020 that we generally invest in conservative shortterm bank deposits or securities the interest income generated primarily from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements during 2020 and 2019 we had interest income of 295 and 345 respectively based on our 2020 results a 100 basispoint increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately 251 assuming that all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from yearend 2020 levels 

foreign currency rates 

we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations the foreign currencies that most adversely impacted our results during the year ended december 31 2020 were the brazilian real and argentine peso based on 2020 exchange rates and operating results if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10 we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 2 assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2020 levels 

the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency mitigating transaction risk however certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and other direct expenses we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges or net investment hedges to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes 

we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period if this occurs the functional currency of that country is changed to our reporting currency the us dollar and foreign exchange gains or losses are recognized on all monetary transactions assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary 

credit and market risks 

balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities accounts receivable and accounts receivable billable to clients we invest our cash primarily in investmentgrade shortterm securities and bank deposits and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for expected credit losses based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 

our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods

sources of revenue 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world our revenues are directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients and our ability to win new clients most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 30 to 90 days although our data management contracts typically have noncancelable terms of more than one year 

revenues for the creation and production of advertising or the planning and placement of media are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided 

we also generate revenue from data and technology offerings and in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion event marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients as is customary in the advertising and marketing industries to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients and in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor in these arrangements 

our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter

our large and diverse client base includes many of the most recognizable companies and brands throughout the world our holding company structure allows us to maintain a diversified client base across and within a full range of industry sectors in the aggregate our top ten clients based on net revenue accounted for approximately 17 of net revenue in 2019 and 18 in 2018  our largest client accounted for approximately 3 of net revenue in 2019 and 4 of net revenue in 2018  based on net revenue for the year ended december 31 2019  our largest client sectors in alphabetical order were auto and transportation healthcare and technology and telecom we represent several different clients brands or divisions within each of these sectors in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency brands representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency and a client may change its marketing budget at any time 

we operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry our operating companies compete against other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies and new forms of market participants to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships 

regulatory environment 

the advertising and marketing services that our agencies provide are subject to governmental regulation and other action in all of the jurisdictions in which the company operates while these governmental regulations and other actions can impact the company’s operations the specific marketing regulations we may face in a given market do not as a general matter significantly impact the company’s overall service offerings or the nature in which we provide these services 

governments government agencies and industry selfregulatory bodies have adopted laws regulations and standards and judicial bodies have issued rulings that directly or indirectly affect the form and content of advertising public relations and other marketing activities we produce or conduct on behalf of our clients these laws regulations and other actions include contentrelated rules with respect to specific products and services restrictions on media scheduling and placement and labeling or warning requirements with respect to certain products for example pharmaceuticals alcoholic beverages cigarettes and other tobacco products and food and nutritional supplements we are also subject to rules related to marketing directed to certain groups such as children

with agencies and clients located in over 100 countries worldwide we are also subject to laws governing our international operations these include broad anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery act 2010 which generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to government officials and political figures export controls and economic sanctions regimes such as those maintained by the us government and comparable ones by the uk the member states of the european union and the un impose limitations on the company’s ability to operate in certain geographic regions or to seek or service certain potential clients likewise our treasury operations must comply with exchange controls restrictions on currency repatriation and the control requirements of applicable antimoneylaundering statutes 

personnel 

as of december 31 2019  we employed approximately 54300 people of whom approximately 22400 were employed in the united states because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success we conduct extensive employee training and development throughout our agencies and benchmark our compensation programs against those of our industry for their competitiveness and effectiveness in recruitment and retention there is keen competition for qualified employees

risk factors 

tableend

we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition see also statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive and constantly changing our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and other providers of creative marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants 

competitive challenges also arise from rapidlyevolving and new technologies in the marketing and advertising space creating opportunities for new and existing competitors and a need for continued significant investment in tools technologies and process improvements as datadriven marketing solutions become increasingly core to the success of our brands any failure to keep up with rapidly changing technologies and standards in this space could harm our competitive position 

the client’s perception of the quality of our agencies’ creative work its confidence in our ability to protect the confidentiality of their and their customers’ data and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services and technologies may also be an important competitive consideration on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people and freedom of entry into the industry is almost unlimited our relationships with clients can be affected by the departure of key personnel and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

 many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time and we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions our clients may choose to terminate their contracts or reduce their relationships with us on a relatively short time frame and for any reason a relatively small number of clients contribute a significant portion of our revenue in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 17 of revenue in 2019  a substantial decline in a large client’s advertising and marketing spending or the loss of a significant part of its business could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 

our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest or our own exclusivity arrangements with certain clients these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

 we are exposed to risks associated with weak or uncertain regional or global economic conditions and disruption in the financial markets the global economy continues to be challenging in some markets uncertainty about the continued strength of the global economy generally or economic conditions in certain regions or market sectors and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers can have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services in addition market conditions can be adversely affected by natural and human disruptions such as natural disasters severe weather events military conflict or public health crises our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general in the past some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses this pattern may recur in the future furthermore unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions or other market disruptions that adversely affect client spending the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations 



our employees including creative digital research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most valuable assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and factors which may be beyond our control changes to us or other immigration policies or travel restrictions imposed as a result of public health political or security concerns that restrain the flow of professional talent may inhibit our ability to staff our offices or projects in addition the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility and significant use of thirdparty or temporary workers to staff new growing or temporary assignments if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients or fail to manage our workforce effectively our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and writeoffs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients and if these effects were severe the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity 

furthermore in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities to the extent possible we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients however if clients are unable to pay for commitments that we have entered into on their behalf or if clients seek to significantly delay or otherwise alter payment terms there could be an adverse effect on our working capital which would negatively impact our operating cash flow 

 we are a global business with agencies located in over 100 countries including every significant world market operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our net revenues approximately 38 in 2019  these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation currency variation exchange control restrictions local labor and employment laws that hinder workforce flexibility largescale local or regional public health crises and other difficult social political or economic conditions we also must comply with applicable us local and other international anticorruption laws including the fcpa and the uk antibribery act 2010 which can be comprehensive complex and stringent in all jurisdictions where we operate certain of which present heightened compliance challenges export controls and economic sanctions such as those maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury can impose limitations on our ability to operate in certain geographic regions or to seek or service certain potential clients these restrictions can place us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to those competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions failure to comply or to implement business practices that sufficiently prevent corruption or violation of sanctions laws could result in significant remediation expense and expose us to significant civil and criminal penalties and reputational harm 

given our substantial operations in the united kingdom and continental europe we face continued uncertainty surrounding the implementation and consequences of the uk’s june 2016 referendum in which voters approved the united kingdom’s exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” under the withdrawal agreement negotiated between the uk and the eu the uk as of january 31 2020 is no longer a member of the european union and a transitional period will occur through december 31 2020 during which the parties intend to negotiate the terms of their future economic and trade relationship during and following this transitional period it is possible that brexit and changes resulting from brexit will cause increased regulatory and legal complexities large exchange rate fluctuations and negative economic impacts these impacts and any increased restrictions on the free movement of labor capital goods and services between the united kingdom and the remaining members of the european union could create uncertainty surrounding our business including our relationships with existing and future clients suppliers and employees and have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations 

in developing countries or regions we may face further risks such as slower receipt of payments nationalization social and economic instability currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries 

in addition because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan renminbi euro and indian rupee fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies including the persistent strength of the us dollar in recent periods may adversely affect our financial results 

 our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation regulation judicial actions or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare our business is also subject to specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products existing and proposed laws and regulations in particular in the european union and the united states concerning user privacy use of personal information and online tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internetbased digital and targeted marketing we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern whether and how we can transfer process or receive certain data that we use in our operations the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of the implementation of new laws or regulations such as the gdpr and the ccpa or changes in interpretations of current ones such as the interpretation of existing consumer protection laws as imposing restrictions on the online collection storage and use of personal data the imposition of restrictions on certain technologies by private market participants in response to privacy concerns could also have a negative impact on our digital business if we are unable to transfer data between countries and regions in which we operate or if we are prohibited from sharing data among our products and services it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results any failure on our part to comply with these legal requirements or their application in an unanticipated manner could harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability legislators agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products such as alcohol tobacco or marijuana products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients’ goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently on our revenues governmental action including judicial rulings on the relative responsibilities of clients and their marketing agencies for the content of their marketing can also impact our operations furthermore we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial 

 we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients such as our acquisition of acxiom in 2018 these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity our forecasts of the investment’s future performance also factor into the initial consideration when actual financial results differ our returns on the investment could be adversely affected 

we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees businesses assets or systems into our organization including with respect to our internal policies and required controls we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investments operations furthermore it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all talent is among our most valuable assets and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel acquisition and integration activity may also divert management’s attention and other corporate resources from other business needs if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

 we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information develop new business opportunities and digital products and process business transactions the incidence of malicious technologyrelated events such as cyberattacks computer hacking computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software phishing attacks and other attempts to gain access to confidential or personal data denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide and highlights the need for continual and effective cybersecurity awareness and education our business which increasingly involves the collection use and transmission of customer data may make us and our agencies attractive targets for malicious thirdparty attempts to access this data power outages equipment failure natural disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis with a large number of agencies and legal entities and the resulting size diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase our potential vulnerability to such breakdowns malicious intrusions or attacks 

likewise data privacy breaches as well as improper use of social media by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data such as personally identifiable information strategic plans and trade secrets could be exposed to third parties or to the general public we operate worldwide and the legal rules governing data transfers are often complex conflicting unclear or everchanging we also utilize third parties including thirdparty “cloud” computing services to store transfer or process data and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business 

any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability be expensive to remedy result in a loss of our or our clients’ or vendors’ proprietary information and damage our reputation efforts to develop implement and maintain security measures are costly may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and cyberattack techniques change frequently or are not recognized until successful and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated 

 we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and fixed assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance 

as of december 31 2019  we have substantial amounts of longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet including approximately 49 billion of goodwill future events including our financial performance market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies loss of a significant client’s business or strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets as well as our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets see critical accounting estimates in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 from time to time we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them see statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 agency operating cash flows have a significant impact on our liquidity and we maintain a commercial paper program a committed corporate credit facility and uncommitted lines of credit to increase flexibility in support of our operating needs if any of these sources were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity and ability to adequately fund our operations could be adversely affected furthermore if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity including in the capital markets there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

under our commercial paper program we are authorized to issue shortterm debt up to an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 15 billion which we use for working capital and general corporate purposes borrowings under the commercial 

paper program are supported by our 15 billion committed corporate credit facility the “credit agreement”  if credit under the credit agreement or our ability to access the commercial paper market were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity could be adversely affected 

the credit agreement contains a leverage ratio and other nonfinancial covenants and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them for example compliance with the financial covenant would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience increased indebtedness or substantially lower revenues including as a result of economic downturns client losses or a substantial increase in client defaults if we were unable to comply with any of the covenants contained in the credit agreement we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders and our costs under these agreements could increase if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver the credit agreement could be terminated any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration and we could lose access to certain uncommitted financing arrangements and commercial paper 

for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook see liquidity and capital resources in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 on october 1 2018 we completed the acquisition of acxiom for approximately 23 billion including customary closing adjustments the indebtedness we incurred to fund the acxiom acquisition significantly increased our outstanding debt levels and will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to servicing this debt as of december 31 2019 10 billion of this indebtedness matures within two years if we are unable to generate sufficient funds to meet our obligations under our credit facilities or the debt securities we issued in connection with the acquisition we may be required to refinance restructure or otherwise amend some or all of our obligations sell assets or raise additional cash through the sale of our common stock or convertible securities and there could be a negative impact on our credit ratings we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain refinancing on terms as favorable as our current financing or that any restructuring sales of assets or issuances of equity can be accomplished or if accomplished would raise sufficient funds to meet our obligations if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities that issuance could also result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders 

 because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness including covenants and interest rates we could be adversely affected if our credit ratings were downgraded or if they were significantly weaker than those of our competitors our access to the commercial paper market is contingent on our maintenance of sufficient shortterm debt ratings and any downgrades to those ratings could increase our borrowing costs and reduce the market capacity for or our ability to issue commercial paper our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

 as a non–location–specific non–manufacturing service business we have to date been sheltered from or able to mitigate many direct impacts from climate change and related laws and regulations we are however increasingly impacted by the effects of climate change and laws and regulations related to other sustainability concerns and we could incur related costs indirectly through our clients increasingly our clients request that we comply with their own social responsibility sustainability or other business policies or standards which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations before they commence or continue doing business with us and sustainability and governance issues are increasingly a focus of the investor community our compliance with these policies and related certification requirements could be costly and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business relationships or reputation if large shareholders were to reduce their ownership stakes in our company as a result of dissatisfaction with our policies or efforts in this area there could be negative impact on our stock price and we could also suffer reputational harm further if clients’ costs are adversely affected by climate change or related laws and regulations this could negatively impact their spending on our advertising and marketing services we could also face increased prices from our own suppliers that face climate changerelated costs and seek to pass on their increased costs to their customers

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help you understand the interpublic group of companies inc and its subsidiaries the company ipg we us or our mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this report our mda includes the following sections 

executive summary provides a discussion about our strategic outlook factors influencing our business and an overview of our results of operations and liquidity 

results of operations provides an analysis of the consolidated and segment results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018 and 2018 compared to 2017  

liquidity and capital resources provides an overview of our cash flows funding requirements contractual obligations financing and sources of funds and debt credit ratings 

critical accounting estimates provides a discussion of our accounting policies that require critical judgment assumptions and estimates 

recent accounting standards by reference to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements provides a discussion of certain accounting standards that have been adopted during 2019 or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations 

nongaap financial measure provides a reconciliation of nongaap financial measure with the most directly comparable generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap financial measures and sets forth the reasons we believe that presentation of the nongaap financial measure contained therein provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and financial condition 

executive summary 

we are one of the world’s premier global advertising and marketing services companies our companies specialize in consumer advertising digital marketing media planning and buying public relations specialized communications disciplines and data management our agencies create customized marketing programs for clients that range in scale from large global marketers to regional and local clients comprehensive global services are critical to effectively serve our multinational and local clients in markets throughout the world as they seek to build brands increase sales of their products and services and gain market share 

we operate in a media landscape that continues to evolve at a rapid pace media channels continue to fragment and clients face an increasingly complex consumer environment to stay ahead of these challenges and to achieve our objectives we have made and continue to make investments in creative strategic and technology talent in areas including fastgrowth digital marketing channels highgrowth geographic regions and strategic world markets we consistently review opportunities within our company to enhance our operations through acquisitions and strategic alliances and internal programs that encourage intracompany collaboration as appropriate we also develop relationships with technology and emerging media companies that are building leadingedge marketing tools that complement our agencies skill sets and capabilities 

our financial goals include competitive organic net revenue growth and expansion of ebita margin as defined and discussed within the nongaap financial measure section of this mda which we expect will further strengthen our balance sheet and total liquidity and increase value to our shareholders accordingly we remain focused on meeting the evolving needs of our clients while concurrently managing our cost structure we continually seek greater efficiency in the delivery of our services focusing on more effective resource utilization including the productivity of our employees real estate information technology and shared services such as finance human resources and legal the improvements we have made and continue to make in our financial reporting and business information systems in recent years allow us more timely and actionable insights from our global operations our disciplined approach to our balance sheet and liquidity provides us with a solid financial foundation and financial flexibility to manage and grow our business we believe that our strategy and execution position us to meet our financial goals and to deliver longterm shareholder value 

when we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the remainder we call organic change which indicates how our underlying business performed we exclude the impact of billable expenses in analyzing our operating performance as the fluctuations from period to period are not indicative of the performance of our underlying businesses and have no impact on our operating income or net income 

the change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the priorperiod reported results using the currentperiod exchange rates and comparing these priorperiod adjusted amounts to the priorperiod reported results although the us dollar is our reporting currency a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

are generated in foreign currencies therefore our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar affect our consolidated results of operations and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact to our operations related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region the foreign currencies that most adversely impacted our results during the year ended december 31 2019 were the british pound sterling and euro 

for purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred during the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan 

the metrics that we use to evaluate our financial performance include organic change in net revenue as well as the change in certain operating expenses and the components thereof expressed as a percentage of consolidated net revenue as well as ebita these metrics are also used by management to assess the financial performance of our reportable segments integrated agency networks ian and constituency management group cmg in certain of our discussions we analyze net revenue by geographic region and by business sector in which we focus on our top 100 clients which typically constitute approximately 55 to 60 of our annual consolidated net revenues

 our organic net revenue increase of 33 for the year ended december 31 2019 was driven by growth across nearly all geographic regions attributable to a combination of net higher spending from existing clients and net client wins most notably in the healthcare financial services technology and telecom and retail sectors partially offset by a decrease in the auto and transportation sector during the year ended december 31 2019  our ebita margin on net revenue grew to 136 from 130 in the prioryear period as the increase in net revenue outpaced the overall increase in our operating expense excluding billable expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles

consolidated results of operations 

net revenue 

our net revenue is directly impacted by the retention and spending levels of existing clients and by our ability to win new clients most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue our net revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter reflecting the seasonal spending of our clients 



the organic increase in our domestic market was primarily driven by growth at our advertising and media businesses as well as our data management business in our international markets the organic increase was primarily driven by strong performance at our media businesses throughout all geographic regions in addition the organic increase was also driven by growth at our advertising businesses and our public relations agencies as well as at our digital specialist agencies in latin america consolidated net acquisitions primarily includes net revenue during the first nine months ended september 30 2019 from acxiom which we acquired on october 1 2018 partially offset by divestitures mostly in our domestic market asia pacific and continental europe regions

salaries and related expenses 



net revenue growth of 74 outpaced the increase in salaries and related expenses of 51 during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the prioryear period primarily due to base salaries benefits and tax and temporary help expenses increasing at rates less than net revenue growth the improved ratio was also attributable to the inclusion of acxiom for the full year in 2019  which has a lower ratio of salaries and related expenses as a percentage of its net revenue as well as a result of carefully managing our employee costs 

net revenue growth of 75 outpaced the increase in salaries and related expenses of 62 in 2018 as compared to the prioryear period primarily driven by leverage in base salaries benefits and tax partially offset by higher incentive expense as a result of improved financial performance and higher temporary help to support business growth the acquisition of acxiom completed on october 1 2018 did not have a significant impact on the ratios presented above

office and other direct expenses 





 office and other direct expenses increased by 154 compared to net revenue growth of 74 during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the prioryear period the increase in office and other direct expenses was mainly due to the inclusion of acxiom for the full year in 2019  which has a higher ratio of office and other direct expenses as a percentage of its net revenue primarily driven by client service costs and professional fees additionally contributing to the increase was a yearoveryear change in contingent acquisition obligations partially offset by leverage on occupancy expense 

net revenue growth of 75 outpaced the increase in office and other direct expenses of 68 in 2018 as compared to the prioryear period primarily driven by leverage in occupancy expense partially offset by an increase in client service costs from acxiom and yearoveryear change in contingent acquisition obligations 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses sga are primarily the unallocated expenses of our corporate as detailed further in the segment discussion later in this mda excluding depreciation and amortization sga as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 11 in 2019 from 21 in the prioryear period primarily attributable to lower professional fees mainly driven by transaction costs related to the acxiom acquisition in 2018 and an increase in allocated service fees from selling general and administrative expenses to cost of services mainly as a result of the inclusion of acxiom sga as a percentage of net revenue increased to 21 in 2018 from 16 in 2017  primarily as a result of transaction costs related to the acxiom acquisition and higher incentive expense 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net revenue was 32 in 2019  25 in 2018 and 21 in 2017  the increases in both 2019 and 2018 compared to prioryear periods were primarily due to the inclusion of acxiom for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  amortization of acquired intangibles was 860  376 and 211  respectively 

restructuring charges 

in the first quarter of 2019 the company implemented a cost initiative the “2019 plan” to better align our cost structure with our revenue primarily related to specific client losses occurring in 2018 the components of which are listed below all restructuring actions were substantially completed by the end of the second quarter of 2019 and we dont expect any further restructuring adjustments to the 2019 plan

expenses and other income 



net interest expense 

for 2019  net interest expense increased by 636 as compared to 2018  primarily attributable to increased cash interest expense from the issuance of 25000 of longterm debt in september and october of 2018 in order to finance the acquisition of acxiom partially offset by an increase in interest income primarily due to higher cash balances in international markets for 2018  net interest expense increased by 298 as compared to 2017  primarily attributable to increased cash interest expense from the issuance of longterm debt in 2018 as well as increased shortterm borrowings and higher interest rates throughout the year this was partially offset by decreased noncash interest expense from revaluations of mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests

income taxes

effective tax rate 

our tax rates are affected by many factors including our worldwide earnings from various countries changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income in 2019  our effective income tax rate of 233 was positively impacted by the reversal of valuation allowances primarily in continental europe by the settlement of state income tax audits and by excess tax benefits on employee sharebased paymentsthe effective tax rate was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances net losses on sales of businesses and the classification of certain assets as held for sale for which we received minimal tax benefit 

in 2018  our effective income tax rate of 238 was positively impacted by us tax incentives foreign tax credits from a distribution of unremitted earnings the net reversal of valuation allowance in continental europe and research and development credits the effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we received no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances nondeductible losses on sales of businesses and assets held for sale by tax expense associated with the change to our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of undistributed earnings attributable to certain foreign subsidiaries and by tax expense related to the trueup of our december 31 2017 tax reform estimates as permitted by sec staff issued accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” 

public law 11597 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was signed into law on december 22 2017 the tax act legislated many new tax provisions which impacted our operations at december 31 2017 provisional amounts were recorded as permitted by sab 118 the impact of the tax act as required by sab 118 resulted in a net tax expense of 134 in 2018 which was primarily attributable to our estimate of the tax imposed on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings 

the company has historically asserted that its unremitted foreign earnings are permanently reinvested and therefore did not record income taxes on such amounts in light of increased debt and associated servicing commitments in connection with the acxiom acquisition that was consummated on october 1 2018 the company reevaluated its global cash needs and as a result determined that approximately 4350 of undistributed foreign earnings from certain international entities were no longer subject to the permanent reinvestment assertion we recorded a tax expense of 108 in 2018 representing our estimate of the tax costs associated with this change to our assertion we did not change our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to any other international entities as we used the related historical earnings and profits to fund international operations and investments 

the tax act imposed a new tax on certain foreign earnings generated in 2018 and forward these global intangible lowtaxed income gilti tax rules are complex us gaap allows us to choose an accounting policy which treats the us tax under gilti provisions as either a current expense as incurred or as a component of the company’s measurement of deferred taxes the company elected to account for the gilti tax as a current expense 

in 2017  our effective income tax rate of 323 was positively impacted by a net benefit of 360 as a result of the tax act as well as excess tax benefits on employee sharebased payments partially offset by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances

operating activities 

due to the seasonality of our business we typically use cash from working capital in the first nine months of a year with the largest impact in the first quarter and generate cash from working capital in the fourth quarter driven by the seasonally strong media spending by our clients quarterly and annual working capital results are impacted by the fluctuating annual media spending budgets of our clients as well as their changing media spending patterns throughout each year across various countries 

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients across various countries affects our working capital and operating cash flow and can be volatile in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients the amounts involved which substantially exceed our revenues primarily affect the level of accounts receivable accounts payable accrued liabilities and contract liabilities our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments for example while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2019 was 15292  which was an increase of 9641 as compared to 2018  and the comparison includes 4428 generated from working capital in 2019  compared with 4311 used in working capital in 2018  working capital in 2019 was primarily impacted by the variation in the timing of collections and payments around the reporting period of which the timing that was unfavorable in late 2018 compared to 2017 was a benefit in 2019 as well as the spending levels and pattern of our clients as compared to 2018  

net cash provided by operating activities during 2018 was 5651  which was a decrease of 3167 as compared to 2017  primarily as a result of an increase in working capital usage of 4364  working capital in 2018 was impacted by the spending levels of our clients as compared to 2017  the working capital usage in both periods was primarily attributable to our media businesses 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during 2019 consisted primarily of payments for capital expenditures of 1985  related mostly to leasehold improvements and computer hardware and software 

net cash used in investing activities during 2018 consisted of payments for acquisitions of 23098  related mostly to the acquisition of acxiom and payments for capital expenditures of 1771  related mostly to leasehold improvements and computer hardware and software 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during 2019 was driven by repayment of longterm debt of 4033 and the payment of dividends of 3631  

net cash provided by financing activities during 2018 was driven by net proceeds from longterm debt of 24942 primarily to finance the acquisition of acxiom partially offset by the payment of dividends of 3221  the repurchase of 51 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 1171  including fees and the repayment of longterm debt of 1048  

foreign exchange rate changes 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a net decrease of 60 in 2019  

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a net decrease of 473 in 2018  the decrease was primarily a result of the us dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies including the australian dollar south african rand and indian rupee as of december 31 2018 compared to december 31 2017

liquidity outlook 

we expect our cash flow from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months we also have a commercial paper program a committed corporate credit facility and uncommitted lines of credit to support our operating needs borrowings under our commercial paper program are supported by our committed credit agreement we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity with flexibility over significant uses of cash including our capital expenditures cash used for new acquisitions our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends 

from time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional funds or otherwise improve our liquidity profile enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors which include those specific to us such as our credit ratings and those related to the financial markets such as the amount or terms of available credit there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity or continue to access existing sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

funding requirements 

our most significant funding requirements include our operations noncancelable operating lease obligations capital expenditures acquisitions common stock dividends taxes and debt service additionally we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests

share repurchase program 

on july 2 2018 in connection with the announcement of the acxiom acquisition we announced that share repurchases will be suspended for a period of time in order to reduce the increased debt levels incurred in conjunction with the acquisition as of december 31 2019  3384  excluding fees remains available for repurchase under the share repurchase programs there is no expiration date associated with the share repurchase programs 

financing and sources of funds 

substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries 

at december 31 2019  we held 3236 of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in foreign subsidiaries the company has historically asserted that its unremitted foreign earnings are permanently reinvested and therefore has not recorded any deferred taxes on such amounts during the third quarter ended september 30 2018 the company reevaluated its global cash needs and as a result determined that approximately 4350 of undistributed foreign earnings from certain international entities were no longer subject to the permanent reinvestment assertion of which 1554 remains undistributed as of december 31 2019 we have not changed our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to any other international entities as we intend to use the related historical earnings and profits to fund international operations and investments 

credit agreements 

we maintain a committed corporate credit facility originally dated as of july 18 2008 which has been amended and restated from time to time the credit agreement we use our credit agreement to increase our financial flexibility to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries and to support our commercial paper program on november 1 2019 we amended and restated the amendment the credit agreement under the amendment among other things the maturity date of the credit agreement was extended to november 1 2024 and the cost structure of the credit agreement was changed the amendment also removed the interest coverage ratio financial covenant however the company remains subject to the leverage ratio financial covenant among other customary covenants at the election of the company the leverage ratio financial covenant may be changed to not more than 400 to 100 for four consecutive fiscal quarters beginning with the fiscal quarter in which there is an occurrence of one or more acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of at least 2000  

the credit agreement is a revolving facility under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 15000  or the equivalent in other currencies the company has the ability to increase the commitments under the credit agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to 2500  provided the company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase subject to a sublimit of 500  or the equivalent in other currencies our obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured as of december 31 2019  there were

no borrowings under the credit agreement however we had 84 of letters of credit under the credit agreement which reduced our total availability to 14916  

under the credit agreement we can elect to receive advances bearing interest based on either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate each as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin that is determined based on our credit ratings as of december 31 2019  the applicable margin was 0125 for base rate advances and 1125 for eurocurrency rate borrowings letter of credit fees accrue on the average daily aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at a rate equal to the applicable margin for eurocurrency rate advances and fronting fees accrue on the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at an annual rate of 025  we also pay a facility fee on each lenders revolving commitment of 0125  which is an annual rate determined based on our credit ratings 

the table below sets forth the financial covenant in effect as of december 31 2019  which applies to the credit agreement 





 

as of december 31 2019  we were in compliance with our covenants in the credit agreement if we were unable to comply with our covenants in the future we would seek an amendment or waiver from the applicable lenders but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver if we were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver these facilities could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal in addition under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit agreement 

we also have uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates and that are primarily used to fund working capital needs we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some of our operations as of december 31 2019  the company had uncommitted lines of credit in an aggregate amount of 10560  under which we had outstanding borrowings of 524 classified as shortterm borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet the average amount outstanding during 2019 was 880  with a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 52  

commercial paper 

the company is authorized to issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 15000  borrowings under the commercial paper program are supported by the credit agreement described above proceeds of the commercial paper are used for working capital and general corporate purposes including the repayment of maturing indebtedness and other shortterm liquidity needs the maturities of the commercial paper vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue as of december 31 2019  there was no commercial paper outstanding the average amount outstanding under the program was 3129 in 2019  with a weightedaverage interest rate of 25 and a weightedaverage maturity of thirteen days 

cash pooling 

we aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the united states we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several ipg agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all agencies does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of bank overdrafts under all of our pooling arrangements and as of december 31 2019 and 2018 the amounts netted were 22749 and 20658  respectively

debt credit ratings 

our debt credit ratings as of february 13 2020 are listed below 



a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity either adverse or favorable because among other things they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise for example our credit agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid and our access to the commercial paper market is contingent on our maintenance of sufficient shortterm debt ratings 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our consolidated financial statements management has discussed with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the basis on which we earn fees and commissions vary significantly our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 30 to 90 days although our data management contracts typically have noncancelable terms of more than one year our payment terms vary by client and the time between invoicing date and due date is typically not significant we generally have the legally enforceable right to payment for all services provided through the end of the contract or termination date 

we recognize revenue when we determine our customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services to determine revenue recognition we perform the following five steps i identify the contracts with a customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue as or when we satisfy the performance obligation we only apply the fivestep model to contracts when it is probable that ipg will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer at contract inception we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are distinct performance obligations we then assess whether we act as an agent or a principal for each identified performance obligation and include revenue within the transaction price for thirdparty costs when we determine that we act as principal 

net revenue primarily consisting of fees commissions and performance incentives represents the amount of our gross billings excluding billable expenses charged to a client generally our compensation is based on a negotiated fixed price rate per hour a retainer commission or volume the majority of our fees are recognized over time as services are performed either utilizing a function of hours incurred and rates per hour as compared to periodically updated estimates to complete or ratably over the term of the contract for certain lessfrequent commissionbased contracts which contain clauses allowing our clients to terminate the arrangement at any time for no compensation revenue is recognized at a point in time typically the date of broadcast or publication 

contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to mutually agreedupon qualitative andor quantitative metrics performance incentives are treated as variable consideration which is estimated at contract inception and included in revenue based on the most likely amount earned out of a range of potential outcomes our estimates are based on a combination of historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment these estimates are updated on a periodic basis and are not expected to result in a reversal of a significant amount of the cumulative revenue recognized 

the predominant component of billable expenses are thirdparty vendor costs incurred for performance obligations where we have determined that we are acting as principal these thirdparty expenses are generally billed back to our clients billable expenses also includes incidental costs incurred in the performance of our services including airfare mileage hotel stays outoftown meals and telecommunication charges we record these billable expenses within total revenue with a corresponding offset to operating expenses 

in international markets we may receive rebates or credits from vendors based on transactions entered into on behalf of clients rebates and credits are remitted back to our clients in accordance with our contractual requirements or may be retained by us based on the terms of a particular client contract and local law amounts owed back to clients are recorded as a liability and amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned 

in certain international markets our media contracts may allow clients to terminate our arrangement at any time for no compensation to the extent that media has not yet run for those contracts we do not recognize revenue until the media runs which is the point in time at which we have a legally enforceable right to compensation 

performance obligations 

our client contracts may include various goods and services that are capable of being distinct are distinct within the context of the contract and are therefore accounted for as separate performance obligations we allocate revenue to each performance obligation in the contract at inception based on its relative standalone selling price 

our advertising businesses include a wide range of services that involve the creation of an advertising idea concept campaign or marketing strategy in order to promote the client’s brand creative services and to act as an agent to facilitate the production of advertisements by thirdparty suppliers production services” our clients can contract us to perform one or both of these services as they can derive standalone benefit from each production services can include formatting creative material for different media and communication mediums including digital largescale reproduction such as printing and adaptation services talent

engagement and acquisition television and radio production and outdoor billboard production our contracts that include both services are typically explicit in the description of which activities constitute the creative advertising services and those that constitute the production services both the creative and production services are sold separately the client can derive utility from each service on its own we do not provide a significant service of integrating these activities into a bundle the services do not significantly modify one another and the services are not highly interrelated or interdependent as such we typically identify two performance obligations in the assessment of our advertising contracts 

our media businesses include services to formulate strategic media plans media planning services and to act as an agent to purchase media eg television and radio spots outdoor advertising digital banners etc from vendors on our clients behalf media buying services our contracts that include both services are typically explicit in the description of which activities constitute the planning services and those that constitute the buying services both the planning and buying services are sold separately the client can derive utility from each service on its own we do not provide a significant service of integrating these activities into a bundle the services do not significantly modify one another and the services are not highly interrelated or interdependent as such we typically identify two performance obligations in the assessment of our media contracts 

our events businesses include creative services related to the conception and planning of custom marketing events as well as activation services which entail the carrying out of the event including but not limited to setup design and staffing additionally our public relations businesses include a broad range of services such as strategic planning social media strategy and the monitoring and development of communication strategies among others while our contracts in these businesses may include some or all of these services we typically identify only one performance obligation in the assessment of our events and public relations contracts as we provide a significant service of integrating the individual services into a combined service for which the customer has contracted 

our data and technology services businesses include data management data and data strategy identity resolution and measurement and analytics products and services while our contracts in these businesses may include some or all of these services we typically identify each product and service as an individual performance obligation 

principal vs agent 

when a thirdparty is involved in the delivery of our services to the client we assess whether or not we are acting as a principal or an agent in the arrangement the assessment is based on whether we control the specified services at any time before they are transferred to the customer we have determined that in our events and public relations businesses we generally act as a principal as our agencies provide a significant service of integrating goods or services provided by third parties into the specified deliverable to our clients in addition we have determined that we are responsible for the performance of the thirdparty suppliers which are combined with our own services before transferring those services to the customer we have also determined that we act as principal when providing creative services and media planning services as we perform a significant integration service in these transactions for performance obligations in which we act as principal we record the gross amount billed to the customer within total revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as billable expenses 

when a thirdparty is involved in the production of an advertising campaign and for media buying services we have determined that we act as the agent and are solely arranging for the thirdparty suppliers to provide services to the customer specifically we do not control the specified services before transferring those services to the customer we are not primarily responsible for the performance of the thirdparty services nor can we redirect those services to fulfill any other contracts we do not have inventory risk or discretion in establishing pricing in our contracts with customers for performance obligations for which we act as the agent we record our revenue as the net amount of our gross billings less amounts remitted to third parties 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes us federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 

we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets which is primarily dependent on future earnings a valuation allowance shall be recognized when based on available evidence it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the factors used in assessing valuation allowances include all available evidence such as past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in circumstances where there is negative evidence establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

conversely a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance further in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings 

the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally guidance is provided for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments we evaluate our tax positions using the “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of october 1 st each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we have 12 reporting units that were subject to the 2019 annual impairment testing our annual impairment review as of october 1 2019 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units 

in performing our annual impairment review we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings financial performance and other relevant entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or clients as well as pending litigation if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the entity is required to determine the fair value and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value otherwise no additional testing is required 

for reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value a quantitative impairment test is performed for our annual impairment test we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units equity to the carrying value of their net assets the sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the quantitative impairment test is failed and impaired goodwill is written down to its fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

for our 2019 and 2018 annual impairment tests we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for seven and ten reporting units and performed the quantitative impairment test for five and three reporting units respectively for the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances including financial performance macroeconomic conditions and entityspecific factors such as client wins and losses based on this assessment we have concluded that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value therefore no additional testing was required 

the 2019 and 2018 fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data we generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our analysis for the income approach we used projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth profit margins terminal value growth rates capital expenditures projections assumed tax rates discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management for the market approach we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparablecompany market multiples 

these estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that reporting unit the discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit for the 2019 test the discount rate we used for our reporting units tested ranged between 105 and 115  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

and the terminal value growth rate was 30  the terminal value growth rate represents the expected longterm growth rate for our industry which incorporates the type of services each reporting unit provides as well as the global economy for the 2019 test the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 30 and 90  factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit we believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period actual results of operations cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation and it is possible that differences and changes could be material a deterioration in profitability adverse market conditions significant client losses changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future 

we also perform a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit where the low end of the range increases discount rates by 05 and the high end of the range decreases discount rates by 05 we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the quantitative impairment test 

the table below displays the midpoint of the fair value range for each reporting unit tested in the 2019 and 2018 annual impairment tests indicating that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units by greater than 20 



based on the analysis described above for the reporting units for which we performed the quantitative impairment test we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of october 1 2019  because these reporting units passed the test as the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values 

we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups these asset groups are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations we determine our discount rates for our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and significant foreign pension plans based on either a bond selectionsettlement approach or bond yield curve approach using the bond selectionsettlement approach we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments using the bond yield curve approach we determine the discount rate by matching the plans cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve both approaches utilize highquality aarated corporate bonds and the plans projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments which is then used to develop a single discount rate in countries where markets for highquality longterm aa corporate bonds are not well developed a portfolio of longterm government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate 

the discount rate used to calculate net pension and postretirement benefit costs is determined at the beginning of each year for the year ended december 31 2019  discount rates of 435 for the domestic pension plan and 430 for the domestic 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

postretirement benefit plan and a weightedaverage discount rate of 261 for the significant foreign pension plans were used to calculate 2019 net pension and postretirement benefit costs a 25 basispoint increase in the discount rate would have decreased the 2019 net pension and postretirement benefit cost by 01  a 25 basispoint decrease in the discount rate would not have impacted our net pension and postretirement benefit cost 

the discount rate used to measure our benefit obligations is determined at the end of each year as of december 31 2019  we used discount rates of 335 for the domestic pension plan and 325 for the domestic postretirement benefit plan and a weightedaverage discount rate of 184 for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the december 31 2019 benefit obligation by approximately 250 and 260  respectively 

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions current and expected market conditions risk premiums associated with asset classes and longterm inflation rates we determine both a shortterm and longterm view and then select a longterm rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities 

for 2019  the weightedaverage expected rates of return of 700 and 476 were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively for 2020  we plan to use expected rates of return of 600 and 470 for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held a lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2019 net pension cost by approximately 10  

recent accounting standards 

see note 17 in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data for further information on certain accounting standards that have been adopted during 2019 or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations 

nongaap financial measure 

this mda includes both financial measures in accordance with us gaap as well as a nongaap financial measure the nongaap financial measure represents net income available to ipg common stockholder before provision for income taxes total expenses and other income equity in net income loss of unconsolidated affiliates net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and amortization of acquired intangibles which we refer to as “ebita” 

ebita should be viewed as supplemental to and not as an alternative for net income available to ipg common stockholders calculated in accordance with us gaap net income or operating income calculated in accordance with us gaap operating income this section also includes reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures as presented below 

ebita is used by our management as an additional measure of our company’s performance for purposes of business decisionmaking including developing budgets managing expenditures and evaluating potential acquisitions or divestitures periodtoperiod comparisons of ebita help our management identify additional trends in our company’s financial results that may not be shown solely by periodtoperiod comparisons of net income or operating income in addition we may use ebita in the incentive compensation programs applicable to some of our employees in order to evaluate our company’s performance our management recognizes that ebita has inherent limitations because of the excluded items particularly those items that are recurring in nature management also reviews operating income and net income as well as the specific items that are excluded from ebita but included in net income or operating income as well as trends in those items the amounts of those items are set forth for the applicable periods in the reconciliation of ebita to net income that accompany our disclosure documents containing nongaap financial measures including the reconciliations contained in this mda 

we believe that the presentation of ebita is useful to investors in their analysis of our results for reasons similar to the reasons why our management finds it useful and because it helps facilitate investor understanding of decisions made by management in light of the performance metrics used in making those decisions in addition as more fully described below we believe that providing ebita together with a reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure to net income helps investors make comparisons between our company and other companies that may have different capital structures different effective income tax rates and tax attributes different capitalized asset values andor different forms of employee compensation however ebita is intended to provide a supplemental way of comparing our company with other public companies and is not intended as a substitute

for comparisons based on net income or operating income in making any comparisons to other companies investors need to be aware that companies may use different nongaap measures to evaluate their financial performance investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measures and the corresponding us gaap measures provided by each company under the applicable rules of the us securities and exchange commission 

the following is an explanation of the items excluded by us from ebita but included in net income

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

amounts in millions 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items from time to time we use derivative instruments pursuant to established guidelines and policies to manage some portion of these risks derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rates 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations the majority of our debt approximately 97 and 86 as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively bears interest at fixed rates we do have debt with variable interest rates but a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a 10 change in interest rates is summarized below 



we had 11922 of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2019 that we generally invest in conservative shortterm bank deposits or securities the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements during 2019 and 2018  we had interest income of 345 and 218  respectively based on our 2019 results a 100 basispoint increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately 119  assuming that all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from yearend 2019 levels 

foreign currency rates 

we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations the foreign currencies that most adversely impacted our results during the year ended december 31 2019 were the british pound sterling and euro based on 2019 exchange rates and operating results if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10 we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4  assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2019 levels 

the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency mitigating transaction risk however certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and other direct expenses we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges or net investment hedges to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes 

we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period if this occurs the functional currency of that country is changed to our reporting currency the us dollar and foreign exchange gains or losses are recognized on all monetary transactions assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary 

credit and market risks 

balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities accounts receivable and accounts receivable billable to clients we invest our cash primarily in investmentgrade shortterm securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 

our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods

ipg and our agencies are committed to diversity and inclusion and we reinforce these values through a comprehensive set of awardwinning programs these include business resource groups that develop career building programs as well as training around topics like unconscious bias we seek to ensure accountability by tying executive compensation directly to the ability of our leaders to hire promote and retain diverse talent and we regularly measure the inclusiveness of our culture with a companywide climate for inclusion survey

acquisition strategy 

a disciplined acquisition strategy focused on highgrowth capabilities and regions of the world is one component of growing our services in todays rapidlychanging marketing services and media landscape when an outstanding resource or a strong tactical fit becomes available we have been opportunistic over the years in making tuckin niche acquisitions that enhance our service offerings

sources of revenue 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world our revenues are directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients and our ability to win new clients most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 90 days or less 

revenues for the creation and production of advertising or the planning and placement of media are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided 

we also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion event marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients as is customary in the advertising and marketing industries to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients and in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor in these arrangements 

our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter 





 

clients 

our large and diverse client base includes many of the most recognizable companies and brands throughout the world our holding company structure allows us to maintain a diversified client base across and within a full range of industry sectors in the aggregate our top ten clients based on net revenue accounted for approximately 18  of net revenue in 2018  and 20  in 2017  our largest client accounted for approximately 4  of net revenue for both 2018  and 2017  based on net revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  our largest client sectors in alphabetical order were auto and transportation healthcare and technology and telecom we represent several different clients brands or divisions within each of these sectors in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency brands representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time 

we operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry our operating companies compete against other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies and new forms of market participants to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships 

regulatory environment 

the advertising and marketing services that our agencies provide are subject to governmental regulation and other action in all of the jurisdictions in which the company operates while these governmental regulations and other actions can impact the company’s operations the specific marketing regulations we may face in a given market do not as a general matter significantly impact the company’s overall service offerings or the nature in which we provide these services 

governments government agencies and industry selfregulatory bodies have adopted laws regulations and standards and judicial bodies have issued rulings that directly or indirectly affect the form and content of advertising public relations and other marketing activities we produce or conduct on behalf of our clients these laws regulations and other actions include contentrelated rules with respect to specific products and services restrictions on media scheduling and placement and labeling or warning requirements with respect to certain products for example pharmaceuticals alcoholic beverages cigarettes and other tobacco products and food and nutritional supplements we are also subject to rules related to marketing directed to certain groups such as children

with agencies and clients located in over 110  countries worldwide we are also subject to laws governing our international operations these include broad anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery 

act 2010 which generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to government officials and political figures export controls and economic sanctions regimes such as those maintained by the us government and comparable ones by the member states of the european union impose limitations on the company’s ability to operate in certain geographic regions or to seek or service certain potential clients likewise our treasury operations must comply with exchange controls restrictions on currency repatriation and the control requirements of applicable antimoneylaundering statutes 

personnel

risk factors 

tableend

we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition see also statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive and constantly changing our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and other providers of creative marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants 

competitive challenges also arise from rapidlyevolving and new technologies in the marketing and advertising space creating opportunities for new and existing competitors and a need for continued significant investment in tools technologies and process improvements as datadriven marketing solutions become increasingly core to the success of our brands any failure to keep up with rapidly changing technologies and standards in this space could harm our competitive position 

the client’s perception of the quality of our agencies’ creative work its confidence in our ability to protect the confidentiality of their and their customers’ data and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services and technologies may also be an important competitive consideration on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people freedom of entry into the industry is almost unlimited and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

 many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time and we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions our clients may choose to terminate their contracts or reduce their relationships with us on a relatively short time frame and for any reason a relatively small number of clients contribute a significant portion of our revenue in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 18  of revenue in 2018  a substantial decline in a large client’s advertising and marketing spending or the loss of a significant part of its business could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 

our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest or our own exclusivity arrangements with certain clients these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

 we are exposed to risks associated with weak or uncertain regional or global economic conditions and increased disruption in the financial markets the global economy continues to be challenging in some markets uncertainty about the continued strength of the global economy generally or economic conditions in certain regions and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers can have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general in the past some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses this pattern may recur in the future furthermore unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations 

 our employees including creative digital research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most valuable assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and factors which may be beyond our control changes to us or other immigration 

policies that restrain the flow of professional talent may inhibit our ability to staff our offices or projects in addition the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility and significant use of thirdparty or temporary workers to staff new growing or temporary assignments if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients or fail to manage our workforce effectively our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and writeoffs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients and if these effects were severe the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity 

furthermore in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities to the extent possible we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients however if clients are unable to pay for commitments that we have entered into on their behalf or if clients seek to significantly delay or otherwise alter payment terms there could be an adverse effect on our working capital which would negatively impact our operating cash flow 

 we are a global business with agencies located in over 110  countries including every significant world market operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues approximately 40  in 2018  these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation currency variation exchange control restrictions local labor and employment laws that hinder workforce flexibility and difficult social political or economic conditions we also must comply with applicable us local and other international anticorruption laws including the fcpa and the uk antibribery act 2010 which can be comprehensive complex and stringent in all jurisdictions where we operate certain of which present heightened compliance challenges export controls and economic sanctions such as those maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury can impose limitations on our ability to operate in certain geographic regions or to seek or service certain potential clients these restrictions can place us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to those competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions failure to comply or to implement business practices that sufficiently prevent corruption or violation of sanctions laws could result in significant remediation expense and expose us to significant civil and criminal penalties and reputational harm 

given our substantial operations in the united kingdom and continental europe we face continued uncertainty surrounding the form and consequences of the implementation of the uk’s june 2016 referendum in which voters approved the united kingdom’s exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” it is possible that brexit and changes resulting from brexit particularly in the event the uk and the european union fail to come to an agreement on the terms of the uk exit will cause increased regulatory and legal complexities and negative economic impacts these impacts and any increased restrictions on the free movement of labor capital goods and services between the united kingdom and the remaining members of the european union could create uncertainty surrounding our business including our relationships with existing and future clients suppliers and employees and have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations 

in developing countries or regions we may face further risks such as slower receipt of payments nationalization social and economic instability currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries 

in addition because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan renminbi euro and indian rupee fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies including the persistent strength of the us dollar in recent periods may adversely affect our financial results in particular brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and the british pound sterling 

 our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation regulation judicial actions or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare our business is also subject to specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products 

existing and proposed laws and regulations in particular in the european union and the united states concerning user privacy use of personal information and online tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internetbased digital and targeted marketing we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern whether and how we can transfer process or receive certain data that we use in our operations the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of the implementation of new laws or regulations such as the gdpr and the ccpa or changes in interpretations of current ones such as the interpretation of existing consumer protection laws as imposing restrictions on the online collection storage and use of personal data if we are unable to transfer data between countries and regions in which we operate or if we are prohibited from sharing data among our products and services it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results any failure on our part to comply with these legal requirements or their application in an unanticipated manner could harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability legislators agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products such as alcohol or tobacco and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients’ goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently on our revenues governmental action including judicial rulings on the relative responsibilities of clients and their marketing agencies for the content of their marketing can also impact our operations furthermore we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial 

 we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients on october 1 2018 we completed the acquisition of acxiom for approximately 23 billion  including customary closing adjustments these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity our forecasts of the investment’s future performance also factor into the initial consideration when actual financial results differ our returns on the investment could be adversely affected 

we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees businesses assets or systems into our organization including with respect to our internal policies and required controls we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investments operations furthermore it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all talent is among our most valuable assets and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel acquisition and integration activity may also divert management’s attention and other corporate resources from other business needs if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

 we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information develop new business opportunities and digital products and process business transactions the incidence of malicious technologyrelated events such as cyberattacks computer hacking computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software phishing attacks and other attempts to gain access to confidential or personal data denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide and highlights the need for continual and effective cybersecurity awareness and education our business which increasingly involves the collection use and transmission of customer data may make us and our agencies attractive targets for malicious thirdparty attempts to access this data power outages equipment failure natural disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis with a large number of agencies and legal entities and the resulting size diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase our potential vulnerability to such breakdowns malicious intrusions or attacks 

likewise data privacy breaches as well as improper use of social media by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data such as personally identifiable information strategic plans and trade secrets could be exposed to third parties or to the general public we operate worldwide and the legal rules governing data transfers are often complex conflicting unclear or everchanging we also utilize third parties including thirdparty “cloud” computing services to store transfer or process data and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business 

any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability be expensive to remedy result in a loss of our or our clients’ or vendors’ proprietary information and damage our reputation efforts to develop implement and maintain security measures are costly may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated 

 we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and fixed assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance 

as of december 31 2018  we have substantial amounts of longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet including approximately 49 billion  of goodwill future events including our financial performance market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies loss of a significant client’s business or strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets as well as our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets see critical accounting estimates  in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 from time to time we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them see statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 we maintain a 15 billion committed corporate credit facility the “credit agreement” to increase our financial flexibility we also maintain a commercial paper program under which we are authorized to issue shortterm debt up to an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 15 billion which we use for working capital and general corporate purposes borrowings under the commercial paper program are supported by the credit agreement if credit under the credit agreement or our ability to access the commercial paper market were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity could be adversely affected 

the credit agreement and the 500 million term loan we entered into to provide financing for the acxiom acquisition the “term loan” each contain financial covenants and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them for example compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement and the term loan we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders and our costs under these agreements could increase if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver the credit agreement and the term loan could be terminated and any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration 

furthermore if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook see liquidity and capital resources  in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 on october 1 2018 we completed the acquisition of acxiom for approximately 23 billion including customary closing adjustments the indebtedness we incurred to fund the acxiom acquisition significantly increased our outstanding debt levels and will require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to servicing this debt as of december 31 2018 14 billion of 

this new indebtedness matures within three years if we are unable to generate sufficient funds to meet our obligations under our credit facilities or the debt securities we issued in connection with the acquisition we may be required to refinance restructure or otherwise amend some or all of our obligations sell assets or raise additional cash through the sale of our common stock or convertible securities we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain refinancing on terms as favorable as our current financing or that any restructuring sales of assets or issuances of equity can be accomplished or if accomplished would raise sufficient funds to meet our obligations if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities that issuance could also result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders 

 because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness including covenants and interest rates we could be adversely affected if our credit ratings were downgraded or if they were significantly weaker than those of our competitors our access to the commercial paper market is contingent on our maintenance of sufficient shortterm debt ratings and any downgrades to those ratings could reduce the market capacity for or our ability to issue commercial paper our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

 although as a nonmanufacturing service business we generally are not directly impacted by current laws and regulations with respect to climate change and other sustainability concerns we could incur related costs indirectly through our clients increasingly our clients request that we comply with their own social responsibility sustainability or other business policies or standards which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations before they commence or continue doing business with us our compliance with these policies and related certification requirements could be costly and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business relationships or reputation further if clients’ costs are adversely affected by climate change or related laws and regulations this could negatively impact their spending on our advertising and marketing services we could also face increased prices from our own suppliers that face climate changerelated costs and that seek to pass on their increased costs to their customers

nongaap financial measure provides a reconciliation of nongaap financial measures with the most directly comparable generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap financial measures and sets forth the reasons we believe that presentation of the nongaap financial measure contained therein provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and financial condition 

executive summary 

we are one of the world’s premier global advertising and marketing services companies our companies specialize in consumer advertising digital marketing media planning and buying public relations and specialized communications disciplines our agencies create customized marketing programs for clients that range in scale from large global marketers to regional and local clients comprehensive global services are critical to effectively serve our multinational and local clients in markets throughout the world as they seek to build brands increase sales of their products and services and gain market share 

we operate in a media landscape that continues to evolve at a rapid pace media channels continue to fragment and clients face an increasingly complex consumer environment to stay ahead of these challenges and to achieve our objectives we have made and continue to make investments in creative and strategic talent in areas including fastgrowth digital marketing channels highgrowth geographic regions and strategic world markets we consistently review opportunities within our company to enhance our operations through acquisitions and strategic alliances and internal programs that encourage intracompany collaboration as appropriate we also develop relationships with technology and emerging media companies that are building leadingedge marketing tools that complement our agencies skill sets and capabilities 

our financial goals include competitive organic net revenue growth and operating margin expansion excluding net interest other expense provision for income taxes and amortization of acquired intangibles which we expect will further strengthen our balance sheet and total liquidity and increase value to our shareholders accordingly we remain focused on meeting the evolving needs of our clients while concurrently managing our cost structure we continually seek greater efficiency in the delivery of our services focusing on more effective resource utilization including the productivity of our employees real estate information technology and shared services such as finance human resources and legal the improvements we have made and continue to make in our financial reporting and business information systems in recent years allow us more timely and actionable insights from our global operations our disciplined approach to our balance sheet and liquidity provides us with a solid financial foundation and financial flexibility to manage and grow our business we believe that our strategy and execution position us to meet our financial goals and to deliver longterm shareholder value 

when we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the remainder we call organic change which indicates how our underlying business performed we exclude the impact of billable expenses in analyzing our operating performance as the fluctuations from period to period are not indicative of the performance of our underlying businesses and have no impact on our operating income or net income 

the change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the priorperiod reported results using the currentperiod exchange rates and comparing these priorperiod adjusted amounts to the priorperiod reported results although the us dollar is our reporting currency a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses

are generated in foreign currencies therefore our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar affect our consolidated results of operations and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact to our operations related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region the foreign currencies that most favorably impacted our results during the year ended december 31   2018  were the euro and british pound sterling the foreign currencies that most adversely impacted our results during the year ended december 31   2018  were the argentine peso and brazilian real 

for purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred during the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan 

on october 1 2018 the closing date pursuant to the terms of the membership interest purchase agreement dated as of july 2 2018 the company completed the acquisition of acxiom holdings inc’s marketing solutions business through the acquisition of 100 of the equity interests of acxiom for 23279  subject to customary closing adjustments the acxiom acquisition the purpose of the acquisition is to combine the companys media creative marketing services and analytics capabilities global scale and consumer insights with acxioms expertise in identity data integrations and data stewardship see note 6  in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  for further detail on the acquisition 

the metrics that we use to evaluate our financial performance include organic change in net revenue as well as the change in certain operating expenses and the components thereof expressed as a percentage of consolidated net revenue ebita as defined and discussed within the nongaap financial measure  section of the mda is an additional measure related to profitability used by management in certain of our discussions we analyze net revenue by geographic region and by business sector in which we focus on our top 100 clients which typically constitute approximately 55 to 60 of our annual consolidated net revenues

the following table presents a summary of our financial performance for the years ended december 31   2018  2017  and 2016  





 our organic net revenue increase of 55  for the year ended december 31   2018  was driven by growth throughout all geographic regions and attributable to a combination of net client wins and net higher spending from existing clients most notably in the healthcare sector partially offset by decreases in the food and beverage sector during the year ended december 31   2018  our operating margin on net revenue remained flat compared to the prioryear period and included 350 of transaction costs and 167 of amortization of acquired intangibles related to the acxiom acquisition 

our restated organic net revenue increase of 15  for the year ended december 31   2017  was driven by growth throughout nearly all geographic regions primarily attributable to a combination of net client wins and net higher spending from existing clients most notably in the healthcare and auto and transportation sectors partially offset by decreases in the financial and technology and telecom sectors during the year ended december 31   2017  our operating margin on net revenue remained flat compared to the prioryear period as a result of the adoption of accounting standards codification topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 see note 1 and 2 in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  for further detail on the asc 606 adoption

consolidated results of operations 

net revenue 

our net revenue is directly impacted by the retention and spending levels of existing clients and by our ability to win new clients most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue our net revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter reflecting the seasonal spending of our clients 



the organic increase in our domestic market was driven by growth across all disciplines most notably at our advertising and media businesses in our international markets the organic increase was driven by growth across all geographic regions and nearly all disciplines primarily at our media and advertising businesses and our digital specialist agencies including strong performance at our advertising businesses in the united kingdom and at our media businesses in the continental europe latin america and united kingdom regions consolidated net acquisitions includes 1817 net revenue from acxiom which we acquired on october 1 2018 



the organic increase in our domestic market was mainly driven by strong growth at our media and advertising businesses partially offset by weakness in our public relations and digital specialist agencies in our international markets the organic revenue increase was primarily driven by growth at our media businesses and public relations agencies across nearly all regions and our advertising businesses in the united kingdom partially offset by decreases at our advertising businesses in the asia pacific and latin america regions and our digital specialist agencies in the united kingdom

salaries and related expenses 



net revenue growth of 75  outpaced the increase in salaries and related expenses of 62  in 2018  as compared to the prioryear period primarily driven by leverage in base salaries benefits and tax partially offset by higher incentive expense as a result of improved financial performance and higher temporary help to support business growth the acxiom acquisition did not have a significant impact on the ratios presented above 

salaries and related expenses increased by 10  compared to net revenue growth of 03  in 2017  as compared to 2016  primarily driven by deleveraging in base salaries benefits and tax partially offset by lower incentive expense and a decrease in acquisitionrelated contractual compensation which is classified within all other salaries and related expenses in the table above 

office and other direct expenses 





 net revenue growth of 75  outpaced the increase in office and other direct expenses of 68  in 2018  as compared to the prioryear period primarily driven by leverage in occupancy expense partially offset by an increase in client service costs from acxiom and yearoveryear change in contingent acquisition obligations 

net revenue growth of 03  outpaced the decrease in office and other direct expenses of 05  in 2017  as compared to 2016  primarily driven by leverage in yearoveryear change in contingent acquisition obligations partially offset by higher occupancy costs 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses sga are primarily the unallocated expenses of our corporate as detailed further in the segment discussion later in this mda excluding depreciation and amortization sga as a percentage of net revenue increased to 21  in 2018  from 16  in the prioryear period primarily as a result of transaction costs related to the acxiom acquisition and higher incentive expense sga as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 16  in 2017 from 19  in 2016  primarily as a result of lower incentive expense

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net revenue increased to 25 in 2018 from 21 in 2017  primarily due to amortization of acquired intangibles from acxiom which we expect to have a material noncash impact going forward estimated to be between 650 and 750 annually depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net revenue remained flat in 2017  as compared to 2016  for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  amortization of acquired intangibles was 376  211  and 219 respectively 

expenses and other income 



net interest expense 

for 2018  net interest expense increased by 298  as compared to 2017  primarily attributable to increased cash interest expense from the issuance of 25000 of longterm debt in september and october of 2018  in order to finance the acxiom acquisition as well as increased shortterm borrowings and higher interest rates throughout the year this was partially offset by decreased noncash interest expense from revaluations of mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests for 2017  net interest expense increased by 09  as compared to 2016  

other expense net

income taxes 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

effective tax rate 

our tax rates are affected by many factors including our worldwide earnings from various countries changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income in 2018  our effective income tax rate of 238  was positively impacted by us tax incentives foreign tax credits from a distribution of unremitted earnings the net reversal of valuation allowance in continental europe and research and development credits the effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances nondeductible losses on sales of businesses and assets held for sale by tax expense associated with the change to our assertion regarding the permanent reinvestment of undistributed earnings attributable to certain foreign subsidiaries and by tax expense related to the trueup of our december 31 2017 tax reform estimates as permitted by sec staff issued accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” 

public law 11597 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was signed into law on december 22 2017 the tax act legislated many new tax provisions which have impacted our operations at december 31 2017 provisional amounts were recorded as permitted by sab 118 we have finalized our calculations of the impact of the tax act and have revised our estimates as required by sab 118 this resulted in a net tax expense of 134 primarily attributable to our estimate of the tax imposed on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings 

the company has historically asserted that its unremitted foreign earnings are permanently reinvested and therefore has not recorded income taxes on such amounts in light of our increased debt and associated servicing commitments in connection with the acxiom acquisition that was consummated on october 1 2018 the company reevaluated its global cash needs and as a result determined that approximately 4350  of undistributed foreign earnings from certain international entities are no longer subject to the permanent reinvestment assertion we recorded a tax expense of 108  representing our estimate of the tax costs associated with this change to our assertion we have not changed our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to any other international entities as we intend to use the related historical earnings and profits to fund international operations and investments 

the tax act imposed a new tax on certain foreign earnings generated in 2018 and forward these global intangible lowtaxed income gilti tax rules are complex us gaap allows us to choose an accounting policy which treats the us tax under gilti provisions as either a current expense as incurred or as a component of the company’s measurement of deferred taxes the company has elected to account for the gilti tax as a current expense 

in 2017  our effective income tax rate of 323  was positively impacted by a net benefit of 360 as a result of the tax act as well as excess tax benefits on employee sharebased payments partially offset by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances 

in 2016  our effective income tax rate of 238  was positively impacted by a benefit of 446  related to refunds to be claimed on future amended us federal returns for tax years 2014 and 2015 primarily related to foreign tax credits and to a lesser extent research and development credits based on the conclusion of multiyear studies the settlement of 2011 and 2012 income tax audits which included the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits of 234  the reversal of valuation allowances of 122  as a consequence of the disposition of certain businesses in continental europe excess tax benefits on employee sharebased payments and various changes in state income tax laws as well as the recognition of previously unrecognized state tax benefits as a result of a lapse in statute of limitations the positive impacts to our tax rates were partially offset by the revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of a statutory tax rate change in continental europe losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances and by losses on sales of businesses for which we did not receive a full tax benefit

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow overview 

the following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity capital resources and uses of capital 





   

operating activities 

due to the seasonality of our business we typically use cash from working capital in the first nine months of a year with the largest impact in the first quarter and generate cash from working capital in the fourth quarter driven by the seasonally strong media spending by our clients quarterly and annual working capital results are impacted by the fluctuating annual media spending budgets of our clients as well as their changing media spending patterns throughout each year across various countries 

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients across various countries affects our working capital and operating cash flow and can be volatile in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients the amounts involved which substantially exceed our revenues primarily affect the level of accounts receivable accounts payable accrued liabilities and contract liabilities our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments for example while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2018  was 5651  which was a decrease of 3167  as compared to 2017  primarily as a result of an increase in working capital usage of 4364  working capital in 2018 was impacted by the spending levels of our clients as compared to 2017 the working capital usage in both periods was primarily attributable to our media businesses 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2017  was 8818  which was an increase of 3690  as compared to 2016  primarily as a result of an improvement in working capital usage of 4156  working capital in 2017 benefited from the spending patterns of our clients compared to 2016 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during 2018  consisted of payments for acquisitions of 23098  related mostly to the acxiom acquisition and payments for capital expenditures of 1771  related mostly to leasehold improvements and computer hardware and software 

net cash used in investing activities during 2017  primarily consisted of payments for capital expenditures of 1559  related mostly to leasehold improvements and computer hardware and software 

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities during 2018  was driven by net proceeds from longterm debt of 24942  primarily to finance the acxiom acquisition partially offset by the payment of dividends of 3221  the repurchase of 51  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 1171  including fees and the repayment of longterm debt of 1048  

net cash used in financing activities during 2017  was primarily driven by the redemption of all 3000 in aggregate principal amount of the 225 senior notes due 2017 the repurchase of 137  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 3001  including fees and the payment of dividends of 2803  

foreign exchange rate changes 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in an a net decrease of 473  in 2018  the decrease was primarily a result of the us dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies including the australian dollar south african rand and indian rupee as of december 31 2018  compared to december 31 2017  

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in an increase of 168  in 2017  primarily a result of the australian dollar strengthening against the us dollar as of december 31 2017  compared to december 31 2016  

liquidity outlook 

we expect our cash flow from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months we also have a committed corporate credit facility as well as uncommitted lines of credit and a commercial paper program available to support our operating needs we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity with flexibility over significant uses of cash including our capital expenditures cash used for new acquisitions our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends 

from time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional funds or otherwise improve our liquidity profile enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors which include those specific to us such as our credit ratings and those related to the financial markets such as the amount or terms of available credit there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity or continue to access existing sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

funding requirements 

our most significant funding requirements include our operations noncancelable operating lease obligations capital expenditures acquisitions common stock dividends taxes and debt service additionally we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests 

notable funding requirements include

 acxiom acquisition 

on october 1 2018 pursuant to the terms of the membership interest purchase agreement dated as of july 2 2018 we completed the acxiom acquisition for 23279  subject to customary closing adjustments the combined proceeds from the senior notes and the term loan agreement were used to fund the transaction see note 6 in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data for further information

on july 2 2018 in connection with the announcement of the acxiom acquisition we announced that share repurchases will be suspended for a period of time in order to reduce the increased debt levels incurred in conjunction with the acquisition as of december 31 2018  3384  excluding fees remains available for repurchase under the share repurchase programs there is no expiration date associated with the share repurchase programs

financing and sources of funds 

substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries 

at december 31 2018  we held 2643  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in foreign subsidiaries the company has historically asserted that its unremitted foreign earnings are permanently reinvested and therefore has not recorded any income taxes on such amounts in light of our increased debt and associated servicing commitments in connection with the acxiom acquisition that was consummated on october 1 2018 the company reevaluated its global cash needs and as a result determined that approximately 4350  of undistributed foreign earnings from certain international entities are no longer subject to the permanent reinvestment assertion we have not changed our permanent reinvestment assertion with respect to any other international entities as we intend to use the related historical earnings and profits to fund international operations and investments 

credit agreements 

we maintain a committed corporate credit facility originally dated as of july 18 2008 which has been amended and restated from time to time the credit agreement we use our credit agreement to increase our financial flexibility to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries and to support our commercial paper program the credit agreement is a revolving facility expiring in october 2022 under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 15000  or the equivalent in other currencies the company has the ability to increase the commitments under the credit agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to 2500  provided the company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of 500  or the equivalent in other currencies our obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured as of december 31 2018  there were no  borrowings under the credit agreement however we had 85  of letters of credit under the credit agreement which reduced our total availability to 14915  

on july 27 2018 we entered into amendment no 1 to our credit agreement the amendment the amendment increased the maximum leverage ratio covenant to i 400 to 100  for the first second and third fiscal quarters ending after the acxiom closing date ii 375 to 100  for the fourth fifth sixth and seventh full fiscal quarters ending after the acxiom closing date and iii 350 to 100  for the eighth full fiscal quarter ending after the acxiom closing date and thereafter 

under the credit agreement we can elect to receive advances bearing interest based on either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate each as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin that is determined based on our credit ratings as of december 31 2018  the applicable margin was 010  for base rate advances and 110  for eurocurrency rate advances letter of credit fees accrue on the average daily aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at a rate equal to the applicable margin for eurocurrency rate advances and fronting fees accrue on the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at an annual rate of 025  we also pay a facility fee at an annual rate that is determined based on our credit ratings which as of december 31 2018  was 015  on the aggregate lending commitment under the credit agreement 

the table below sets forth the financial covenants in effect as of december 31 2018  which apply to both the credit agreement and the term loan agreement 





 

as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with all of our covenants in the credit agreement and the term loan agreement if we were unable to comply with our covenants in the future we would seek an amendment or waiver from the applicable lenders but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver if we were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver these facilities could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any

outstanding principal in addition under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit agreement 

we also have uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates and that are primarily used to fund working capital needs we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some of our operations as of december 31 2018  the company had uncommitted lines of credit in an aggregate amount of 11731  under which we had outstanding borrowings of 737 classified as shortterm borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet the average amount outstanding during 2018  was 964  with a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 45  

commercial paper 

the company is authorized to issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 15000  borrowings under the commercial paper program are supported by the credit agreement described above proceeds of the commercial paper are used for working capital and general corporate purposes including the repayment of maturing indebtedness and other shortterm liquidity needs the maturities of the commercial paper vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue as of december 31 2018  there was no commercial paper outstanding the average amount outstanding under the program was 6487  in 2018  with a weightedaverage interest rate of 24 and a weightedaverage maturity of twentytwo days 

cash pooling 

we aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the united states we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several ipg agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all agencies does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of bank overdrafts under all of our pooling arrangements and as of december 31 2018  and 2017  the amounts netted were 20658  and 14120  respectively 

debt credit ratings 

our debt credit ratings as of february 13 2019 are listed below 



a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity either adverse or favorable because among other things they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise for example our credit agreement and term loan agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid and our access to the commercial paper market is contingent on our maintenance of sufficient shortterm debt ratings 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our consolidated financial statements management has discussed with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising and communications and marketing services including public relations meeting and event production sports and entertainment marketing corporate and brand identity and strategic marketing consulting around the world 

most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the basis on which we earn fees and commissions vary significantly our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 30 to 90 days our payment terms vary by client and the time between invoicing date and due date is typically not significant we generally have the legally enforceable right to payment for all services provided through the end of the contract or termination date 

effective january 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards codification topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 using the full retrospective transition method under this method we revised our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2017 and applicable interim periods within the year ended december 31 2017 as if asc 606 had been effective for those periods asc 606 applies to all contracts with customers except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards we recognize revenue when we determine our customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services to determine revenue recognition we perform the following five steps i identify the contracts with a customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue as or when we satisfy the performance obligation we only apply the fivestep model to contracts when it is probable that ipg will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer at contract inception we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are distinct performance obligations we then assess whether we act as an agent or a principal for each identified performance obligation and include revenue within the transaction price for thirdparty costs when we determine that we act as principal 

net revenue primarily consisting of fees commissions and performance incentives represents the amount of our gross billings excluding billable expenses charged to a client generally our compensation is based on a negotiated fixed price rate per hour a retainer or commission the majority of our fees are recognized over time as services are performed utilizing a function of hours incurred and rates per hour as compared to periodically updated estimates to complete for certain lessfrequent commissionbased contracts which contain clauses allowing our clients to terminate the arrangement at any time for no compensation revenue is recognized at a point in time typically the date of broadcast or publication 

 contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to mutually agreedupon qualitative andor quantitative metrics performance incentives are treated as variable consideration which is estimated at contract inception and included in revenue based on the most likely amount earned out of a range of potential outcomes our estimates are based on a combination of historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment these estimates are updated on a periodic basis and are not expected to result in a reversal of a significant amount of the cumulative revenue recognized 

the predominant component of billable expenses are thirdparty vendor costs incurred for performance obligations where we have determined that we are acting as principal these thirdparty expenses are generally billed back to our clients billable expenses also includes incidental costs incurred in the performance of our services including airfare mileage hotel stays outoftown meals and telecommunication charges we record these billable expenses within total revenue with a corresponding offset to operating expenses 

in international markets we may receive rebates or credits from vendors based on transactions entered into on behalf of clients rebates and credits are remitted back to our clients in accordance with our contractual requirements or may be retained by us based on the terms of a particular client contract and local law amounts owed back to clients are recorded as a liability and amounts retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned 

in certain international markets our media contracts may allow clients to terminate our arrangement at any time for no compensation to the extent that media has not yet run for those contracts we do not recognize revenue until the media runs which is the point in time at which we have a legally enforceable right to compensation 

performance obligations 

our client contracts may include various goods and services that are capable of being distinct are distinct within the context of the contract and are therefore accounted for as separate performance obligations we allocate revenue to each performance obligation in the contract at inception based on its relative standalone selling price 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

our advertising businesses include a wide range of services that involve the creation of an advertising idea concept campaign or marketing strategy in order to promote the client’s brand creative services and to act as an agent to facilitate the production of advertisements by thirdparty suppliers production services” our clients can contract us to perform one or both of these services as they can derive standalone benefit from each production services can include formatting creative material for different media and communication mediums including digital largescale reproduction such as printing and adaptation services talent engagement and acquisition television and radio production and outdoor billboard production our contracts that include both services are typically explicit in the description of which activities constitute the creative advertising services and those that constitute the production services both the creative and production services are sold separately the client can derive utility from each service on its own we do not provide a significant service of integrating these activities into a bundle the services do not significantly modify one another and the services are not highly interrelated or interdependent as such we typically identify two performance obligations in the assessment of our advertising contracts 

our media businesses include services to formulate strategic media plans media planning services and to act as an agent to purchase media eg television and radio spots outdoor advertising digital banners etc from vendors on their behalf media buying services our contracts that include both services are typically explicit in the description of which activities constitute the planning services and those that constitute the buying services both the planning and buying services are sold separately the client can derive utility from each service on its own we do not provide a significant service of integrating these activities into a bundle the services do not significantly modify one another and the services are not highly interrelated or interdependent as such we typically identify two performance obligations in the assessment of our media contracts 

our events businesses include creative services related to the conception and planning of custom marketing events as well as activation services which entail the carrying out of the event including but not limited to setup design and staffing additionally our public relations businesses include a broad range of services such as strategic planning social media strategy and the monitoring and development of communication strategies among others while our contracts in these businesses may include some or all of these services we typically identify only one performance obligation in the assessment of our events and public relations contracts as we provide a significant service of integrating the individual services into a combined service for which the customer has contracted 

principal vs agent 

when a thirdparty is involved in the delivery of our services to the client we assess whether or not we are acting as a principal or an agent in the arrangement the assessment is based on whether we control the specified services at any time before they are transferred to the customer we have determined that in our events and public relations businesses we generally act as a principal as our agencies provide a significant service of integrating goods or services provided by third parties into the specified deliverable to our clients in addition we have determined that we are responsible for the performance of the thirdparty suppliers which are combined with our own services before transferring those services to the customer in addition we have determined that we act as principal when providing creative services and media planning services as we perform a significant integration service in these transactions for performance obligations in which we act as principal we record the gross amount billed to the customer within total revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as billable expenses 

when a thirdparty is involved in the production of an advertising campaign and for media buying services we have determined that we act as the agent and are solely arranging for the thirdparty suppliers to provide services to the customer specifically we do not control the specified services before transferring those services to the customer we are not primarily responsible for the performance of the thirdparty services nor can we redirect those services to fulfill any other contracts we do not have inventory risk or discretion in establishing pricing in our contracts with customers for performance obligations for which we act as the agent we record our revenue as the net amount of our gross billings less amounts remitted to third parties 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes us federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 

we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets which is primarily dependent on future earnings a valuation allowance shall be recognized when based on available evidence it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the factors used in assessing valuation allowances include all available evidence such as past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in circumstances where there is negative evidence establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance conversely a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance further in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings 

the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally guidance is provided for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments we evaluate our tax positions using the “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of october 1 st  each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we have 13  reporting units that were subject to the 2018  annual impairment testing our annual impairment review as of october 1 2018  did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units 

in performing our annual impairment review we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings financial performance and other relevant entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or clients as well as pending litigation if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the entity is required to determine the fair value and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value otherwise no additional testing is required 

for reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value a quantitative impairment test is performed for our annual impairment test we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units equity to the carrying value of their net assets the sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the quantitative impairment test is failed and impaired goodwill is written down to its fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

for our 2018  and 2017  annual impairment tests we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for ten and eight reporting units and performed the quantitative impairment test for three and three reporting units respectively for the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances including financial performance macroeconomic conditions and entityspecific factors such as client wins and losses based on this assessment we have concluded that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value therefore no additional testing was required 

the 2018  and 2017  fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data we generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our analysis for the income approach we used projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions factors 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth profit margins terminal value growth rates capital expenditures projections assumed tax rates discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management for the market approach we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparablecompany market multiples 

these estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit the discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit for the 2018  test the discount rate we used for our reporting units tested ranged between 110  and 120  and the terminal value growth rate was 30  the terminal value growth rate represents the expected longterm growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides and the global economy for the 2018  test the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 30  and 50  factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit we believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period actual results of operations cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation and it is possible that differences and changes could be material a deterioration in profitability adverse market conditions significant client losses changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future 

we also perform a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit where the low end of the range increases discount rates by 05 and the high end of the range decreases discount rates by 05 we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the quantitative impairment test 

the table below displays the midpoint of the fair value range for each reporting unit tested in the 2018  and 2017  annual impairment tests indicating that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units by greater than 20 



based on the analysis described above for the reporting units for which we performed the quantitative impairment test we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of october 1 2018  because these reporting units passed the test as the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values 

we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups these asset groups are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7  and 15  years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations we determine our discount rates for our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and significant foreign pension plans based on either a bond selectionsettlement approach or bond yield curve approach using the bond selectionsettlement approach we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments using the bond yield curve approach we determine the discount rate by matching the plans cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve both approaches utilize highquality aarated corporate bonds and the plans projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments which is then used to develop a single discount rate in countries where markets for 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

highquality longterm aa corporate bonds are not well developed a portfolio of longterm government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate 

the discount rate used to calculate net pension and postretirement benefit costs is determined at the beginning of each year for the year ended december 31 2018  discount rates of 370  for the domestic pension plan and 365  for the domestic postretirement benefit plan and a weightedaverage discount rate of 236  for the significant foreign pension plans were used to calculate 2018  net pension and postretirement benefit costs a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2018  net pension and postretirement benefit cost by 01  and 02  respectively 

the discount rate used to measure our benefit obligations is determined at the end of each year as of december 31 2018  we used discount rates of 435  for the domestic pension plan and 430  for the domestic postretirement benefit plan and a weightedaverage discount rate of 261  for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the december 31 2018  benefit obligation by approximately 220  and 230  respectively 

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions current and expected market conditions risk premiums associated with asset classes and longterm inflation rates we determine both a shortterm and longterm view and then select a longterm rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities 

for 2018  the weightedaverage expected rates of return of 700  and 470  were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively for 2019  we plan to use expected rates of return of 700  and 476  for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held a lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2018  net pension cost by approximately 10  

recent accounting standards 

see note 16  in item 8  financial statements and supplementary data  for further information on certain accounting standards that have been adopted during 2018  or that have not yet been required to be implemented and may be applicable to our future operations 

nongaap financial measure 

this mda includes both financial measures in accordance with us gaap as well as a nongaap financial measure the nongaap financial measure represents net income available to ipg common stockholder before provision for incomes taxes total expenses and other income equity in net loss income of unconsolidated affiliates net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and amortization of acquired intangibles which we refer to as “ebita” 

 ebita should be viewed as supplemental to and not as an alternative for net income available to ipg common stockholders calculated in accordance with us gaap net income or operating income calculated in accordance with us gaap operating income this section also includes reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure to the most directly comparable us gaap financial measures as presented below 

ebita is used by our management as an additional measure of our company’s performance for purposes of business decisionmaking including developing budgets managing expenditures and evaluating potential acquisitions or divestitures periodtoperiod comparisons of ebita help our management identify additional trends in our company’s financial results that may not be shown solely by periodtoperiod comparisons of net income or operating income in addition we may use ebita in the incentive compensation programs applicable to some of our employees in order to evaluate our company’s performance our management recognizes that ebita has inherent limitations because of the excluded items particularly those items that are recurring in nature management also reviews operation and net income as well as the specific items that are excluded from ebita but included in net income or operating income as well as trends in those items the amounts of those items are set forth for the applicable periods in the reconciliation of ebita to net income that accompany our disclosure documents containing nongaap financial measures including the reconciliations contained in this mda 

we believe that the presentation of ebita is useful to investors in their analysis of our results for reasons similar to the reasons why our management finds it useful and because it helps facilitate investor understanding of decisions made by management in light of the performance metrics used in making those decisions in addition as more fully described below we believe that providing ebita together with a reconciliation of this nongaap financial measure to net income helps investors

make comparisons between our company and other companies that may have different capital structures different effective income tax rates and tax attributes different capitalized asset values andor different forms of employee compensation however ebita is intended to provide a supplemental way of comparing our company with other public companies and is not intended as a substitute for comparisons based on net income or operating income in making any comparisons to other companies investors need to be aware that companies may use different nongaap measures to evaluate their financial performance investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measures and the corresponding us gaap measures provided by each company under the applicable rules of the us securities and exchange commission 

the following is an explanation of the items excluded by us from ebita but included in net income

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

amounts in millions 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items from time to time we use derivative instruments pursuant to established guidelines and policies to manage some portion of these risks derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rates 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations the majority of our debt approximately 86  and 94  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively bears interest at fixed rates we do have debt with variable interest rates but a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a 10 change in interest rates is summarized below 



we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates we did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2018  

we had 6735  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2018  that we generally invest in conservative shortterm bank deposits or securities the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements during 2018  and 2017  we had interest income of 218  and 194  respectively based on our 2018  results a 100 basispoint increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately 67  assuming that all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from yearend 2018  levels 

foreign currency rates 

we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations the foreign currencies that most favorably impacted our results during the year ended december 31   2018  were the euro and british pound sterling the foreign currencies that most adversely impacted our results during the year ended december 31  of 2018  were the argentine peso and brazilian real based on 2018  exchange rates and operating results if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10 we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4  assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2018  levels 

the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency mitigating transaction risk however certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes 

we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency the us dollar and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary 

credit and market risks 

balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities accounts receivable and accounts receivable billable to clients we invest our cash primarily in investmentgrade shortterm securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 

our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods

principal markets 

our agencies are located in over 100  countries including every significant world market our geographic revenue breakdown is listed below 



for further information on a geographical basis regarding revenues for each of the last three years and longlived assets for each of the last two years see note 12  to the consolidated financial statements 

sources of revenue 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world our revenues are directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients and our ability to win new clients most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 90 days 

revenues for the creation planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate the difference is the commission that we earn which we either retain in full or share with the client depending on the nature of the applicable services agreement 

we also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion event marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients as is customary in the advertising and marketing industries to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients and in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor 

our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work that is typically completed during the fourth quarter fee revenue recognized on a completedcontract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at december 31 



see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition accounting policies 

clients 

our large and diverse client base includes many of the most recognizable companies and brands throughout the world our holding company structure allows us to maintain a diversified client base across and within a full range of industry sectors in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 20  of revenue in both 2017  and 2016  our largest client accounted for approximately 4  of revenue for both 2017  and 2016  based on revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  our largest client sectors in alphabetical order were auto and transportation healthcare and technology and telecom we represent several different clients brands or divisions within each of these sectors in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency brands representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time 

we operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry our operating companies compete against other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies and new forms of market participants to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships 

regulatory environment 

the advertising and marketing services that our agencies provide are subject to governmental regulation and other action in all of the jurisdictions in which the company operates while these governmental regulations and other actions can impact the company’s operations the specific marketing regulations we may face in a given market do not as a general matter significantly impact the company’s overall service offerings or the nature in which we provide these services 

governments government agencies and industry selfregulatory bodies have adopted laws regulations and standards and judicial bodies have issued rulings that directly or indirectly affect the form and content of advertising public relations and other marketing activities we produce or conduct on behalf of our clients these laws regulations and other actions include contentrelated rules with respect to specific products and services restrictions on media scheduling and placement and labeling or warning requirements with respect to certain products for example pharmaceuticals alcoholic beverages cigarettes and other tobacco products and food and nutritional supplements we are also subject to rules related to marketing directed to certain groups such as children 

digital marketing services are a dynamic and growing sector of our business our service offerings in this area are covered by laws and regulations concerning user privacy use of personal information data protection and online tracking technologies existing and proposed laws and regulations in this area such as the general data protection regulation gdpr coming into effect in the european union can impact the development efficacy and profitability of internetbased and other digital marketing limitations on the scheduling content or delivery of direct marketing activities can likewise impact the activities of our agencies offering those services 

with agencies and clients located in over 100 countries worldwide we are also subject to laws governing our international operations these include broad anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and the uk bribery act 2010 which generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to government officials and political figures export controls and economic sanctions regimes such as those maintained by the us government and comparable ones by the member states of the european union impose limitations on the company’s ability to operate in certain geographic regions or to 

seek or service certain potential clients likewise our treasury operations must comply with exchange controls restrictions on currency repatriation and the control requirements of applicable antimoneylaundering statutes 

personnel 

as of december 31 2017  we employed approximately 50200  people of whom approximately 20100  were employed in the united states because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success we conduct extensive employee training and development throughout our agencies and benchmark our compensation programs against those of our industry for their competitiveness and effectiveness in recruitment and retention there is keen competition for qualified employees

risk factors 

tableend

we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition see also statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and other providers of creative marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants competitive challenges also arise from rapidlyevolving and new technologies in the marketing and advertising space creating opportunities for new and existing competitors and a need for continued significant investment in tools technologies and process improvements 

the client’s perception of the quality of our agencies’ creative work and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services may also be an important competitive consideration on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people freedom of entry into the industry is almost unlimited and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

 many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time and we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions our clients may choose to terminate their contracts or reduce their relationships with us on a relatively short time frame and for any reason a relatively small number of clients contribute a significant portion of our revenue in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 20  of revenue in 2017  a substantial decline in a large client’s advertising and marketing spending or the loss of a significant part of its business could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 

our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest or our own exclusivity arrangements with certain clients these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

 we are exposed to risks associated with weak regional or global economic conditions and increased disruption in the financial markets the global economy continues to be challenging in some parts of the world uncertainty about the strength of the global economy generally or economic conditions in certain regions and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general in the past some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses this pattern may recur in the future furthermore unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations 

 our employees including creative digital research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most valuable assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and other factors which may be beyond our control changes to us or other immigration policies that restrain the flow of professional talent may inhibit our ability to staff our offices or projects in addition the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and writeoffs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients and if these effects were severe the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity 

furthermore in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities to the extent possible we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients however if clients are unable to pay for commitments that we have entered into on their behalf or if clients seek to significantly delay or otherwise alter payment terms there could be an adverse effect on our working capital which would negatively impact our operating cash flow 

 we are a global business with agencies located in over 100  countries including every significant world market operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues approximately 40  in 2017  these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation currency variation exchange control restrictions local labor and employment laws that hinder workforce flexibility and difficult social political or economic conditions we also must comply with applicable us local and other international anticorruption laws including the fcpa and the uk antibribery act 2010 which can be comprehensive complex and stringent in all jurisdictions where we operate export controls and economic sanctions such as those maintained by the office of foreign assets control of the us department of the treasury can impose limitations on our ability to operate in certain geographic regions or to seek or service certain potential clients these restrictions can place us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to those competitors who may not be subject to comparable restrictions failure to comply or to implement business practices that sufficiently prevent corruption or violation of sanctions laws could result in significant remediation expense and expose us to significant civil and criminal penalties and reputational harm 

given our substantial operations in the united kingdom and continental europe we face uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of the uk’s june 2016 referendum in which voters approved the united kingdom’s exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” it is possible that brexit and changes resulting from brexit will cause increased regulatory and legal complexities and create uncertainty surrounding our business including our relationships with existing and future clients suppliers and employees and the potential impact of increased restrictions on the free movement of labor capital goods and services between the united kingdom and the remaining members of the european union which could have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations 

in developing countries or regions we may face further risks such as slower receipt of payments nationalization social and economic instability currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries 

in addition because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan renminbi euro and indian rupee fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies including the persistent strength of the us dollar in recent periods may adversely affect our financial results in particular brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and the british pound sterling 

 our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation regulation judicial actions or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare our business is also subject to specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products existing and proposed laws and regulations in particular in the european union and the united states concerning user privacy use of personal information and online tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internetbased and digital marketing the costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of the implementation of new laws or regulations such as the gdpr or changes in interpretations of current ones any failure on our part to comply with these legal requirements or their application in an unanticipated manner could harm our business and result in penalties or significant legal liability legislators agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products such as alcohol or tobacco and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may 

hinder our ability to accomplish our clients’ goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently on our revenues governmental action including judicial rulings on the relative responsibilities of clients and their marketing agencies for the content of their marketing can also impact our operations furthermore we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial 

 we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity our forecasts of the investment’s future performance also factor into the initial consideration when actual financial results differ our returns on the investment could be adversely affected 

we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees businesses assets or systems into our organization including with respect to our internal policies and required controls we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investments operations furthermore it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all talent is among our most valuable assets and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel acquisition and integration activity may also divert management’s attention and other corporate resources from other business needs if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

 we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information developing new business opportunities and digital products and processing business transactions the incidence of malicious technologyrelated events such as cyberattacks computer hacking computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide power outages equipment failure natural disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis with a large number of agencies and legal entities and the resulting size diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase our potential vulnerability to such breakdowns malicious intrusions or attacks 

likewise data privacy breaches as well as improper use of social media by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data such as personally identifiable information strategic plans and trade secrets could be exposed to third parties or to the general public we operate worldwide and the legal rules governing data transfers are often complex conflicting unclear or everchanging we also utilize third parties including thirdparty “cloud” computing services to store transfer or process data and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business 

any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability be expensive to remedy result in a loss of our or our clients’ or vendors’ proprietary information and damage our reputation efforts to develop implement and maintain security measures are costly may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated 

 we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and fixed assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance 

as of december 31 2017  we have substantial amounts of longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet including approximately 38 billion  of goodwill future events including our financial performance market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies loss of a significant client’s business or strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our 

reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets as well as our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 from time to time we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them see statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 we maintain a 15 billion committed corporate credit facility the “credit agreement” to increase our financial flexibility we also maintain a commercial paper program under which we are authorized to issue shortterm debt up to an aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 15 billion which we use for working capital and general corporate purposes borrowings under the commercial paper program are supported by the credit agreement if credit under the credit agreement or our ability to access the commercial paper market were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity could be adversely affected the credit agreement contains financial covenants and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them for example compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders and our costs under the credit agreement could increase if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver the credit agreement could be terminated and any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration 

furthermore if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook see “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness including covenants and interest rates we could be adversely affected if our credit ratings were downgraded or if they were significantly weaker than those of our competitors our access to the commercial paper market is contingent on our maintenance of sufficient shortterm debt ratings and any downgrades to those ratings could reduce the market capacity for or our ability to issue commercial paper our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

 although as a nonmanufacturing service business we generally are not directly impacted by current laws and regulations with respect to climate change and other sustainability concerns we could incur related costs indirectly through our clients increasingly our clients request that we comply with their own social responsibility sustainability or other business policies or standards which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations before they commence or continue doing business with us our compliance with these policies and related certification requirements could be costly and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business relationships or reputation further if clients’ costs are adversely affected by climate change or related laws and regulations this could negatively impact their spending on our advertising and marketing services we could also face increased prices from our own suppliers that face climate changerelated costs and that seek to pass on their increased costs to their customers

executive summary 

our organic revenue increase in 2017  was driven by growth throughout most of our geographic regions which was primarily a result of growth with existing clients the growth in our domestic market was primarily driven by our media and advertising disciplines our international organic increase was primarily driven by strong growth within our media discipline with notable contributions from continental europe and our other region primarily in canada the asia pacific region weighed on our international growth mainly due to a challenging and competitive market within our advertising discipline we continued to have increased growth in demand for our full range of services including media creative and marketing services across most of our regional markets we carefully managed our operating expenses which reflected investments made in our agencies to support our new business portfolio service our existing clients and grow our capabilities 

overall demand for our services by clients remains solid though our growth slowed in 2017 relative to its strong pace in recent years due to challenging comparable performance over the last three years and to caution on the part of some large marketers that characterized our industry in 2017 we continue to derive substantial benefit from our diversified client base our global footprint and the broad range and strength of our professional offerings we continued to enhance our businesses during 2017  by making investments in creative and strategic talent that emphasize our growth priorities fastgrowth digital marketing channels highgrowth geographic regions creative talent and strategic world markets we believe our continued investment in tools technology and process improvements will create efficiencies in the delivery of our services 

we continued to enhance value to our shareholders through common stock dividends share repurchases and improvements in our balance sheet basic earnings per share available to ipg common stockholders for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  were 149  153  and 111  per share respectively diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  were 146  149  and 109  per share respectively basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2017 included a net positive impact of 009  per share as a result of the tax cuts and jobs act as discussed in further detail in the income taxes   section of our mda basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2017 included a negative impact of 004  per share from net losses on sales of businesses due to completed dispositions and the classification of certain assets as held for sale basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2016 included a net positive impact of 020 per share from various tax items as discussed in further detail in the income taxes  section of our mda basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 included negative impacts of 010 and 012 per share respectively from net losses on sales of businesses due to completed dispositions and the classification of certain assets as held for sale

the following tables present a summary of financial performance for the year ended december 31 2017  as compared with the same periods in 2016  and 2015  



when we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the remainder we call organic change which indicates how our underlying business performed the performance metrics that we use to evaluate our results include the organic change in revenue salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses and the components of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue additionally in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by geographic region and also by business sector in which we focus on our top 100 clients which typically constitute approximately 55 to 60 of our annual consolidated revenues 

the change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the priorperiod reported results using the currentperiod exchange rates and comparing these priorperiod adjusted amounts to the priorperiod reported results although the us dollar is our reporting currency a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies therefore our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar affect our consolidated results of operations and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact on us related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region the foreign currency that most adversely impacted our results during 2017  was the british pound sterling partially offset by the brazilian real and south african rand 

for purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred during the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions

consolidated results of operations 

revenue 

our revenue is directly impacted by the retention and spending levels of existing clients and by our ability to win new clients most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter in the events marketing business revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete when we act as principal for these projects we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs are incurred as passthrough costs in office and general expenses 



during 2017  our revenue increased by 358  or 05  compared to 2016  comprised of an organic revenue increase of 1389  or 18  partially offset by the effect of net divestitures of 1003  and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 28  our organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to growth within the healthcare auto government and industrials sectors partially offset by decreases in the technology and telecom and the consumer packaged goods sectors the organic increase in our domestic market was mainly driven by strong growth at our media and advertising businesses partially offset by weakness in our public relations and digital specialist agencies in our international markets the organic revenue increase was primarily driven by growth at our media businesses and public relations agencies across all regions and our advertising businesses in the united kingdom partially offset by decreases at our advertising businesses in the asia pacific and latin america regions and our events business in the united kingdom primarily as a result of certain projects where we no longer act as principal 



during 2016  our revenue increased by 2328  or 31  compared to 2015  comprised of an organic revenue increase of 3772  or 50  and the effect of net acquisitions of 153  partially offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 1597  our organic revenue increase was throughout all geographic regions attributable to a combination of higher spending from existing clients and net client wins in most client sectors notably in the healthcare and technology and telecom sectors the organic increase in our domestic market was driven by growth across nearly all disciplines most notably at our digital specialist agencies and advertising businesses in our international markets the organic revenue increase was driven by growth across all disciplines most notably at our media businesses in all geographic regions primarily in continental europe led by germany as well as our events business where we had an increase in the united kingdom offset by a decrease in the asia pacific region also contributing to our international organic revenue increase were our digital specialist agencies primarily in the latin america

operating expenses 



in 2017  our operating margin expanded to 124  from 120  in 2016  mainly driven by an increase in revenue of 05  partially offset by a slight increase in total operating expenses in 2016  our change in revenue of 31  from 2015  outpaced an increase in total operating expenses of 25  resulting in operating margin expansion to 120  from 115  our operating income grew 35  in 2017  to 9736  and 76  in 2016  to 9410  

salaries and related expenses 

salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs employee performance incentives including annual bonus and longterm incentive awards costs for temporary workers severance and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with shortterm changes in revenue levels however salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of the hiring of personnel including freelancers to support revenue growth and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards additionally we may take severance actions in areas where we have or anticipate decreases in operating performance or to enhance our teams or leadership changes in our incentive awards mix can impact futureperiod expense as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year in which they are earned and longterm incentive awards are expensed over the performance period generally three years factors impacting longterm incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting assumptions regarding forfeiture rates the change in our stock price actual results and changes to our projected results which could impact the achievement of certain performance targets 



 salaries and related expenses in 2017  increased by 330  compared to 2016  due to an organic increase of 1023  partially offset by the effect of net divestitures of 652  and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 41  the organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in base salaries benefits and tax partially offset by lower incentive expense and a decrease in acquisitionrelated contractual compensation which is classified within all other salaries and related expenses in the table below our staff cost ratio defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue slightly increased in 2017  to 643  from 642  when compared to the prior year 

 salaries and related expenses in 2016  increased by 1803  compared to 2015  due to an organic increase of 2778  and the effect of net acquisitions of 22  partially offset by a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 997  the organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in base salaries benefits and tax as a result of increases in our workforce at businesses and in regions where we had revenue growth or new business wins over the last twelve months and higher longterm incentive awards expense as a result of improved financial performance our staff cost ratio increased in 2016  to 642  from 638  in 2015

office and general expenses in 2017  decreased by 298  compared to 2016  comprised of an organic increase of 94  the effect of net divestitures of 367  and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 25  the organic increase was primarily attributable to higher occupancy costs partially offset by decreases in adjustments to contingent acquisition obligations as compared to the prior year and lower production expenses related to passthrough costs our office and general expense ratio defined as office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue decreased in 2017  to 234  from 238  in 2016

income taxes 



the 2017 us tax cuts and jobs act 

our tax rates are affected by many factors including our worldwide earnings from various countries changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income public law 11597 commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 the tax act legislated many new tax provisions which have impacted our operations including the reduction of the us federal income tax rate from 350  to 210  effective in 2018 a current tax on the deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and a us tax exemption for future distributions of certain foreign earnings 

us gaap requires the income tax accounting effect of a change in tax law including the effects on current and deferred income taxes to be reflected in the period in which such law is enacted the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 on december 22 2017 which acknowledges that the information necessary to determine such income tax effects may not be sufficiently available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting under us gaap sab 118 allows 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

for the reporting of provisional amounts for those specific tax effects for which a reasonable estimate can be made and for no amounts to be recorded where a reasonable estimate cannot be made any subsequent adjustments to reported amounts will be made over the measurement period which begins in the reporting period that includes the tax acts enactment date and ends when an entity has obtained prepared and analyzed the information that is needed in order to complete the accounting requirements under us gaap not to exceed one year from the enactment date 

we have reasonably estimated the tax effect of remeasuring our deferred tax balances and reserves at year end to reflect the tax effect of the reversal of such deferred tax balances in future periods during which the us federal income tax rate will be 210  we have recorded a decrease related to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities with a corresponding provisional net benefit to our deferred income taxes of 1047  the tax act’s various changes to the treatment of fixed assets and deferred compensation are sufficiently complex to conclude that an adjustment may be necessary 

the tax act also imposes a tax on certain unremitted foreign earnings at various tax rates we have reasonably estimated the tax effect of this deemed repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and have recorded tax expense of 623  as a provisional amount due to the fact that necessary information could not be attained prepared or analyzed on a timely basis to be able to complete the calculations the complexity of the rules and the comprehensive data requirements will likely result in some adjustment to the provisional amount the company expects to pay this amount over the next eight years as further detailed in the liquidity and capital resources  section of our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

additionally the tax act imposes a new tax on certain foreign earnings generated in 2018 and forward we are continuing to evaluate these global intangible lowtaxed income gilti tax rules which are extremely complex us gaap allows us to choose between an accounting policy which treats the us tax under gilti provisions as either a current expense as incurred or as a component of the company’s measurement of deferred taxes we are not able to reasonably estimate the effect of the gilti rules due to the significant complexity of the rules and the fact that the information necessary could not be attained prepared or analyzed on a timely basis therefore we have not made any adjustment related to the potential gilti tax and have not made a policy decision regarding whether to record deferred taxes thereon 

finally as per interpretive guidance issued by the us treasury on february 13 2018 a tax benefit of 312 which was recorded during the third quarter of 2017 was reversed during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the enactment of the tax act 

effective tax rate 

in 2017  our effective income tax rate of 322 was positively impacted by a net benefit of 360  as a result of the tax act the primary impacts of which are discussed above as well as excess tax benefits on employee sharebased payments partially offset by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances 

in 2016  our effective income tax rate of 238  was positively impacted by a benefit of 446  related to refunds to be claimed on future amended us federal returns for tax years 2014 and 2015 primarily related to foreign tax credits and to a lesser extent research and development credits based on the conclusion of multiyear studies the settlement of 2011 and 2012 income tax audits which included the recognition of certain previously unrecognized tax benefits of 234  the reversal of valuation allowances of 122  as a consequence of the disposition of certain businesses in continental europe excess tax benefits on employee sharebased payments and various changes in state income tax laws as well as the recognition of previously unrecognized state tax benefits as a result of a lapse in statute of limitations the positive impacts to our tax rates were partially offset by a revaluation of deferred tax assets as a result of a statutory tax rate change in continental europe losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances and by losses on sales of businesses for which we did not receive a full tax benefit 

in 2015  our effective income tax rate of 371  was negatively impacted primarily by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances and from the losses on sales of businesses for which we did not receive a full tax benefit the negative impacts to our tax rates were partially offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the reversal of valuation allowances in continental europe and the settlement of a 2010 income tax audit

during 2017  cmg revenue decreased by 421  compared to 2016  comprised of a slight decrease in organic revenue of 02  the effect of net divestitures of 326  and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 93  the organic revenue decrease in our domestic market was mainly driven by decreases in our public relations agencies and branding businesses partially offset by growth at our sports marketing businesses in our international markets the organic increase was primarily driven by growth at our public relations and sports marketing businesses across all regions partially offset by a decrease in passthrough revenue related to certain projects where we acted as principal that decreased in size or did not recur in our events business in 2017 most notably in the united kingdom the impact of which is also reflected as a comparable reduction in office and general expenses 



during 2016  cmg revenue increased by 588  compared to 2015  comprised of an organic revenue increase of 527  and the effect of net acquisitions of 370  largely offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 309  the organic revenue increase in our international markets was driven by our public relations businesses primarily in the asia pacific region as well as our events business where we had an increase in the united kingdom offset by a decrease in the asia pacific region the domestic organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our public relations businesses primarily in the technology and telecom and healthcare sectors offset by a decline in our events marketing business

segment operating income 



operating income increased during 2017  when compared to 2016  comprised of a decrease in revenue of 421  as discussed above a decrease in salaries and related expenses of 280  and a decrease in office and general expenses of 169  the decrease in salaries and related expenses was primarily due to lower discretionary bonuses and incentive expense as well as a decrease in base salaries benefits and tax the decrease in office and general expenses was primarily due to decreases in adjustments to contingent acquisition obligations as compared to the prior year 

operating income increased during 2016  when compared to 2015  due to an increase in revenue of 588  as discussed above and a decrease in office and general expenses of 37  partially offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses of 388  the increase in salaries and related expenses was attributable to an increase in base salaries benefits and tax primarily due to increases in our workforce to support business growth over the last twelve months the decrease in office and general expenses was primarily due to lower production expenses related to passthrough costs which are also reflected in revenue for certain projects in which we acted as principal that decreased in size or did not recur during the current year 

corporate and other 

certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line item within total segment operating income and include corporate office expenses as well as shared service center and certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions salaries and related expenses include salaries longterm incentives annual bonuses and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees office and general expenses primarily include professional fees related to internal control compliance financial statement audits and legal information technology and other consulting services that are engaged and managed through the corporate office office and general expenses also include rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees a portion of centrally managed expenses are allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the planned revenues of each of the operating units amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technologyrelated projects which are allocated based on utilization 

corporate and other expenses decreased during 2017  by 206  to 1266  compared to 2016  primarily due to lower annual incentive expense corporate and other expenses increased during 2016  by 54  to 1472  compared to 2015  

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow overview 

the following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity capital resources and uses of capital 





   

operating activities 

due to the seasonality of our business we typically use cash from working capital in the first nine months of a year with the largest impact in the first quarter and generate cash from working capital in the fourth quarter driven by the seasonally strong media spending by our clients quarterly and annual working capital results are impacted by the fluctuating annual media spending budgets of our clients as well as their changing media spending patterns throughout each year across various countries 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients across various countries affects our working capital and operating cash flow and can be volatile in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients the amounts involved which substantially exceed our revenues primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments for example while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2017  was 8818  which was an increase of 3690  as compared to 2016  primarily as a result of an improvement in working capital usage of 3850  working capital in 2017 benefited from the spending patterns of our clients compared to 2016 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2016  was 5128  which was a decrease of 1757  as compared to 2015  primarily as a result of an increase in working capital usage of 3150  our net working capital usage in 2016  was primarily attributable to our media businesses and the shifting of several clients’ media spending budgets into the third quarter from the fourth quarter in 2016 and the corresponding payments to media suppliers thereafter 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during 2017  primarily consisted of payments for capital expenditures of 1559  related mostly to leasehold improvements and computer hardware and software 

net cash used in investing activities during 2016  primarily consisted of payments for capital expenditures of 2007  related mostly to leasehold improvements and computer hardware and software and payments for acquisitions of 520  net of cash acquired 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during 2017  was primarily driven by the redemption of all 3000 in aggregate principal amount of the 225 senior notes due 2017 the repurchase of 137  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 3001  including fees and the payment of dividends of 2803  

net cash used in financing activities during 2016  was primarily driven by the repurchase of 133  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 3033  including fees and the payment of dividends of 2384  

foreign exchange rate changes 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in an increase of 168  in 2017  primarily a result of the australian dollar strengthening against the us dollar as of december 31 2017  compared to december 31 2016  

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in an increase of 116  in 2016  primarily a result of the brazilian real strengthening against the us dollar as of december 31 2016  compared to december 31 2015  



liquidity outlook 

we expect our cash flow from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months we also have a committed corporate credit facility uncommitted lines of credit and a commercial paper program available to support our operating needs we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity with flexibility over significant uses of cash including our capital expenditures cash used for new acquisitions our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

from time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional funds or otherwise improve our liquidity profile enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors which include those specific to us such as our credit ratings and those related to the financial markets such as the amount or terms of available credit there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity or continue to access existing sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

funding requirements 

our most significant funding requirements include our operations noncancelable operating lease obligations capital expenditures acquisitions common stock dividends taxes and debt service additionally we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests 

notable funding requirements include 

 the following summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations and commitments as of december 31 2017  and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 





 

share repurchase program 

in february 2017 the board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to 3000 excluding fees of our common stock the 2017 share repurchase program which was in addition to the remaining amount available to 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

be repurchased from the 3000 authorization made by the board in february 2016 the 2016 share repurchase program we fully utilized the 2016 share repurchase program during the third quarter of 2017 as of december 31 2017  1555  remained available for repurchase under the 2017 share repurchase program 

on february 14 2018  we announced that our board had approved a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to 3000  excluding fees of our common stock the new authorization is in addition to any amounts remaining for repurchase under the 2017 share repurchase program there is no expiration date associated with the share repurchase programs 

we may effect such repurchases through open market purchases trading plans established in accordance with sec rules derivative transactions or other means we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in future periods although the timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements 

financing and sources of funds 

substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries below is a summary of our sources of liquidity 

at december 31 2017  we held 5984  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in foreign subsidiaries the company has historically asserted that its unremitted foreign earnings are permanently reinvested and therefore had not recorded deferred taxes on such amounts the tax act provides a us tax exemption for dividends of certain foreign earnings the tax act may provide additional flexibility in the company’s taxefficient access to global cash but is expected to have limited impact to net domestic liquidity the company is still evaluating whether to continue its indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of the tax act the evaluation is not yet complete any change to the assertion will be accounted for as part of the change in tax law 

credit agreements 

we maintain a committed corporate credit facility which has been amended and restated from time to time the credit agreement we use our credit agreement to increase our financial flexibility to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries and to support our commercial paper program the credit agreement is a revolving facility expiring in october 2022 under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 15000  or the equivalent in other currencies the company has the ability to increase the commitments under the credit agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to 2500  provided the company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of 500  or the equivalent in other currencies our obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured as of december 31 2017  there were no  borrowings under the credit agreement however we had 84  of letters of credit under the credit agreement which reduced our total availability to 14916  

under the credit agreement we can elect to receive advances bearing interest based on either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate each as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin that is determined based on our credit ratings as of december 31 2017  the applicable margin was 010  for base rate advances and 110  for eurocurrency rate advances letter of credit fees accrue on the average daily aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at a rate equal to the applicable margin for eurocurrency rate advances and fronting fees accrue on the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at an annual rate of 025  we also pay a facility fee at an annual rate that is determined based on our credit ratings which as of december 31 2017  was 015  on the aggregate lending commitment under the credit agreement 

the table below sets forth the financial covenants in effect as of december 31 2017  





 

as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with all of our covenants in the credit agreement if we were unable to comply with our covenants in the future we would seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders but there is no assurance that 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver if we were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver the credit facility could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal in addition under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility 

we also have uncommitted lines of credit with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some of our operations as of december 31 2017  the company had uncommitted lines of credit in an aggregate amount of 9262  under which we had outstanding borrowings of 849 classified as shortterm borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet the average amount outstanding during 2017  was 2238  with a weightedaverage interest rate of approximately 29  

commercial paper 

in june 2017  the company established a commercial paper program under which the company was authorized to issue unsecured commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of 10000  which was increased to 15000  on october 25 2017  borrowings under the program are supported by the credit agreement described above proceeds of the commercial paper are used for working capital and general corporate purposes including the repayment of maturing indebtedness and other shortterm liquidity needs the maturities of the commercial paper vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue as of december 31 2017  there was no commercial paper outstanding from the date the program was first utilized through december 31 2017  the average amount outstanding under the program was 4774  with a weightedaverage interest rate of 15 and a weightedaverage maturity of seventeen days 

cash pooling 

we aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the united states we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several ipg agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all agencies does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of bank overdrafts under all of our pooling arrangements and as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the amounts netted were 14120  and 13006  respectively 

debt credit ratings 

our debt credit ratings as of february 14 2018 are listed below 



we are rated investmentgrade by moodys investors service sp global ratings and fitch ratings in june 2017 we received from the credit rating agencies the shortterm credit ratings set forth above with respect to our commercial paper the most recent update to our longterm credit ratings occurred in april 2017 when sp global ratings upgraded our rating from bbb to bbb with a stable outlook a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity either adverse or favorable because among other things they could affect funding costs in or the ability to access the capital markets or otherwise for example our credit agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a longterm credit ratings grid 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our consolidated financial statements management has discussed 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies in arranging for such services it is possible that we will enter into global regional and local agreements agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements 

revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the price is fixed or determinable iii collectability is reasonably assured and iv services have been performed depending on the terms of a client contract fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways proportional performance input or output straightline or monthly basis or completed contract 

depending on the terms of the client contract revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed commissions performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to either qualitative or quantitative goals or both performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client the classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments if the judgments change there can be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods 

the majority of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less passthrough expenses charged to a client in most cases the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our consolidated financial statements because of various passthrough expenses such as production and media costs we assess whether our agency or the thirdparty supplier is the primary obligor and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment in addition we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor because we operate broadly as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting accordingly we generally record revenue net of passthrough charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business in those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal primarily sales promotion and event sports and entertainment marketing we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as office and general expenses in general we also report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenueproducing transactions 

as we provide services as part of our core operations we generally incur incidental expenses which in practice are commonly referred to as “outofpocket” expenses these expenses often include expenses related to airfare mileage hotel stays outoftown meals and telecommunication charges we record the reimbursements received for such incidental expenses as revenue with a corresponding offset to office and general expense 

the determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments if we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our reported results if it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin 

we receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that based on the terms of our contracts and local law are either remitted to our clients or retained by us if amounts are to be passed through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or if retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned 

in may 2014 the fasb issued amended guidance on revenue recognition which requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services we have elected to adopt the standard effective january 1 2018 using the 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

full retrospective method the standard which accelerates the recognition of revenue primarily as a result of estimating variable consideration mostly impacts the timing of revenue recognition between quarters but also can affect to a lesser extent the amount of annual revenue recognized although we have determined that the standard results in an increase in the number of performance obligations within certain of our contractual arrangements this is not expected to materially impact the amount or timing of revenue recognized the standard will also result in an increase in third party costs of approximately 11000 to 13000 being included in revenue and costs primarily in connection with our events businesses which has no impact on operating income net income or cash flows the increase to retained earnings as of december 31 2017 as a result of adopting the standard is not material 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes us federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 

in response to the enactment of the tax act the sec issued sab 118 on december 22 2017 which acknowledges that the information necessary to determine such income tax effects may not be sufficiently available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting under us gaap sab 118 allows for the reporting of provisional amounts for those specific tax effects for which a reasonable estimate can be made and for no amounts to be recorded where a reasonable estimate cannot be made any subsequent adjustments to reported amounts will be made over the measurement period which begins in the reporting period that includes the tax acts enactment date and ends when an entity has obtained prepared and analyzed the information that is needed in order to complete the accounting requirements under us gaap not to exceed one year from the enactment date we have reasonably estimated and recorded provisional amounts resulting from the enactment of the tax act refer to note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets which is primarily dependent on future earnings a valuation allowance shall be recognized when based on available evidence it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the factors used in assessing valuation allowances include all available evidence such as past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in circumstances where there is negative evidence establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance conversely a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance further in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings 

the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally guidance is provided for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments we evaluate our tax positions using the “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of october 1 st  each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we have 11  reporting units that were subject to the 2017  annual impairment testing our annual impairment review as of october 1 2017  did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units 

in performing our annual impairment review we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings financial performance and other relevant entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or clients as well as pending litigation if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the entity is required to determine the fair value and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value otherwise no additional testing is required 

for reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value a quantitative impairment test is performed for our annual impairment test we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units equity to the carrying value of their net assets the sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the quantitative impairment test is failed and impaired goodwill is written down to its fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

for our 2017  and 2016  annual impairment tests we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for eight and seven reporting units and performed the quantitative impairment test for three and four reporting units respectively for the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances including financial performance macroeconomic conditions and entityspecific factors such as client wins and losses based on this assessment we have concluded that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value therefore no additional testing was required 

the 2017  and 2016  fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data we generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our analysis for the income approach we used projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth profit margins terminal value growth rates capital expenditures projections assumed tax rates discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management for the market approach we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparablecompany market multiples 

these estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit the discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit for the 2017  test the discount rate we used for our reporting units tested was 115  and the terminal value growth rate was 30  the terminal value growth rate represents the expected longterm growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides and the global economy for the 2017  test the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 20  and 60  factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit we believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period actual results of operations cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation and it is possible that differences and changes could be material a deterioration in profitability adverse market conditions significant client losses changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future 

we also perform a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit where the low end of the range increases discount rates by 05 and the high end of the range decreases discount rates by 05 we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the quantitative impairment test 

the table below displays the midpoint of the fair value range for each reporting unit tested in the 2017  and 2016  annual impairment tests indicating that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units by greater than 20 when factoring in a 05 increase in discount rate our results of the 2017  and 2016  tests indicate that the fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 20 for all reporting units except for reporting unit b whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 175 in 2016 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 



based on the analysis described above for the reporting units for which we performed the quantitative impairment test we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of october 1 2017  because these reporting units passed the test as the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values 

we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets these assets are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7  and 15  years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations we determine our discount rates for our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and significant foreign pension plans based on either a bond selectionsettlement approach or bond yield curve approach using the bond selectionsettlement approach we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments using the bond yield curve approach we determine the discount rate by matching the plans cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve both approaches utilize highquality aarated corporate bonds and the plans projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments which is then used to develop a single discount rate in countries where markets for highquality longterm aa corporate bonds are not well developed a portfolio of longterm government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate 

the discount rate used to calculate net pension and postretirement benefit costs is determined at the beginning of each year for the year ended december 31 2017  discount rates of 420  for the domestic pension plan and 405  for the domestic postretirement benefit plan and a weightedaverage discount rate of 252  for the significant foreign pension plans were used to calculate 2017  net pension and postretirement benefit costs a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2017  net pension and postretirement benefit cost by 02  

the discount rate used to measure our benefit obligations is determined at the end of each year as of december 31 2017  we used discount rates of 370  for the domestic pension plan and 365  for the domestic postretirement benefit plan and a weightedaverage discount rate of 236  for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the december 31 2017  benefit obligation by approximately 280  and 300  respectively 

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions current and expected market conditions risk premiums associated with asset classes and longterm inflation rates we determine both a shortterm and longterm view and then select a longterm rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities 

for 2017  the weightedaverage expected rates of return of 700  and 466  were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively for 2018  we plan to use expected rates of return of 700 and 470 for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held a lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

amounts in millions 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items from time to time we use derivative instruments pursuant to established guidelines and policies to manage some portion of these risks derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rates 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations the majority of our debt approximately 94  and 93  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively bears interest at fixed rates we do have debt with variable interest rates but a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a 10 change in interest rates is summarized below 



we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates we did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2017  

we had 7910  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2017  that we generally invest in conservative shortterm bank deposits or securities the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements during 2017  and 2016  we had interest income of 194  and 201  respectively based on our 2017  results a 100 basispoint increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately 79  assuming that all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from yearend 2017  levels 

foreign currency rates 

we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations the foreign currencies that most impacted our results during 2017  included the british pound sterling and to a lesser extent brazilian real and south african rand based on 2017  exchange rates and operating results if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10 we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4  assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2017  levels 

the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency mitigating transaction risk however certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes 

we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency the us dollar and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary 

credit and market risks 

balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients we invest our cash primarily in investmentgrade shortterm securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 

our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods

principal markets 

our agencies are located in over 100  countries including every significant world market our geographic revenue breakdown is listed below 



for further information on a geographical basis regarding revenues for each of the last three years and longlived assets for each of the last two years see note 12  to the consolidated financial statements 

sources of revenue 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world our revenues are directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients and our ability to win new clients most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 90 days 

revenues for the creation planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate the difference is the commission that we earn which we either retain in full or share with the client depending on the nature of the applicable services agreement 

we also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion event marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients as is customary in the advertising and marketing industries to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have 

received funds from our clients and in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor 

our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work that is typically completed during the fourth quarter fee revenue recognized on a completedcontract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at december 31 



see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition accounting policies 

clients 

our large and diverse client base includes many of the most recognizable companies and brands throughout the world our holding company structure allows us to maintain a diversified client base across and within a full range of industry sectors in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 20  and 19  of revenue in 2016  and 2015  respectively our largest client accounted for approximately 4  of revenue for both 2016  and 2015  based on revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  our largest client sectors in alphabetical order were auto and transportation healthcare and technology and telecom we represent several different clients brands or divisions within each of these sectors in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency brands representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time 

we operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry our operating companies compete against other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships 

personnel 

as of december 31 2016  we employed approximately 49800  people of whom approximately 19900  were employed in the united states because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success we conduct extensive employee training and development throughout our agencies and benchmark our compensation programs against those of our industry for their competitiveness and effectiveness in recruitment and retention there is keen competition for qualified employees

risk factors 

tableend

we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition see also statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and other providers of creative marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants 

the client’s perception of the quality of our agencies’ creative work and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services may also be an important competitive consideration on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people freedom of entry into the industry is almost unlimited and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

 many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time and we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions our clients may choose to terminate their contracts or reduce their relationships with us on a relatively short time frame and for any reason a relatively small number of clients contribute a significant portion of our revenue in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 20  of revenue in 2016  a substantial decline in a large client’s advertising and marketing spending or the loss of a significant part of its business could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 

our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest or our own exclusivity arrangements with certain clients these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

 we are exposed to risks associated with weak regional or global economic conditions and increased disruption in the financial markets the global economy continues to be volatile uncertainty about the strength of the global economy generally or economic conditions in certain regions and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general in the past some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses this pattern may recur in the future furthermore unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations 

 our employees including creative digital research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most valuable assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and other factors which may be beyond our control changes to us or other immigration policies that restrain the flow of professional talent may inhibit our ability to staff our offices or projects in addition the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and writeoffs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients and if these effects were severe the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity 

furthermore in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities to the extent possible we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients however if clients are unable to pay for commitments that we have entered into on their behalf or if clients seek to significantly delay or otherwise alter payment terms there could be an adverse effect on our working capital which would negatively impact our operating cash flow 

 we are a global business with agencies located in over 100  countries including every significant world market operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues approximately 40  in 2016  these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation currency variation exchange control restrictions and difficult social political or economic conditions we also must comply with applicable us local and other international anticorruption laws export controls and economic sanctions which can be complex and stringent in all jurisdictions where we operate failure to comply or to implement business practices that sufficiently prevent corruption could result in significant remediation expense and expose us to significant civil and criminal penalties and reputational harm 

given our substantial operations in the united kingdom and continental europe we face uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of the uk’s june 2016 referendum in which voters approved the united kingdom’s exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” it is possible that brexit will cause increased regulatory and legal complexities and create uncertainty surrounding our business including our relationships with existing and future clients suppliers and employees which could have an adverse effect on our business financial results and operations 

in developing countries or regions we may face further risks such as slower receipt of payments nationalization social and economic instability currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries 

in addition because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan renminbi euro indian rupee and japanese yen fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies including the persistent strength of the us dollar in recent periods may adversely affect our financial results in particular brexit has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates especially between the us dollar and the british pound sterling 

 our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation regulation judicial actions or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare our business is also subject to specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products existing and proposed laws and regulations in particular in the european union and the united states concerning user privacy use of personal information and online tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internetbased and digital marketing legislators agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products such as alcohol or tobacco and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients’ goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently on our revenues furthermore we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial 

 we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved we may be unsuccessful 

in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity our forecasts of the investment’s future performance also factor into the initial consideration when actual financial results differ our returns on the investment could be adversely affected 

we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees businesses assets or systems into our organization including with respect to our internal policies and required controls we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investments operations furthermore it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all talent is among our most valuable assets and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel acquisition and integration activity may also divert management’s attention and other corporate resources from other business needs if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

 we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information developing new business opportunities and digital products and processing business transactions the incidence of malicious technologyrelated events such as cyberattacks computer hacking computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide power outages equipment failure natural disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis with a large number of agencies and legal entities and the resulting size diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase our potential vulnerability to such breakdowns malicious intrusions or attacks 

likewise data privacy breaches as well as improper use of social media by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data such as personally identifiable information strategic plans and trade secrets could be exposed to third parties or to the general public we operate worldwide and the legal rules governing data transfers are often complex conflicting unclear or everchanging we also utilize third parties including thirdparty “cloud” computing services to store transfer or process data and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business 

any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability be expensive to remedy result in a loss of our or our clients’ or vendors’ proprietary information and damage our reputation efforts to develop implement and maintain security measures are costly may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated 

 we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and fixed assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance 

as of december 31 2016  we have substantial amounts of longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet including approximately 37 billion  of goodwill future events including our financial performance market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies loss of a significant client’s business or strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets as well as our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 from time to time we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them see statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 we maintain a 1 billion committed credit facility the “credit agreement” to increase our financial flexibility if credit under the credit agreement were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity could be adversely affected the credit agreement contains financial covenants and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them for example compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders and our costs under the credit agreement could increase if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver the credit agreement could be terminated and any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration 

furthermore if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook see “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness including covenants and interest rates we could be adversely affected if our credit ratings were downgraded or if they were significantly weaker than those of our competitors our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

 although as a nonmanufacturing service business we generally are not directly impacted by current laws and regulations with respect to climate change and other sustainability concerns we could incur related costs indirectly through our clients increasingly our clients request that we comply with their own social responsibility sustainability or other business policies or standards which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations before they commence or continue doing business with us our compliance with these policies and related certification requirements could be costly and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business relationships or reputation further if clients’ costs are adversely affected by climate change or related laws and regulations this could negatively impact their spending on our advertising and marketing services we could also face increased prices from our own suppliers that face climate changerelated costs and that seek to pass on their increased costs to their customers

executive summary 

our organic revenue increase in 2016  was driven by growth throughout all our geographic regions which was a result of growth with existing clients and net new business wins the growth in our domestic market was across nearly all of our major disciplines our international organic increase was across all disciplines with notable contributions from the united kingdom the latin america region and continental europe we continued to have strong growth in demand for our full range of services including creative digital media and marketing services across most of our regional markets we carefully managed our operating expenses which reflected investments made in our agencies to support our new business portfolio service our existing clients and grow our capabilities 

overall demand for our services by clients remains solid though with challenging economic conditions in some parts of the world marketers continue to show a measure of caution we continue to derive substantial benefit from our diversified client base our global footprint and the broad range and strength of our professional offerings we continued to enhance our businesses during 2016  by making investments in creative and strategic talent that emphasize our growth priorities fastgrowth digital marketing channels highgrowth geographic regions creative talent and strategic world markets we believe our continued investment in tools technology and process improvements will create efficiencies in the delivery of our services 

we continued to enhance value to our shareholders through common stock dividends share repurchases and improvements in our balance sheet basic earnings per share available to ipg common stockholders for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were 153  111  and 114  per share respectively diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  were 149  109  and 112  per share respectively basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2016 included a net positive impact of 023 and 022 per share respectively from various tax items as discussed in further detail in the  income taxes  and  earnings per share  sections of our mda both basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2016 included a negative impact of 010 per share from the losses on sales of businesses due to completed dispositions and the classification of certain assets as held for sale both basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2015 included a negative impact of 012 per share from the losses on sales of businesses due to completed dispositions and the classification of certain assets as held for sale both basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2014 included a positive impact of 016 per share from the net reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in continental europe basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2014 also included a negative impact of 001 and 002 per share respectively from the loss on early extinguishment of debt net of tax

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

the following tables present a summary of financial performance for the year ended december 31 2016  as compared with the same periods in 2015  and 2014  



when we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the remainder we call organic change which indicates how our underlying business performed the performance metrics that we use to evaluate our results include the organic change in revenue salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses and the components of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue additionally in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by geographic region and also by business sector in which we focus on our top 100 clients which typically constitute approximately 55 to 60 of our annual consolidated revenues 

the change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the priorperiod reported results using the currentperiod exchange rates and comparing these priorperiod adjusted amounts to the priorperiod reported results although the us dollar is our reporting currency a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies therefore our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar affect our consolidated results of operations and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact on us related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region the foreign currencies that most impacted our results during 2016  included the british pound sterling and to a lesser extent the argentine peso brazilian real and japanese yen 

for purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred during the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions

consolidated results of operations 

revenue 

our revenue is directly impacted by the retention and spending levels of existing clients and by our ability to win new clients most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter in the events marketing business revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete when we act as principal for these projects we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs are incurred as passthrough costs in office and general expenses 



during 2016  our revenue increased by 2328  or 31  compared to 2015  comprised of an organic revenue increase of 3772  or 50  and the effect of net acquisitions of 153  partially offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 1597  our organic revenue increase was throughout all geographic regions attributable to a combination of higher spending from existing clients and net client wins in most client sectors notably in the healthcare and technology and telecom sectors the organic increase in our domestic market was driven by growth across nearly all disciplines most notably at our digital specialist agencies and advertising businesses in our international markets the organic revenue increase was driven by growth across all disciplines most notably at our media business in all geographic regions primarily in continental europe led by germany as well as our events business where we had an increase in the united kingdom offset by a decrease in the asia pacific region also contributing to our international organic revenue increase were our digital specialist agencies primarily in the latin america region and the other region led by canada and our public relations agencies primarily in the united kingdom and the asia pacific region 



during 2015  our revenue increased by 767  or 10  compared to 2014  comprised of an organic revenue increase of 4615  or 61  and the effect of net acquisitions of 237  largely offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 4085  our organic revenue increase was throughout all geographic regions attributable to a combination of net client wins and higher spending in most client sectors notably in the technology and telecom and healthcare sectors the organic increase in our domestic market was driven by growth across most disciplines most notably at our advertising and media businesses our digital specialist agencies and our public relations agencies in our international markets the organic revenue increase was driven by growth across all disciplines most notably at our advertising business in the asia pacific region predominantly in china india and singapore

operating expenses 



in 2016  our change in revenue of 31  from 2015  outpaced an increase in total operating expenses of 25  resulting in operating margin expansion to 120  from 115  in 2015  our change in revenue of 10  from 2014  compared with a decrease in total operating expenses of 01  resulting in operating margin expansion to 115  from 105  our operating income grew 76  in 2016  to 9380  and 106  in 2015  to 8719  

salaries and related expenses 

salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs employee performance incentives including annual bonus and longterm incentive awards costs for temporary workers severance and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with shortterm changes in revenue levels however salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of the hiring of personnel including freelancers to support revenue growth and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards additionally we may take severance actions in areas where we have or anticipate decreases in operating performance or to enhance our teams or leadership changes in our incentive awards mix can impact futureperiod expense as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year in which they are earned and longterm incentive awards are expensed over the performance period generally three years factors impacting longterm incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting assumptions regarding forfeiture rates the change in our stock price actual results and changes to our projected results which could impact the achievement of certain performance targets 



 salaries and related expenses in 2016  increased by 1804  compared to 2015  comprised of an organic increase of 2779  and the effect of net acquisitions of 22  partially offset by a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 997  the organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in base salaries benefits and tax as a result of increases in our workforce at businesses and in regions where we had revenue growth or new business wins over the last twelve months and higher longterm incentive awards expense as a result of improved financial performance our staff cost ratio defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue increased in 2016  to 642  from 638  when compared to the prior year 

 salaries and related expenses in 2015  increased by 373  compared to 2014  comprised of an organic increase of 2703  and the effect of net acquisitions of 171  largely offset by a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 2501  the organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in base salaries benefits and temporary help primarily due to increases in our workforce at businesses where we had revenue growth or new business wins most notably in the domestic market and in the asia pacific region also contributing to the organic increase was higher incentive awards expense resulting from improved financial performance our staff cost ratio decreased in 2015  to 638  from 640  in 2014

office and general expenses in 2016  decreased by 137  compared to 2015  due to a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 436  and the effect of net divestitures of 87  partially offset by an organic increase of 386  the organic increase was attributable to higher occupancy costs as well as increases in adjustments to contingent acquisition obligations partially offset by lower production expenses related to passthrough costs which are also reflected in revenue for certain projects that decreased in size or did not recur during 2016 our office and general expense ratio defined as office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue decreased in 2016  to 238  from 247  in 2015

expenses and other income

for 2015  net interest expense increased by 55  as compared to 2014  primarily due to lower interest income in the current year cash interest expense decreased primarily due to the retirement of our 625 senior unsecured notes due 2014 the 625 notes in the second quarter of 2014 partially offset by the issuance of our 420 senior notes due 2024 the 420 notes in the second quarter of 2014 noncash interest expense increased primarily due to revaluations of mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests

in 2015  our effective income tax rate of 371  was negatively impacted primarily by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances and from the losses on sales of businesses for which we did not receive a full tax benefit the negative impacts to our tax rates were partially offset by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the reversal of valuation allowances in continental europe and the settlement of a 2010 income tax audit 

in 2014  our effective income tax rate of 300  was positively impacted from changes to our valuations allowances of 660 the primary drivers of the net change were associated with a valuation allowance reversal of 1248 in one jurisdiction partially offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance of 572 in another jurisdiction both in continental europe in addition our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances

to contingent acquisition obligations as compared to the prior year partially offsetting the decrease in office and general expenses was a net increase in reserves for certain contingencies the increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily driven by increases in our workforce at businesses and in regions where we had revenue growth from existing clients and net new business wins also contributing to the increase in salaries and related expenses was higher incentive awards expense

revenue 



during 2016  cmg revenue increased by 588  compared to 2015  comprised of an organic revenue increase of 527  and the effect of net acquisitions of 370  largely offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 309  the organic revenue increase in our international markets was driven by our public relations businesses primarily in the asia pacific region as well as our events businesses where we had an increase in the united kingdom offset by a decrease in the asia pacific region the domestic organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our public relations businesses primarily in the technology and telecom and healthcare sectors offset by a decline in our events marketing business 



during 2015  cmg revenue increased by 81  compared to 2014  comprised of an organic revenue increase of 519  and the effect of net acquisitions of 111  largely offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 549  in our international markets the organic revenue increase was driven by our public relations and events marketing businesses predominantly in the asia pacific region the domestic organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to growth at our public relations business partially offset by a decline at our events marketing business 

segment operating income 



operating income increased during 2016  when compared to 2015  due to an increase in revenue of 588  and a decrease in office and general expenses of 37  partially offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses of 389  the increase in salaries and related expenses was attributable to an increase in base salaries benefits and tax primarily due to increases in our workforce to support business growth over the last twelve months the decrease in office and general expenses was primarily due to lower production expenses related to passthrough costs which are also reflected in revenue for certain projects in which we acted as principal that decreased in size or did not recur during the current year 

operating income increased during 2015  when compared to 2014  due to an increase in revenue of 81  and a decrease in office and general expenses of 220  partially offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses of 277  the decrease in office and general expenses was primarily due to lower production expenses related to passthrough costs which are also reflected in revenue for certain projects in which we acted as principal that decreased in size or did not recur during the current year the increase in salaries and related expenses was due to increases in our workforce most notably at our public relations business to support business growth and increases due to acquisitions

certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line item within total segment operating income and include corporate office expenses as well as shared service center and certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions salaries and related expenses include salaries longterm incentives annual bonuses and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees office and general expenses primarily include professional fees related to internal control compliance financial statement audits and legal information technology and other consulting services that are engaged and managed through the corporate office office and general expenses also include rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees a portion of centrally managed expenses are allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the planned revenues of each of the operating units amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technologyrelated projects which are allocated based on utilization 

corporate and other expenses increased during 2016  by 54  to 1472  compared to 2015  corporate and other expenses decreased during 2015  by 77  to 1418  compared to 2014  

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow overview 

the following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity capital resources and uses of capital 





   

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2016  was 5134  which was a decrease of 1756  as compared to 2015  primarily as a result of an increase in working capital usage of 3149  due to the seasonality of our business we typically use cash from working capital in the first half of a year and generate cash from working capital in the second half of a year with the largest impacts generally in the first and fourth quarters our net working capital usage in 2016  was primarily attributable to our media businesses 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2015  was 6890  which was a decrease of 74  as compared to 2014  our net working capital usage in 2015 was primarily attributable to our media businesses 

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers 

our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments for example while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during 2016  primarily consisted of payments for capital expenditures of 2007  related mostly to leasehold improvements and computer hardware and software and payments for acquisitions of 520  net of cash acquired 

net cash used in investing activities during 2015  primarily related to payments for capital expenditures of 1611  largely attributable to purchases of leasehold improvements and computer hardware 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during 2016  is primarily driven by the repurchase of 133  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 3033  including fees and the payment of dividends of 2384  on our common stock 

net cash used in financing activities during 2015  primarily related to the repurchase of our common stock and payment of dividends we repurchased 136  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 2852  including fees and made dividend payments of 1955  on our common stock 

foreign exchange rate changes 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in an increase of 116  in 2016  primarily a result of the us dollar being weaker than the brazilian real as of december 31 2016  compared to december 31 2015  

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a decrease of 1561  in 2015  the decrease was primarily a result of the us dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies including the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar euro and south african rand as of december 31 2015  compared to december 31 2014  



liquidity outlook 

we expect our cash flow from operations cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months we also have a committed corporate credit facility as well as uncommitted facilities available to support our operating needs we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity with flexibility over significant uses of cash including our capital expenditures cash used for new acquisitions our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends 

from time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional funds or otherwise improve our liquidity profile enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors which include those specific to us such as our credit rating and those related to the financial markets such as the amount or terms of available credit there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

funding requirements 

our most significant funding requirements include our operations noncancelable operating lease obligations capital expenditures acquisitions common stock dividends taxes and debt service additionally we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests

 the following summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations and commitments as of december 31 2016  and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 





 

share repurchase program 

in february 2016 the board authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to 3000 excluding fees of our common stock the 2016 share repurchase program which was in addition to the remaining amount available to be repurchased from the 3000 authorization made by the board in february 2015 the 2015 share repurchase program we fully utilized the 2015 share repurchase program during the third quarter of 2016 as of december 31 2016  1554  remained available for repurchase under the 2016 share repurchase program 

on february 10 2017  we announced that our board had approved a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to 3000  excluding fees of our common stock the 2017 share repurchase program the new authorization is in addition to any amounts remaining for repurchase under the 2016 share repurchase program there is no expiration date associated with the share repurchase programs 

we may effect such repurchases through open market purchases trading plans established in accordance with sec rules derivative transactions or other means we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in future periods although the timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements

financing and sources of funds 

substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries below is a summary of our sources of liquidity 





 

at december 31 2016  we held 6980  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in foreign subsidiaries we have not provided us federal income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we consider such earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states if in the future we distribute these amounts to the united states an additional provision for the us income and foreign withholding taxes net of foreign tax credits could be necessary 

credit agreements 

we maintain a committed corporate credit facility to increase our financial flexibility which has been amended and restated from time to time the credit agreement the credit agreement is a revolving facility expiring in october 2020 under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 10000  or the equivalent in other currencies the company has the ability to increase the commitments under the credit agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to 2500  provided the company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of 2000  or the equivalent in other currencies we use our credit agreement to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries our obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

under the credit agreement we can elect to receive advances bearing interest based on either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate each as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin that is determined based on our credit ratings as of december 31 2016  the applicable margin was 010  for base rate advances and 110  for eurocurrency rate advances letter of credit fees accrue on the average daily aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at a rate equal to the applicable margin for eurocurrency rate advances and fronting fees accrue on the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at an annual rate of 025  we also pay a facility fee at an annual rate that is determined based on our credit ratings which as of december 31 2016  was 015  on the aggregate lending commitment under the credit agreement 

the table below sets forth the financial covenants in effect as of december 31 2016  





 

as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with all of our covenants in the credit agreement if we were unable to comply with our covenants in the future we would seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver if we were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver the credit facility could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal in addition under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

we also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates as of december 31 2016  there were borrowings under some of the uncommitted facilities to manage working capital needs we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations the weightedaverage interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted credit facilities was approximately 3  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  

cash pooling 

we aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the united states we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several ipg agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of bank overdrafts under all of our pooling arrangements and as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the amounts netted were 13006  and 16083  respectively 

debt credit ratings 

our longterm debt credit ratings as of february 10 2017  are listed below 



we are rated investmentgrade by moodys investors service sp global ratings and fitch ratings the most recent updates to our credit ratings occurred in july 2016 when fitch ratings revised our outlook from stable to positive and in april 2016 when moodys investors service upgraded our rating from baa3 to baa2 and sp global ratings revised our outlook from stable to positive a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity either adverse or favorable including among other things because they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise for example our credit agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our consolidated financial statements management has discussed with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies in arranging for such services it is possible that we will enter into global regional and local agreements agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements 

revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the price is fixed or determinable iii collectability is reasonably assured and iv services have been performed 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

depending on the terms of a client contract fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways proportional performance input or output straightline or monthly basis or completed contract 

depending on the terms of the client contract revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed commissions performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to either qualitative or quantitative goals or both performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client the classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments if the judgments change there can be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods 

the majority of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less passthrough expenses charged to a client in most cases the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our consolidated financial statements because of various passthrough expenses such as production and media costs we assess whether our agency or the thirdparty supplier is the primary obligor and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment in addition we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor because we operate broadly as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting accordingly we generally record revenue net of passthrough charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business in those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal primarily sales promotion and event sports and entertainment marketing we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as office and general expenses in general we also report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenueproducing transactions 

as we provide services as part of our core operations we generally incur incidental expenses which in practice are commonly referred to as “outofpocket” expenses these expenses often include expenses related to airfare mileage hotel stays outoftown meals and telecommunication charges we record the reimbursements received for such incidental expenses as revenue with a corresponding offset to office and general expense 

the determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments if we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our reported results if it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin 

we receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that based on the terms of our contracts and local law are either remitted to our clients or retained by us if amounts are to be passed through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or if retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned 

in may 2014 the fasb issued amended guidance on revenue recognition which requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services we expect to adopt the standard which is effective january 1 2018 using the full retrospective method however that determination is subject to the completion of our analysis of certain items while we continue to assess all potential impacts of the standard based upon our initial assessment we currently expect an impact to the timing of revenue recognition between quarters primarily as a result of estimating variable consideration we are still assessing whether the standard will result in a change in the number of performance obligations within our contractual arrangements and what impact if any the standard will have on our assessment of principal versus agent in connection with media buying production and studio work and our events businesses additionally under the new standard certain outofpocket expenses reimbursed by our clients will no longer be recorded in revenue 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes us federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 

we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets which is primarily dependent on future earnings a valuation allowance shall be recognized when based on available evidence it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

deferred tax assets will not be realized the factors used in assessing valuation allowances include all available evidence such as past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in circumstances where there is negative evidence establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance conversely a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance further in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings 

the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally guidance is provided for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments we evaluate our tax positions using the “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of october 1 st  each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we have 11  reporting units that were subject to the 2016  annual impairment testing our annual impairment review as of october 1 2016  did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units 

in performing our annual impairment review we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings financial performance and other relevant entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or clients as well as pending litigation if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the entity is required to determine the fair value and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value otherwise no additional testing is required 

for reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value the first step of the quantitative impairment test is performed for our annual impairment test we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units equity to the carrying value of their net assets the first step is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill the sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the first step of the quantitative impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value excluding goodwill impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

for our 2016  and 2015  annual impairment tests we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for seven and ten reporting units and performed the first step of a twostep quantitative impairment test for four and two reporting units respectively for the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances including financial performance macroeconomic conditions and entityspecific factors such as client wins and losses based on this assessment we have concluded 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value therefore no additional testing was required 

the 2016  and 2015  fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data we generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our analysis for the income approach we used projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth profit margins terminal value growth rates capital expenditures projections assumed tax rates discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management for the market approach we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparablecompany market multiples 

these estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit the discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit for the 2016  test the discount rate we used for our reporting units tested were between 95  and 110  and the terminal value growth rate for all four reporting units tested was 30  the terminal value growth rate represents the expected longterm growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides and the global economy for the 2016  test the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 30  and 50  factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit we believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period actual results of operations cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation and it is possible that differences and changes could be material a deterioration in profitability adverse market conditions significant client losses changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future 

we also perform a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit where the low end of the range increases discount rates by 05 and the high end of the range decreases discount rates by 05 we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the quantitative impairment test 

the table below displays the midpoint of the fair value range for each reporting unit tested in the 2016  and 2015  annual impairment tests indicating that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units by greater than 20 when factoring in a 05 increase in discount rate our results of the 2016 and 2015 tests indicate that the fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 20 for all reporting units except for reporting unit b whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 175 in 2016 



based on the analysis described above for the reporting units for which we performed the first step of the quantitative impairment test we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of october 1 2016  because these reporting units passed the first step of the test as the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values 

we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets these assets are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7  and 15  years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting

unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations we determine our discount rates for our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and significant foreign pension plans based on either a bond selectionsettlement approach or bond yield curve approach using the bond selectionsettlement approach we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments using the bond yield curve approach we determine the discount rate by matching the plans cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve both approaches utilize highquality aarated corporate bonds and the plans projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments which is then used to develop a single discount rate in countries where markets for highquality longterm aa corporate bonds are not well developed a portfolio of longterm government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate 

the discount rate used to calculate net pension and postretirement benefit costs is determined at the beginning of each year for the year ended december 31 2016  discount rates of 480  for the domestic pension plan and 465  for the postretirement benefit plan and a weightedaverage discount rate of 361  for the significant foreign pension plans were used to calculate 2016  net pension and postretirement benefit costs a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2016  net pension and postretirement benefit cost by approximately 04  

the discount rate used to measure our benefit obligations is determined at the end of each year as of december 31 2016  we used discount rates of 420  for the domestic pension plan and 405  for the domestic postretirement benefit plan and a weightedaverage discount rate of 252  for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the december 31 2016  benefit obligation by approximately 260  and 280  respectively 

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions current and expected market conditions risk premiums associated with asset classes and longterm inflation rates we determine both a shortterm and longterm view and then select a longterm rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities 

for 2016  the weightedaverage expected rates of return of 700  and 538  were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively for 2017  we plan to use expected rates of return of 700   and 466 for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held a lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost a 25 basispoint increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2016  net pension cost by approximately 10

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items from time to time we use derivative instruments pursuant to established guidelines and policies to manage some portion of these risks derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rates 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations the majority of our debt approximately 93  and 89  as of december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively bears interest at fixed rates we do have debt with variable interest rates but a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a 10 change in interest rates is summarized below 



we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates we do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2016  

we had 11006  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2016  that we generally invest in conservative shortterm bank deposits or securities the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements during 2016  and 2015  we had interest income of 201  and 228  respectively based on our 2016  results a 100 basispoint increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately 110  assuming that all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from yearend 2016  levels 

foreign currency rates 

we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations the foreign currencies that most impacted our results during 2016  included the british pound sterling and to a lesser extent the argentine peso brazilian real and japanese yen based on 2016  exchange rates and operating results if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10 we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4  assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2016  levels 

the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency mitigating transaction risk however certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes 

we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency the us dollar and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary 

credit and market risks 

balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients we invest our cash primarily in investmentgrade shortterm securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 

our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods

principal markets 

our agencies are located in over 100  countries including every significant world market our geographic revenue breakdown is listed below 



for further information regarding revenues and longlived assets on a geographical basis for each of the last three years see note 13  to the consolidated financial statements 

sources of revenue 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world our revenues are directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients and our ability to win new clients most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 90 days 

revenues for the creation planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate the difference is the commission that we earn which we either retain in full or share with the client depending on the nature of the applicable services agreement 

we also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion event marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients as is customary in the advertising and marketing industries to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients and in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges  generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor 

our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work that is typically completed during the fourth quarter fee revenue recognized on a completedcontract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at december 31 



see note 1  to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition accounting policies 

clients 

our large and diverse client base includes many of the most recognizable companies and brands throughout the world our holding company structure allows us to maintain a diversified client base across and within a full range of industry sectors in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 19  and 20  of revenue in 2015  and 2014  respectively our largest client accounted for approximately 4  and 5  of revenue for 2015  and 2014  respectively based on revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  our largest client sectors in alphabetical order were auto and transportation healthcare and tech and telecom we represent several different clients brands or divisions within each of these sectors in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency brands representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time 

we operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry our operating companies compete against other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships 

personnel 

as of december 31 2015  we employed approximately 49200  people of whom approximately 19900  were employed in the united states because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success we conduct extensive employee training and development throughout our agencies and benchmark our compensation programs against those of our industry for their competitiveness and effectiveness in recruitment and retention there is keen competition for qualified employees

risk factors 

tableend

we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition see also statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and other providers of creative marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants 

the client’s perception of the quality of our agencies’ creative work and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services may also be an important competitive consideration on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people freedom of entry into the industry is almost unlimited and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

 many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time and we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions our clients may choose to terminate their contracts or reduce their relationships with us on a relatively short time frame and for any reason a relatively small number of clients contribute a significant portion of our revenue in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 19  of revenue in 2015  a substantial decline in a large client’s advertising and marketing spending or the loss of a significant part of its business could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 

our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest or our own exclusivity arrangements with certain clients these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

 we are exposed to risks associated with weak regional or global economic conditions and increased disruption in the financial markets the global economy continues to be volatile uncertainty about the strength of the global economy generally or economic conditions in certain regions and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general in the past some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses this pattern may recur in the future furthermore unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations 

 our employees including creative digital research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most valuable assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and other factors which may be beyond our control in addition the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and writeoffs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients and if these effects were severe the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity 

furthermore in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities to the extent possible we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients however if clients are unable to pay for commitments that we have entered into on their behalf or if clients seek to significantly delay or otherwise alter payment terms there could be an adverse effect on our working capital which would negatively impact our operating cash flow 

 we are a global business with agencies located in over 100 countries including every significant world market operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues approximately 41  in 2015  these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation currency variation exchange control restrictions and difficult social political or economic conditions we also must comply with applicable us local and other international anticorruption laws export controls and economic sanctions which can be complex and stringent in all jurisdictions where we operate failure to comply or to implement business practices that sufficiently prevent corruption could result in significant remediation expense and expose us to significant civil and criminal penalties and reputational harm in developing countries or regions we may face further risks such as slower receipt of payments nationalization social and economic instability currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries 

in addition because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the argentine peso australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chilean peso euro indian rupee japanese yen and south african rand fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies including the persistent strength of the us dollar in recent periods may adversely affect our financial results 

 our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation regulation judicial actions or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare our business is also subject to specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products existing and proposed laws and regulations in particular in the european union and the united states concerning user privacy use of personal information and online tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internetbased and digital marketing legislators agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products such as alcohol or tobacco and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients’ goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently on our revenues furthermore we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial 

 we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity our forecasts of the investment’s future performance also factor into the initial consideration when actual financial results differ our returns on the investment could be adversely affected 

we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees businesses assets or systems into our organization including with respect to our internal policies and required controls we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investments operations furthermore it may take longer than 

anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all talent is among our most valuable assets and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel acquisition and integration activity may also divert management’s attention and other corporate resources from other business needs if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

 we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information developing new business opportunities and digital products and processing business transactions the incidence of malicious technologyrelated events such as cyberattacks computer hacking computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide power outages equipment failure natural disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis with a large number of agencies and legal entities and the resulting size diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase our potential vulnerability to such breakdowns malicious intrusions or attacks 

likewise data privacy breaches as well as improper use of social media by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data such as personally identifiable information strategic plans and trade secrets could be exposed to third parties or to the general public we operate worldwide and the legal rules governing data transfers are often complex conflicting unclear or everchanging we also utilize third parties including thirdparty “cloud” computing services to store transfer or process data and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business 

any such breaches or breakdowns could expose us to legal liability be expensive to remedy result in a loss of our or our clients’ or vendors’ proprietary information and damage our reputation efforts to develop implement and maintain security measures are costly may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated 

 we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and fixed assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance 

as of december 31 2015  we have substantial amounts of longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet including approximately 36 billion  of goodwill future events including our financial performance market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies loss of a significant client’s business or strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets as well as our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 from time to time we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them see statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 we maintain a 1 billion committed credit facility to increase our financial flexibility the “credit agreement” if credit under the credit agreement were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity could be adversely affected the credit agreement contains financial covenants and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them for example compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges if we were unable to comply with any of 

the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders and our costs under the credit agreement could increase if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver the credit agreement could be terminated and any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration 

furthermore if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook see “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness including covenants and interest rates we could be adversely affected if our credit ratings were downgraded or if they were significantly weaker than those of our competitors our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

 although as a nonmanufacturing service business we generally are not directly impacted by current laws and regulations with respect to climate change and other sustainability concerns we could incur related costs indirectly through our clients increasingly our clients request that we comply with their own social responsibility sustainability or other business policies or standards which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations before they commence or continue doing business with us our compliance with these policies and related certification requirements could be costly and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business relationships or reputation further if clients’ costs are adversely affected by climate change or related laws and regulations this could negatively impact their spending on our advertising and marketing services we could also face increased prices from our own suppliers that face climate changerelated costs and that seek to pass on their increased costs to their customers

executive summary 

during 2015  our organic revenue increase was driven by growth throughout all our geographic regions which was a result of growth with existing clients and net new business wins during the year the growth in our domestic market was across all major disciplines and nearly all agencies our international organic increase was across all our disciplines with notable contributions from the asia pacific region and the united kingdom we continued to have strong growth in demand for our full range of services including creative digital media and marketing services across most of our regional markets we carefully managed our operating expenses which reflected investments made in our agencies to support our new business portfolio service our existing clients and grow our capabilities 

overall demand for our services by clients remains solid though with challenging economic conditions in some parts of the world marketers continue to show a measure of caution we continue to derive substantial benefit from our diversified client base our global footprint and the broad range and strength of our professional offerings we continued to enhance our businesses during 2015 by making investments in creative and strategic talent that emphasize our growth priorities fastgrowth digital marketing channels highgrowth geographic regions creative talent and strategic world markets we believe our continued investment in tools technology and process improvements will create efficiencies in the delivery of our services

the following tables present a summary of financial performance for the year ended december 31 2015  as compared with the same periods in 2014  and 2013  



when we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the remainder we call organic change which indicates how our underlying business performed the performance metrics that we use to evaluate our results include the organic change in revenue salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses and the components of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue additionally in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by geographic region and also by business sector in which we focus on our top 100 clients which typically constitute approximately 55 to 60 of our annual consolidated revenues 

the change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the priorperiod reported results using the currentperiod exchange rates and comparing these priorperiod adjusted amounts to the priorperiod reported results although the us dollar is our reporting currency a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies therefore our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar affect our consolidated results of operations and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact on us related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2015  included the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling and euro 

for purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred during the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan for 2015  and 2014  the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue and operating expenses compared to the prioryear period see note 4  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions

revenue 

our revenue is directly impacted by the retention and spending levels of existing clients and by our ability to win new clients most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter in the events marketing business revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete when we act as principal for these projects we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs are incurred as passthrough costs in office and general expenses 



during 2015  our revenue increased by 767  or 10  compared to 2014  comprised of an organic revenue increase of 4615  or 61  and the effect of net acquisitions of 237  largely offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 4085  our organic revenue increase was throughout all geographic regions attributable to a combination of net client wins and higher spending in most client sectors notably in the technology and telecom and healthcare sectors the organic increase in our domestic market was driven by growth across most disciplines most notably at our advertising and media businesses our digital specialist agencies and our public relations agencies in our international markets the organic revenue increase was driven by growth across all disciplines most notably at our advertising business in the asia pacific region predominantly in china india and singapore and in the united kingdom also contributing to our international organic revenue increase were our digital specialist agencies and public relations businesses across all regions 



during 2014  our revenue increased by 4148  or 58  compared to 2013  comprised of an organic revenue increase of 3950  or 55  and the effect of net acquisitions of 953  partially offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 755  our organic revenue increase was throughout nearly all geographic regions attributable to net client wins and net higher spending from existing clients most notably in the healthcare and auto and transportation sectors partially offset by modest declines in the technology and telecom and consumer goods sectors the organic increase in our domestic market was driven by growth across most disciplines most notably at our advertising and media businesses and at our digital specialist agencies partially offset by a decline at our events marketing business the international organic revenue increase was driven by growth across all disciplines and nearly all geographic regions most notably in the asia pacific region led by australia china and singapore in the united kingdom in the latin america region led by brazil and argentina and in the other regions primarily in the middle

east partially offset by an organic decrease in the continental europe region due to a continued challenging economic climate since the global recession the economic recovery in continental europe taken as a group has been subdued and as a result has lagged behind most other mature economies relatively high unemployment and very low inflation has led to lower than expected gross domestic product resulting in a challenging economic climate we expect economic and business conditions in this region to improve at a slow to moderate pace in 2015 and 2016

operating expenses 



in 2015  compared to our revenue change of 10  from 2014  total operating expenses decreased 01  resulting in operating margin expansion to 115  from 105  in 2014  compared to our revenue increase of 58  from 2013  total operating expenses increased 34  resulting in operating margin expansion to 105  from 84  our operating profit grew 106  in 2015  to 8719  and grew 318  in 2014  to 7884  operating profit in 2013  included 606  of restructuring and other reorganizationrelated charges 

salaries and related expenses 

salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs employee performance incentives including annual bonus and longterm incentive awards costs for temporary workers severance and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with shortterm changes in revenue levels however salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of the hiring of personnel to support revenue growth and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards additionally we may take severance actions in areas where we have or anticipate decreases in operating performance or to enhance our teams or leadership changes in our incentive awards mix can impact futureperiod expense as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year in which they are earned and longterm incentive awards are expensed over the performance period generally three years factors impacting longterm incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting the change in our stock price actual results and changes to our projected results which could impact the achievement of certain performance targets 



 salaries and related expenses in 2015  increased by 373  compared to 2014  comprised of an organic increase of 2703  and the effect of net acquisitions of 171  largely offset by a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 2501  the organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in base salaries benefits and temporary help of 2387 primarily due to increases in our workforce at businesses where we had revenue growth or new business wins most notably in the domestic market and in the asia pacific region also contributing to the organic increase was higher incentive awards expense resulting from improved financial performance our staff cost ratio defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue decreased in 2015  to 638  from 640  when compared to the prior year 

 salaries and related expenses in 2014  increased by 2749  compared to 2013  comprised of an organic increase of 2539  and the effect of net acquisitions of 593  partially offset by a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 383  the organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in base salaries benefits and temporary help of 2021 primarily due to increases in our workforce at businesses where we had revenue growth or new business wins primarily in the domestic market and in the united kingdom and asia pacific region also contributing to the organic increase was higher incentive awards expense and

office and general expenses in 2015  decreased by 431  compared to 2014  due to a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 1017  partially offset by an organic increase of 554  and the effect of net acquisitions of 32  the organic increase was due to increased general expenses and spending to support new and existing business activity the organic increase was also attributable to an increase in reserves for certain contingencies as well as an increase in professional fees partially offset by lower production expenses related to passthrough costs which are also reflected in revenue for certain projects in which we acted as principal that decreased in size or did not recur during 2015 our office and general expense ratio defined as office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue decreased in 2015  to 248  from 256  in 2014

net interest expense 

for 2015  net interest expense increased by 55  as compared to 2014  primarily due to lower interest income in the current year cash interest expense decreased primarily due to the retirement of our 625  senior unsecured notes due 2014  the  625  notes in the second quarter of 2014 partially offset by the issuance of our 420  senior notes due 2024  the  420  notes in the second quarter of 2014 noncash interest expense increased primarily due to revaluations of mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests within our ian segment 

for 2014  net interest expense decreased by 405  as compared to 2013  primarily due to lower borrowing costs in the current year cash interest expense decreased primarily due to the redemption of our 625 notes in the second quarter of 2014 and redemption of our 1000 senior unsecured notes due 2017 the 1000 notes in the third quarter of 2013 partially offset by the issuance of our 420 notes in the second quarter of 2014 noncash interest expense decreased as compared to 2013 primarily due to the writeoff of unamortized debt issuance costs during 2013 as part of the amendment of our credit agreement as well as the redemption of the 625 notes and 1000 notes

income taxes 



our tax rates are affected by many factors including our worldwide earnings from various countries changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income in 2015  our effective income tax rate of 371  was negatively impacted primarily by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances and from the losses on sales of businesses for which we did not receive a full tax benefit the negative impacts were partially offset by the reversal of valuation allowances in continental europe and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the settlement of the 2010 us federal income tax audit 

in 2014  our effective income tax rate of 300  was positively impacted from changes to our valuations allowances of 660 the primary drivers of the net change were associated with a valuation allowance reversal of 1248 in one jurisdiction partially offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance of 572 in another jurisdiction both in continental europe in addition our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances 

in 2013  our effective income tax rate of 387  was positively impacted by the recognition of losses attributable to worthless securities in a consolidated subsidiary and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the settlement of the 20022006 new york state audit cycle our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted primarily by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

operating income increased during 2015  when compared to 2014  due to an increase in revenue of 81  and a decrease in office and general expenses of 225  partially offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses of 277  the decrease in office and general expenses was primarily due to lower production expenses related to passthrough costs which are also reflected in revenue for certain projects in which we acted as principal that decreased in size or did not recur during the current year the increase in salaries and related expenses was due to increases in our workforce most notably at our public relations business to support business growth and increases due to acquisitions 

operating income increased during 2014  when compared to 2013  due to an increase in revenue of 1113  partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of 696  and office and general expenses of 180  the increase in salaries and related expenses was due to an increase in base salaries benefits and temporary help primarily attributable to increases in our workforce most notably at our public relations business to support business growth as well as increases due to acquisitions in 2014 office and general expenses increased primarily due to higher occupancy costs increased spending to support new business activity and increases due to acquisitions during 2014 

corporate and other 

certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line item within total segment operating income and include corporate office expenses as well as shared service center and certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions salaries and related expenses include salaries longterm incentives annual bonuses and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees office and general expenses primarily include professional fees related to internal control compliance financial statement audits and legal information technology and other consulting services that are engaged and managed through the corporate office office and general expenses also include rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees a portion of centrally managed expenses are allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the planned revenues of each of the operating units amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technologyrelated projects which are allocated based on utilization 

corporate and other expenses decreased during 2015  by 77  to 1418  compared to 2014  primarily due to lower temporary help corporate and other expenses increased during 2014  by 87  to 1495  compared to 2013  primarily due to higher incentive awards expense resulting from improved financial performance and higher employee insurance costs due to increased claims and regulatory changes partially offset by lower occupancy costs 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow overview 

the following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity capital resources and uses of capital 





   

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2015  was 6740  which was an improvement of 45  as compared to 2014  primarily as a result of an improvement in working capital usage of 136  due to the seasonality of our business we typically generate cash from working capital in the second half of a year and use cash from working capital in the first half of a year with the largest impacts in the first and fourth quarters our net working capital usage in 2015  was primarily attributable to our media businesses 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2014  was 6695  which was an improvement of 766  as compared to 2013  primarily as a result of an increase in net income offset by an increase in working capital usage of 1215  our net working capital usage in 2014 was impacted by our media businesses 

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers 

our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments for example while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during 2015  primarily related to payments for capital expenditures of 1611  largely attributable to purchases of leasehold improvements and computer hardware 

net cash used in investing activities during 2014  primarily related to payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions capital expenditures of 1487  related primarily to computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements we made payments of 678  related to acquisitions completed during 2014  net of cash acquired 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during 2015  primarily related to the repurchase of our common stock and payment of dividends we repurchased 136  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 2852  including fees and made dividend payments of 1955  on our common stock 

net cash used in financing activities during 2014  primarily related to the purchase of longterm debt the repurchase of our common stock and payment of dividends we redeemed all 3500  in aggregate principal amount of our 625  notes repurchased 149  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 2751  including fees and made dividend payments of 1590  on our common stock this was offset by the issuance of 5000  in aggregate principal amount of our 420  notes 

foreign exchange rate changes 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a decrease of 1561  in 2015  the decrease was primarily a result of the us dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies including the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar euro and south african rand as of december 31 2015  compared to december 31 2014  

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a decrease of 1010  in 2014  the decrease was primarily a result of the us dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies including the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar and euro as of december 31 2014  compared to december 31 2013  



liquidity outlook 

we expect our cash flow from operations cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months we also have a committed corporate credit facility as well as uncommitted facilities available to support our operating needs we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity with flexibility over significant uses of cash including our capital expenditures cash used for new acquisitions our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

from time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional funds or otherwise improve our liquidity profile enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors which include those specific to us such as our credit rating and those related to the financial markets such as the amount or terms of available credit there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

funding requirements 

our most significant funding requirements include our operations noncancelable operating lease obligations capital expenditures acquisitions common stock dividends taxes debt service and contributions to pension and postretirement plans additionally we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests 

notable funding requirements include 

 

the following summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations and commitments as of december 31 2015  and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 





 

share repurchase program 

in february 2015 our board authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to 3000 excluding fees of our common stock the 2015 share repurchase program which was in addition to the remaining amount 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

available to be repurchased from the 3000 authorization made by the board in february 2014 the 2014 share repurchase program we fully utilized the 2014 share repurchase program during the third quarter of 2015 as of december 31 2015  1586  remained available for repurchase under the 2015 share repurchase program 

on february 12 2016  we announced that our board had approved a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to 3000  excluding fees of our common stock the new authorization is in addition to any amounts remaining for repurchase under the 2015 share repurchase program there is no expiration date associated with the share repurchase programs 

we may effect such repurchases through open market purchases trading plans established in accordance with sec rules derivative transactions or other means we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in future periods although the timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements 

financing and sources of funds 

substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries below is a summary of our sources of liquidity 





  

 

at december 31 2015  we held 6775  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in foreign subsidiaries we have not provided us federal income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we consider such earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states if in the future we distribute these amounts to the united states an additional provision for the us income and foreign withholding taxes net of foreign tax credits could be necessary 

credit agreements 

we maintain a committed corporate credit facility to increase our financial flexibility which has been amended and restated from time to time the credit agreement the credit agreement is a revolving facility expiring in october 2020 under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 10000  or the equivalent in other currencies the company has the ability to increase the commitments under the credit agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to 2500  provided the company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of 2000  or the equivalent in other currencies we use our credit agreement to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries our obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

under the credit agreement we can elect to receive advances bearing interest based on either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate each as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin that is determined based on our credit ratings as of december 31 2015  the applicable margin was 030  for base rate advances and 130  for eurocurrency rate advances letter of credit fees accrue on the average daily aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at a rate equal to the applicable margin for eurocurrency rate advances and fronting fees accrue on the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at an annual rate of 025  we also pay a facility fee at an annual rate that is determined based on our credit ratings which as of december 31 2015  was 020  on the aggregate lending commitment under the credit agreement 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

the table below sets forth the financial covenants in effect as of december 31 2015  





  

 as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with all of our covenants in the credit agreement if we were unable to comply with our covenants in the future we would seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver if we were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver the credit facility could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal in addition under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility 

we also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates as of december 31 2015  there were borrowings under some of the uncommitted facilities to manage working capital needs we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations the weightedaverage interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted credit facilities as of december 31 2015  and 2014  was approximately 3  and 5  respectively 

cash pooling 

we aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the united states we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several ipg agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of bank overdrafts under all of our pooling arrangements and as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the amounts netted were 16083  and 15907  respectively 

debt credit ratings 

our longterm debt credit ratings as of february 16 2016  are listed below 



we are rated investmentgrade by moodys investor services moodys standard and poors and fitch ratings the most recent update to our credit ratings occurred in april 2015 when standard  poors changed our longterm credit rating from bb to bbb a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity either adverse or favorable including among other things because they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise for example our credit agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1  to the consolidated financial statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our consolidated financial statements management has discussed with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies in arranging for such services it is possible that we will enter into global regional and local agreements agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements 

revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the price is fixed or determinable iii collectability is reasonably assured and iv services have been performed depending on the terms of a client contract fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways proportional performance input or output straightline or monthly basis or completed contract 

depending on the terms of the client contract revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed commissions performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to either qualitative or quantitative goals or both performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client the classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments if the judgments change there can be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods 

the majority of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less passthrough expenses charged to a client in most cases the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our consolidated financial statements because of various passthrough expenses such as production and media costs we assess whether our agency or the thirdparty supplier is the primary obligor and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment in addition we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor because we operate broadly as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting accordingly we generally record revenue net of passthrough charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business in those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal primarily sales promotion and event sports and entertainment marketing we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as office and general expenses in general we also report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenueproducing transactions 

as we provide services as part of our core operations we generally incur incidental expenses which in practice are commonly referred to as “outofpocket” expenses these expenses often include expenses related to airfare mileage hotel stays outoftown meals and telecommunication charges we record the reimbursements received for such incidental expenses as revenue with a corresponding offset to office and general expense 

the determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments if we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our reported results if it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin 

we receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that based on the terms of our contracts and local law are either remitted to our clients or retained by us if amounts are to be passed through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or if retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued amended guidance on revenue recognition which requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in july 2015 the fasb affirmed its proposal to delay the effective date of the new standard by one year to january 1 2018 with early adoption to be permitted as of the original effective date of january 1 2017 

the new standard includes a number of changes compared to the current standard the most significant to ipg is the requirement to estimate the amount of variable consideration included in our contracts that will most likely be earned and recognize that consideration over the term of the contract this will likely result in an acceleration in revenue recognition for certain variable contract incentives while we are still assessing what impact the adoption of the amended guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements we expect that the primary impact of the change will be in the timing of revenue recognition within the quarters of a fiscal year we have not yet determined the date or method of transition that we will select 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes us federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 

we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets which is primarily dependent on future earnings a valuation allowance shall be recognized when based on available evidence it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the factors used in assessing valuation allowances include all available evidence such as past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in circumstances where there is negative evidence establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance conversely a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance further in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings 

the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally guidance is provided for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments we evaluate our tax positions using the “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of october 1 st  each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we have 12  reporting units that were subject to the 2015  annual impairment testing our annual impairment review as of october 1 2015 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units 

in performing our annual impairment review we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings financial performance and other relevant entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or clients as well as pending litigation if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the entity is required to determine 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

the fair value and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value otherwise no additional testing is required 

for reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value the first step of the quantitative impairment test is performed for our annual impairment test we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units equity to the carrying value of their net assets the first step is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill the sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the first step of the quantitative impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value excluding goodwill impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

for our 2015  and 2014  annual impairment tests we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for ten and nine reporting units and performed the first step of a twostep quantitative impairment test for two and four reporting units respectively for the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances including financial performance macroeconomic conditions and entityspecific factors such as client wins and losses based on this assessment we have concluded that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value therefore no additional testing was required 

the 2015  and 2014  fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data we generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our analysis for the income approach we used projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth profit margins terminal value growth rates capital expenditures projections assumed tax rates discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management for the market approach we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparablecompany market multiples 

these estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit the discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit for the 2015  test the discount rate we used for our reporting units tested was 110  and the terminal value growth rate for both reporting units tested was 30  the terminal value growth rate represents the expected longterm growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides and the global economy for the 2015  test the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 40  and 60  factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit we believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period actual results of operations cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation and it is possible that differences and changes could be material a deterioration in profitability adverse market conditions significant client losses changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future 

we also perform a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit where the low end of the range reduces growth rates by 025 and increases discount rates by 05 and the high end of the range increases growth rates by 025 and decreases discount rates by 05 we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the quantitative impairment test 

the table below displays the goodwill midpoint of the range for each reporting unit tested in the 2015  and 2014  annual impairment tests our results of the comparison between carrying value and fair value at the average fair value indicated that for the 2015  and 2014  test there were no reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 



additionally we performed a sensitivity analysis and reviewed the carrying values compared to the high end and low end of the valuation range the table below displays the range of the sensitivity analysis for each reporting unit tested in the 2015  and 2014  annual impairment tests for both the 2015  and 2014  tests using the low end of the valuation range there were no reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20 



based on the analysis described above for the reporting units for which we performed the first step of the quantitative impairment test we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of october 1 2015 because these reporting units passed the first step of the test as the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values 

we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets these assets are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7  and 15  years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations we determine our discount rates for our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and significant foreign pension plans based on either a bond selectionsettlement approach or bond yield curve approach using the bond selectionsettlement approach we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments using the bond yield curve approach we determine the discount rate by matching the plans cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve both approaches utilize highquality aarated corporate bonds and the plans projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments which is then used to develop a single discount rate in countries where markets for highquality longterm aa corporate bonds are not well developed a portfolio of longterm government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate 

the discount rate used to calculate net pension and postretirement benefit costs is determined at the beginning of each year for the year ended december 31 2015  discount rates of 415  for the domestic pension plan and 400  for the postretirement benefit plan and a weightedaverage discount rate of 341  for the significant foreign pension plans were used to calculate 2015  net pension and postretirement benefit costs a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2015  net pension and postretirement benefit cost by approximately 10  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

the discount rate used to measure our benefit obligations is determined at the end of each year as of december 31 2015  we used discount rates of 480  for the domestic pension plan and 465  for the domestic postretirement benefit plan and a weightedaverage discount rate of 361  for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the december 31 2015  benefit obligation by approximately 240  and 260  respectively 

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions current and expected market conditions risk premiums associated with asset classes and longterm inflation rates we determine both a shortterm and longterm view and then select a longterm rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities 

for 2015  the weightedaverage expected rates of return of 700  and 501  were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively for 2016  we plan to use expected rates of return of 700   and 543 for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held a lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2015  net pension cost by approximately 10

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations the majority of our debt approximately 89  and 91  as of december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively bears interest at fixed rates we do have debt with variable interest rates but a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a 10 change in interest rates is summarized below 



we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates we do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2015  

we had 15097  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2015  that we generally invest in conservative shortterm bank deposits or securities the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements during 2015  and 2014  we had interest income of 228  and 274  respectively based on our 2015  results a 100basispoint increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately 150  assuming that all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from yearend 2015  levels 

foreign currency rates 

we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2015  included the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling and euro based on 2015  exchange rates and operating results if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10 we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4  assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2015  levels 

the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency mitigating transaction risk however certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes 

we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency the us dollar and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary 

credit and market risks 

balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients we invest our cash primarily in investmentgrade shortterm securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 

our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods

principal markets 

our agencies are located in over 100  countries including every significant world market our geographic revenue breakdown is listed below 



for further information regarding revenues and longlived assets on a geographical basis for each of the last three years see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

sources of revenue 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world our revenues are directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients and our ability to win new clients most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 90 days 

revenues for the creation planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate the difference is the commission that we earn which we either retain in full or share with the client depending on the nature of the applicable services agreement 

we also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion event marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges 

our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work that is typically completed during the fourth quarter fee revenue recognized on a completed contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at december 31 



see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition accounting policies 

clients 

our large and diverse client base includes many of the most recognizable companies and brands throughout the world our holding company structure allows us to maintain a diversified client base across and within a full range of industry sectors in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 20  and 21  of revenue in 2014  and 2013  respectively our largest client accounted for approximately 5  of revenue for 2014  and 2013  based on revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  our five largest clients in alphabetical order were general motors johnson  johnson loréal samsung and unilever we represent several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency brands representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time 

we operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry our operating companies compete against other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships 

personnel 

as of december 31 2014  we employed approximately 47400  people of whom approximately 19200  were employed in the united states because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success we conduct extensive employee training and development throughout our agencies and benchmark our compensation programs against those of our industry for their competitiveness and effectiveness in recruitment and retention there is keen competition for qualified employees

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition see also statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and other providers of creative marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants 

the client’s perception of the quality of our agencies’ creative work and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services may also be an important competitive consideration on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time and clients may choose to terminate their contracts on a relatively short time frame we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 20  of revenue in 2014  a substantial decline in a large client’s advertising and marketing spending or the loss of a significant part of its business could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 

our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

 economic conditions continue to vary across geographic regions and areas of uncertainty about the prospects for continued improvements in the global economy or economic conditions in certain regions and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general in the past some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses this pattern may recur in the future furthermore unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations 

 our employees including creative digital research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most valuable assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and other factors which may be beyond our control in addition the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 from time to time we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them see statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 we maintain a 1 billion committed credit facility to increase our financial flexibility the “credit agreement” if credit under the credit agreement were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity could be adversely affected the credit agreement contains financial covenants and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them for example compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders and our costs under the credit agreement could increase if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver the credit agreement could be terminated and any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration furthermore the credit agreement includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions and if any of them were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institution’s commitment the availability of credit under that agreement would be correspondingly reduced 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities to the extent possible we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients although if clients are unable to pay for commitments that we have entered into on their behalf there could be an adverse effect on our working capital which would negatively impact our operating cash flow 

furthermore if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook see “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 we are a global business operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues approximately 44  in 2014  these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation currency variation exchange control restrictions and difficult political or economic conditions we also must comply with applicable us local and other international anticorruption laws which can be complex and stringent in all jurisdictions where we operate in developing countries or regions we may face further risks such as slower receipt of payments nationalization social and economic instability currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries 

in addition because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the argentine peso australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chilean peso euro indian rupee japanese yen and south african rand fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results concerns persist in europe in particular over the debt burdens of certain countries that use the euro as their currency and the overall stability of the euro possible consequences such as the reintroduction of individual currencies in countries currently employing the euro the dissolution of the euro as a common currency or market perceptions and uncertainties about the possibility and impact of such events could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and results of operations 

 we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and writeoffs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients and if these effects were severe the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity for a description of our client base see “clients” in item 1 business  

 our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation regulation judicial actions or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare our business is also subject to specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products existing and proposed laws and regulations in particular in the european union and the united states concerning user privacy use of personal information and online tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internetbased and digital marketing legislators agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products such as alcohol or tobacco and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients’ goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently on our revenues furthermore we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial 

 we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity our forecasts of the investment’s future performance also factor into the initial consideration when actual financial results differ our returns on the investment could be adversely affected 

we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees businesses assets or systems into our organization including with respect to our internal policies and required controls we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investments operations furthermore it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all talent is among our most valuable assets and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel acquisition and integration activity may also divert management’s attention and other corporate resources from other business needs if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or 

acquisition or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

 we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information developing new business opportunities and processing business transactions we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis with a large number of agencies and legal entities and the resulting size diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase the potential vulnerability of our systems to breakdown malicious intrusion or random attack likewise data privacy breaches as well as improper use of social media by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data could be exposed to third parties or to the general public any such breakdowns or breaches in our systems or dataprotection policies could adversely affect our reputation or business   

 we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and fixed assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance 

as of december 31 2014  we have substantial amounts of longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet including approximately 37 billion  of goodwill future events including our financial performance market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies loss of a significant client’s business or strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets and our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness including covenants and interest rates we could be adversely affected if our credit ratings are downgraded or if they are significantly weaker than those of our competitors our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity

executive summary 

during 2014  our organic revenue increase was driven by growth throughout nearly all our regions which was a result of net new business wins during the year and growth with existing clients the growth in our domestic market was across all major disciplines and nearly all agencies our international organic increase was across all our marketing disciplines with notable contributions from the asia pacific united kingdom and latin america regions the challenging economic climate in the continental europe region continued to impact our international growth we continued to have strong growth in demand for our digital media and marketing services across most of our regional markets we carefully managed our increase in operating expenses which reflected investments made in our agencies to support our new business portfolio and growing disciplines as well as to service our existing clients 

overall demand for our services by clients remains solid though with challenging economic conditions in some parts of the world marketers continue to show a measure of caution we continue to derive substantial benefit from our diversified client base our global footprint and the broad range and strength of our professional offerings we continued to enhance our businesses during 2014 by making investments in creative and strategic talent that emphasize our growth priorities fastgrowth digital marketing channels highgrowth geographic regions and strategic world markets we believe our continued investment in tools technology and process improvements will create efficiencies in the delivery of our services

the following tables present a summary of financial performance for the year ended december 31 2014  as compared with the same periods in 2013  and 2012  



when we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the remainder we call organic change which indicates how our underlying business performed the performance metrics that we use to evaluate our results include the organic change in revenue salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses and the components of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue additionally in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by business sector where we focus on our top 100 clients which typically constitutes approximately 55 to 60 of our annual consolidated revenues we also analyze revenue by geographic region 

the change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the priorperiod reported results using the currentperiod exchange rates and comparing these priorperiod adjusted amounts to the priorperiod reported results although the us dollar is our reporting currency a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies therefore our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this translation risk our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar affect our consolidated results of operations and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact on us related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2014  included the argentine peso australian dollar brazilian real and british pound sterling during 2014  the us dollar was stronger relative to several foreign currencies in regions where we conduct our business as compared to the prioryear period which had a negative impact on our 2014  consolidated results of operations for 2014  and 2013  foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net decreases of approximately 1 in revenues and operating expenses which had a negative impact on our operating margin percentage 

for purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred during the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan for 2014  and 2013  the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue and operating expenses compared to the prioryear period see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions

revenue 

our revenue is directly impacted by our ability to win new clients and the retention and spending levels of existing clients most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter in the events marketing business revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete we generally act as principal for these projects and accordingly record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as passthrough costs in office and general expenses   



during 2014  our revenue increased by 4148  or 58  compared to 2013  comprised of an organic revenue increase of 3950  or 55  and the effect of net acquisitions of 953  partially offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 755     our organic revenue increase was throughout nearly all geographic regions attributable to net client wins and net higher spending from existing clients most notably in the health care and auto and transportation sectors partially offset by modest declines in the technology and telecom and consumer goods sectors the organic increase in our domestic market was driven by growth across most disciplines most notably at our advertising and media businesses and at our digital specialist agencies partially offset by a decline at our events marketing business in our international market the organic revenue increase was primarily in the asia pacific region led by australia china and singapore in the united kingdom in the latin america region led by brazil and argentina and in the other regions primarily in the middle east partially offset by an organic decrease in the continental europe region due to a continued challenging economic climate the international organic revenue increase was driven by growth across all disciplines 



during 2013  our revenue increased by 1661  or 24  compared to 2012  comprised of an organic revenue increase of 1962  or 28  and the effect of net acquisitions of 503  partially offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 804  we had growth in the domestic market with our organic revenue increase primarily attributable to net client wins most notably in the auto and transportation sector and net higher spending from existing clients primarily in the healthcare sector partially offset by decreases in the technology and telecom sector in addition our organic revenue increase in the domestic market was mainly driven by our events marketing and public relations businesses in our international market the organic revenue increase was primarily in the asia pacific region led by australia and china and in the latin america region primarily in brazil also 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

contributing to our international organic revenue increase was net higher spending from existing clients throughout nearly all client sectors most notably in the technology and telecom and healthcare sectors the international organic revenue increase was partially offset by a decline in the continental europe region across most countries in the market due to a continued challenging economic climate

operating expenses 



salaries and related expenses 

salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs employee performance incentives including annual bonus and longterm incentive awards costs for temporary workers severance and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with shortterm changes in revenue levels however salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of the hiring of personnel to support revenue growth and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards additionally we may take severance actions in areas where we have or anticipate decreases in operating performance or to enhance our teams or leadership changes in our incentive awards mix can impact futureperiod expense as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year in which they are earned and longterm incentive awards are expensed over the performance period generally three years factors impacting longterm incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting the change in our stock price actual results and changes to our projected results which could impact the achievement of certain performance targets 



our staff cost ratio defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue increased in 2014  to 640  from 638  in 2013  salaries and related expenses in 2014  increased by 2749  compared to 2013  comprised of an organic increase of 2539  and the effect of net acquisitions of 593  partially offset by a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 383  the organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in base salaries benefits and temporary help of 2021 primarily due to increases in our workforce at businesses where we had revenue growth or new business wins primarily in the domestic market and in the united kingdom and asia pacific region also contributing to the organic increase was higher incentive awards expense and certain agencyrelated bonus accruals resulting from improved financial performance partially offset by lower severance expense 

our staff cost ratio increased in 2013  to 638  from 631  in 2012  salaries and related expenses in 2013  increased by 1536  compared to 2012  comprised of an organic increase of 1657  and the effect of net acquisitions of 282  partially offset by a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 403  the organic increase was primarily due to an increase in base salaries benefits and temporary help of 1501 primarily due to increases in our workforce in international markets predominantly in the asia pacific and latin america regions as well as in our domestic market at businesses where we had revenue growth or new business wins and to a lesser extent modest wage increases

our office and general expense ratio decreased in 2013  to 269  from 271  in 2012  office and general expenses in 2013  increased by 307  compared to 2012  due to an organic increase of 478  and the effect of net acquisitions of 102  partially offset by a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 273  the organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in occupancy costs and higher production expenses in our domestic market related to passthrough costs which are also reflected in revenue partially offset by certain adjustments to contingent acquisition obligations

corporate and other expenses increased during 2014  by 87  to 1495  compared to 2013  primarily due to higher incentive awards expense resulting from improved financial performance and higher employee insurance costs due to increased claims and regulatory changes partially offset by lower occupancy costs 

corporate and other expenses increased slightly during 2013  by 35  to 1408  compared to 2012  primarily due to an increase in salaries and related expenses mainly attributable to higher base salaries benefits and temporary help partially offset by lower severance expenses and a decrease in office and general expenses

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow overview 

the following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity capital resources and uses of capital 





 

   

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2014  was 6695  which was an improvement of 766  as compared to 2013  primarily as a result of an increase in net income offset by an increase in working capital usage of 1215  due to the seasonality of our business we typically generate cash from working capital in the second half of a year and use cash from working capital in the first half of a year with the largest impacts in the first and fourth quarters our net working capital usage in 2014  was impacted by our media businesses 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2013  was 5929  which was an increase of 2357  as compared to 2012 primarily as a result of an improvement in working capital usage of 2836  offset by a decrease in net income the improvement in working capital in 2013  was impacted by our media businesses and an ongoing focus on working capital management at our agencies 

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers 

our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments for example while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during 2014  primarily related to payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions capital expenditures of 1487  related primarily to computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements we made payments of 678  related to acquisitions completed during 2014  net of cash acquired 

net cash used in investing activities during 2013  primarily related to payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions capital expenditures of 1730  related primarily to computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements we made payments of 615  related to acquisitions completed during 2013 net of cash acquired 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during 2014  primarily related to the purchase of longterm debt the repurchase of our common stock and payment of dividends during 2014 we redeemed all 3500  in aggregate principal amount of the 625  notes repurchased 149  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 2751  including fees and made dividend payments of 1590  on our common stock this was offset by the issuance of 5000  in aggregate principal amount of our 420  notes 

net cash used in financing activities during 2013 primarily related to the purchase of longterm debt the repurchase of our common stock and payment of dividends we redeemed all 6000 in aggregate principal amount of our 1000  notes in addition 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

we repurchased 318  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 4818  including fees and made dividend payments of 1260  on our common stock 

foreign exchange rate changes 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a decrease of 1010  in 2014  the decrease was primarily a result of the us dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies including the canadian dollar brazilian real australian dollar and the euro as of december 31 2014  compared to december 31 2013  

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a decrease of 941  in 2013  the decrease was primarily a result of the us dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies including the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar japanese yen and south african rand as of december 31 2013  compared to december 31 2012  



liquidity outlook 

we expect our cash flow from operations cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months we also have a committed corporate credit facility as well as uncommitted facilities available to support our operating needs we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity with flexibility over significant uses of cash including our capital expenditures cash used for new acquisitions our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends 

from time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional funds or otherwise improve our liquidity profile enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors which include those specific to us such as our credit rating and those related to the financial markets such as the amount or terms of available credit there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

funding requirements 

our most significant funding requirements include our operations noncancelable operating lease obligations capital expenditures acquisitions common stock dividends taxes debt service restructuring and contributions to pension and postretirement plans additionally we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests 

notable funding requirements include

the following summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations and commitments as of december 31 2014  and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 





 

 

 

 

share repurchase program 

in february 2013 our board authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to 3000  excluding fees of our common stock the 2013 share repurchase program in march 2013 the board authorized an increase in the amount available under our 2013 share repurchase program up to 5000  excluding fees of our common stock to be used towards the repurchase of shares resulting from the conversion to common stock of the 475 notes we fully utilized the 2013 share repurchase program as of the third quarter of 2014 in february 2014 the board authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to 3000 excluding fees of our common stock the 2014 share repurchase program as of december 31 2014  1436  remained available for repurchase under the 2014 share repurchase program 

on february 13 2015 we announced that our board had approved a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to 3000  excluding fees of our common stock the new authorization is in addition to any amounts remaining available for repurchase under the 2014 share repurchase program 

we may effect such repurchases through open market purchases trading plans established in accordance with sec rules derivative transactions or other means we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in future periods although the 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements there is no expiration date associated with the share repurchase programs 

financing and sources of funds 

substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries below is a summary of our sources of liquidity 





  

 

at december 31 2014  we held 8965  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in foreign subsidiaries we have not provided us federal income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we consider such earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states if in the future we distribute these amounts to the united states an additional provision for the us income and foreign withholding taxes net of foreign tax credits could be necessary 

credit agreements 

we maintain a committed corporate credit facility to increase our financial flexibility the credit agreement the credit agreement is a revolving facility expiring in december 2018 under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 10000  or the equivalent in other currencies the company continues to have the ability to increase the commitments under the credit agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to 2500  provided the company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of 2000  or the equivalent in other currencies we use our credit agreement to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries our obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

under the credit agreement we can elect to receive advances bearing interest based on either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate each as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin that is determined based on our credit ratings as of december 31 2014 the applicable margin is 0275  for base rate advances and 1275  for eurocurrency rate advances letter of credit fees accrue on the average daily aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at a rate equal to the applicable margin for eurocurrency rate advances and fronting fees accrue on the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at an annual rate of 0250  we also pay a facility fee at an annual rate of 0225  on the aggregate lending commitment under the credit agreement 

the table below sets forth the financial covenants in effect as of december 31 2014  





  

 as of december 31 2014  we were in compliance with all of our covenants in the credit agreement if we were unable to comply with our covenants in the future we would seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver if we were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver the credit facility could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal in addition under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

we also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates as of december 31 2014  there were borrowings under some of the uncommitted facilities to manage working capital needs we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations the weightedaverage interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted credit facilities as of december 31 2014  and 2013  was approximately 45  

cash pooling 

we aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the united states we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several ipg agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of bank overdrafts under all of our pooling arrangements and as of december 31 2014  and 2013  the amounts netted were 15907  and 14153  respectively 

debt credit ratings 

our longterm debt credit ratings as of february 13 2015  are listed below 



we are rated investmentgrade by both moodys investor services moodys and fitch ratings the most recent update to our credit ratings occurred in february 2013 when standard  poors changed our outlook from positive to stable a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity either adverse or favorable including among other things because they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise for example our credit agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our consolidated financial statements management has discussed with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies in arranging for such services it is possible that we will enter into global regional and local agreements agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements 

revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the price is fixed or determinable iii collectability is reasonably assured and iv services have been performed 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

depending on the terms of a client contract fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways proportional performance input or output straightline or monthly basis or completed contract 

depending on the terms of the client contract revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed commissions performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to either qualitative or quantitative goals or both performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client the classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments if the judgments change there can be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods 

the majority of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less passthrough expenses charged to a client in most cases the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our consolidated financial statements because of various passthrough expenses such as production and media costs we assess whether our agency or the thirdparty supplier is the primary obligor and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment in addition we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor because we operate broadly as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting accordingly we generally record revenue net of passthrough charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business in those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal primarily sales promotion and event sports and entertainment marketing we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as office and general expenses in general we also report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenueproducing transactions 

as we provide services as part of our core operations we generally incur incidental expenses which in practice are commonly referred to as “outofpocket” expenses these expenses often include expenses related to airfare mileage hotel stays outoftown meals and telecommunication charges we record the reimbursements received for such incidental expenses as revenue with a corresponding offset to office and general expense 

the determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments if we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our reported results if it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin 

we receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that based on the terms of our contracts and local law are either remitted to our clients or retained by us if amounts are to be passed through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or if retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes us federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 

we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets which is primarily dependent on future earnings a valuation allowance shall be recognized when based on available evidence it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the factors used in assessing valuation allowances include all available evidence such as past operating results estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies in circumstances where there is negative evidence establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance conversely a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance further in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally guidance is provided for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments we evaluate our tax positions using the “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of october 1 st  each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we have 13  reporting units that were subject to the 2014  annual impairment testing our annual impairment review as of october 1 2014 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units 

during 2012 we adopted new authoritative guidance for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets respectively which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings financial performance and other relevant entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or clients as well as pending litigation if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the entity is required to determine the fair value and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value otherwise no additional testing is required 

for reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value the first step of the quantitative impairment test is performed for our annual impairment test we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units equity to the carrying value of their net assets the first step is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill the sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the first step of the quantitative impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value excluding goodwill impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

for our 2014  and 2013  annual impairment tests we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for nine and six reporting units and performed the first step of a twostep quantitative impairment test for four and seven reporting units respectively for the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances including financial performance macroeconomic conditions and entityspecific factors such as client wins and losses based on this assessment we have concluded that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value therefore no additional testing was required 

the 2014  and 2013  fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data we generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approaches for our analysis for the income approach we used projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth profit margins terminal value growth rates capital expenditures projections assumed tax rates discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management for the market approach we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparablecompany market multiples 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

these estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit the discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit for the 2014  test the discount rates we used for our reporting units tested were between 115  and 120  and the terminal value growth rate for all four of our reporting units tested was 30  the terminal value growth rate represents the expected longterm growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides and the global economy for the 2014  test the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 30  and 60  factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit we believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period actual results of operations cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation and it is possible that differences and changes could be material a deterioration in profitability adverse market conditions significant client losses changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future 

we also perform a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit where the low end of the range reduces growth rates by 025 and increases discount rates by 05 and the high end of the range increases growth rates by 025 and decreases discount rates by 05 we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the quantitative impairment test 

the table below displays the goodwill midpoint of the range for each reporting unit tested in the 2014  and 2013  annual impairment tests our results of the comparison between carrying value and fair value at the average fair value indicated that for the 2014  test there were no reporting units and for the 2013  test there was one reporting unit whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20 



additionally we performed a sensitivity analysis and reviewed the carrying values compared to the high end and low end of the valuation range the table below displays the range of the sensitivity analysis for each reporting unit tested in the 2014  and 2013  annual impairment tests for the 2014  test using the low end of the valuation range there were no reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20 for the 2013  test using the low end of the valuation range there were two reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20 but not less than 0 



management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

  based on the analysis described above for the reporting units for which we performed the first step of the quantitative impairment test we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of october 1 2014 because these reporting units passed the first step of the test as the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values 

we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets these assets are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7  and 15  years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations we determine our discount rates for our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and significant foreign pension plans based on either a bond selectionsettlement approach or bond yield curve approach using the bond selectionsettlement approach we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments using the bond yield curve approach we determine the discount rate by matching the plans cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve both approaches utilize highquality aarated corporate bonds and the plans projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments which is then used to develop a single discount rate in countries where markets for highquality longterm aa corporate bonds are not well developed a portfolio of longterm government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate 

the discount rate used to calculate net pension and postretirement benefit costs is determined at the beginning of each year for the year ended december 31 2014  a discount rate of 485  was used for the domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and a weightedaverage discount rate of 429  for the significant foreign pension plans to calculate 2014  net pension and postretirement benefit costs a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2014  net pension and postretirement benefit cost by approximately 10  

the discount rate used to measure our benefit obligations is determined at the end of each year as of december 31 2014  we used a discount rate of 415  for the domestic pension plan and 400  for the domestic postretirement benefit plan and a weightedaverage discount rate of 341  for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the december 31 2014  benefit obligation by approximately 280  and 300  respectively 

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions current and expected market conditions risk premiums associated with asset classes and longterm inflation rates we determine both a shortterm and longterm view and then select a longterm rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities 

for 2014  the weightedaverage expected rates of return of 700  and 618  were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively for 2015  we plan to use expected rates of return of 700   and 501 for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held a lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2014  net pension cost by approximately 10

amounts in millions 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items from time to time we use derivative instruments pursuant to established guidelines and policies to manage some portion of these risks derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rates 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations the majority of our debt approximately 91  and 86  as of december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively bears interest at fixed rates we do have debt with variable interest rates but a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a 10 change in interest rates is summarized below 



we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates we do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2014  

we had 16672  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2014  that we generally invest in conservative shortterm bank deposits or securities the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements during 2014  and 2013  we had interest income of 274  and 247  respectively   based on our 2014  results a 100basispoint increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately 167  assuming that all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from yearend 2014  levels 

foreign currency rates 

we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2014  included the argentine peso australian dollar brazilian real and british pound sterling based on 2014  exchange rates and operating results if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10 we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4  assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2014  levels 

the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency mitigating transaction risk however certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency the us dollar and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary 

credit and market risks 

balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients we invest our cash primarily in investmentgrade shortterm securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 

our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods

principal markets 

our agencies are located in over 100  countries including every significant world market our geographic revenue breakdown is listed below 



for further information regarding revenues and longlived assets on a geographical basis for each of the last three years see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

sources of revenue 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world our revenues are directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients and our ability to win new clients most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 90 days 

revenues for the creation planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate the difference is the commission that we earn which we either retain in full or share with the client depending on the nature of the applicable services agreement 

we also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion event marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges 

our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter fee revenue recognized on a completed contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at december 31 



see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition accounting policies 

clients 

our large and diverse client base includes many of the most recognizable companies and brands throughout the world our holding company structure allows us to maintain a diversified client base across and within a full range of industry sectors in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 21  of revenue in 2013  and 2012  our largest client accounted for approximately 5  of revenue for 2013  and 2012  based on revenue for the year ended december 31 2013  our five largest clients in alphabetical order were general motors johnson  johnson loréal microsoft and unilever we represent several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency brands representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time 

we operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry our operating companies compete against other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships 

personnel 

as of december 31 2013  we employed approximately 45400  people of whom approximately 18400  were employed in the united states because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success we conduct extensive employee training and development throughout our agencies and benchmark our compensation programs against those of our industry for their competitiveness and effectiveness in recruitment and retention there is keen competition for qualified employees

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition see also statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 the advertising and marketing communications business is highly competitive our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and with other providers of creative marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants 

the client’s perception of the quality of our agencies’ creative work and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services may also be important competitive considerations on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time and clients may choose to terminate their contracts on a relatively short timeframe we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 21  of revenue in 2013  a substantial decline in a large client’s advertising and marketing spending or the loss of a significant part of its business could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 

our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

 economic conditions continue to vary across geographic regions and areas of uncertainty about the prospects for continued improvements in the global economy or economic conditions in certain regions and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services the industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy generally in the past some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses this pattern may recur in the future furthermore unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations 

 our employees including creative digital research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most valuable assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and other factors which may be beyond our control in addition the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 from time to time we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them see statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 we maintain a 1 billion committed credit facility to increase our financial flexibility the “credit agreement” if credit under the credit agreement were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity could be adversely affected the credit agreement contains financial covenants and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them for example compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders and our costs under the credit agreement could increase if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver the credit agreement could be terminated and any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration furthermore the credit agreement includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions and if any of them were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institution’s commitment the availability of credit under that agreement would be correspondingly reduced 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities although to the extent possible we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients if clients are unable to pay for commitments we have entered into on their behalf there could be an adverse effect on our working capital which would negatively impact our operating cash flow 

furthermore if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook see “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 we are a global business operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues approximately 44  in 2013  these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation currency variation exchange control restrictions and difficult local political or economic conditions we also must comply with applicable us local and other international anticorruption laws which can be complex and stringent in all jurisdictions where we operate in developing countries or regions we may face further risks such as slower receipt of payments nationalization social and economic instability currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries 

in addition because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the australian dollar brazilian real euro indian rupee japanese yen pound sterling and south african rand fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results concerns persist in europe in particular over the debt burdens of certain countries that use the euro as their currency and the overall stability of the euro possible consequences such as the reintroduction of individual currencies in countries currently employing the euro or the dissolution of the euro as a common currency or market perceptions and uncertainties about the possibility and impact of such events could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and results of operations 

 we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and writeoffs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients and if these effects were severe the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity for a description of our client base see “clients” in item 1 business  

 our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation regulation judicial actions or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare our business is also subject to specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products existing and proposed laws and regulations in particular in the european union and the united states concerning user privacy use of personal information and online tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internetbased and digital marketing legislators agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products such as alcohol or tobacco and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients’ goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently on our revenues furthermore we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial 

 we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase 

payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity our forecasts of the investment’s future performance also factor into the initial consideration when actual financial results differ our returns on the investment could be adversely affected 

we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees businesses assets or systems into our organization including with respect to our internal policies and required controls we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investments operations furthermore it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all talent is among our most valuable assets and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel acquisition and integration activity may also divert management’s attention and other corporate resources from other business needs if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or acquisition or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

 we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information developing new business opportunities and processing business transactions we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis with a large number of agencies and legal entities and the resulting size diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase the potential vulnerability of our systems to breakdown malicious intrusion or random attack likewise data privacy breaches as well as improper use of social media by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data could be exposed to third parties or to the public generally any such breakdowns or breaches in our systems or dataprotection policies could adversely affect our reputation or business   

 we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and fixed assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance 

as of december 31 2013  we have substantial amounts of longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet including approximately 36 billion  of goodwill future events including our financial performance market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies loss of a significant client’s business or strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets and our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized 

 we can be adversely affected if our credit ratings are downgraded or if they are significantly weaker than those of our competitors because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness including covenants and interest rates our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity

executive summary 

during 2013  our organic revenue increase was primarily driven by growth in our domestic market which was a result of net new business with clients won during the year and growth with existing clients our international organic increase was primarily in the asia pacific and latin america regions across our marketing disciplines the continental europe region weighed on our international growth mainly due to a challenging economic climate across most regional markets we continued to have strong growth in demand for our digital media and marketing services increased operating expenses reflected investments made in our agencies to support our new business portfolio and growing disciplines as well as to service our existing clients we incurred expenses for restructuring in order to better align our cost structure with our revenue primarily in continental europe 

with challenging economic conditions in many markets around the world particularly in europe marketers continue to show a degree of caution in their marketing investment we continue to derive substantial benefit from our diversified client base our global footprint and the broad range and strength of our professional offerings we continued to enhance our businesses during 2013 by making investments in creative and strategic talent that emphasize our growth priorities fastgrowth digital marketing channels highgrowth geographic regions and strategic world markets we believe our continued investment in tools technology and process improvements will create efficiencies in the delivery of our services 

we continued to enhance value to our shareholders through common stock dividends share repurchases and improvements in our balance sheet during 2013 average diluted shares decreased by 11  primarily due to share repurchases basic earnings per share available to ipg common stockholders for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were 062  101 and 112 per share respectively diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were 061  094 and 099 per share respectively basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31   2013  included a negative impact of 012  and 011  per share respectively from the effects of restructuring and related costs net of tax basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31   2013  included a negative impact of 006  per share from a loss on early extinguishment of debt net of tax basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2012 included 014 and 012 per share respectively from the gain recorded for the sale of our remaining holdings in facebook net of tax basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2011  included 027 and 023 per share respectively from the gain recorded for the sale of approximately half of our holdings in facebook net of tax

the following tables present a summary of financial performance for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared with the same periods in 2012  and 2011  



when we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the remainder we call organic change which indicates how our underlying business performed the performance metrics that we use to evaluate our results include the organic change in revenue salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses and the components of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue additionally in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by business sector where we focus on our top 100 clients which typically constitutes approximately 55 to 60 of our annual consolidated revenues we also analyze revenue by geographic region 

the change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the priorperiod reported results using the currentperiod exchange rates and comparing these priorperiod adjusted amounts to the priorperiod reported results although the us dollar is our reporting currency a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies therefore our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this translation risk our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar affect our consolidated results of operations and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact on us related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2013  include the australian dollar brazilian real euro japanese yen and the south african rand during 2013  the us dollar was stronger relative to several foreign currencies in regions where we primarily conduct our business as compared to the prioryear period which had a net negative impact on our 2013  consolidated results of operations for 2013  foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net decreases of approximately 1 in revenues and operating expenses which had a minimal impact on our operating margin percentage for 2012  foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net decreases of approximately 2 in revenues and operating expenses which had no net impact on our operating margin percentage 

for purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred during the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan for 2013  and 2012  the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue and operating expenses   compared to the prioryear period see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions

revenue 

our revenue is directly impacted by our ability to win new clients and the retention and spending levels of existing clients most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter in the events marketing business revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete we generally act as principal for these projects and accordingly record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as passthrough costs in office and general expenses   



during 2013  our revenue increased by 1661  or 24  compared to 2012  due to an organic revenue increase of 1962  or 28  and the effect of net acquisitions of 503  partially offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 804  we had growth in the domestic market with our organic revenue increase primarily attributable to net client wins most notably in the auto and transportation sector and net higher spending from existing clients primarily in the healthcare sector partially offset by decreases in the technology and telecom sector in addition our organic revenue increase in the domestic market was mainly driven by our events marketing and public relations businesses in our international market the organic revenue increase was primarily in the asia pacific region led by australia and china and in the latin america region primarily in brazil also contributing to our international organic revenue increase was net higher spending from existing clients throughout nearly all client sectors most notably in the technology and telecom and healthcare sectors the international organic revenue increase was partially offset by a decline in the continental europe region across most countries in the market due to a continued challenging economic climate 



during 2012  our revenue decreased by 584  or 08  compared to 2011  due to an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 1476  partially offset by an organic revenue increase of 474  or 07  and the effect of net acquisitions of 418  our organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to new client wins and net higher spending from existing clients in our international markets we had strong growth in the asia pacific region primarily in australia singapore india and china and in the latin america region predominantly in brazil also contributing to our international organic revenue increase was an

increase in the united kingdom predominately due to our events marketing business which benefited from work performed in connection with the london olympics in the third quarter of 2012 the organic revenue increase in our international markets was throughout nearly all client sectors most notably in the retail and technology and telecom sectors partially offset by a decrease in the consumer goods sector due to net client losses in the prior year our revenue decreased in the continental europe region primarily in spain and italy due to a continued challenging economic climate this was partially offset by growth in germany in our domestic market our organic revenue decrease was due to net client losses in the prior year most notably in the consumer goods and technology and telecom sectors and a decline in spending from existing clients primarily in the retail and health care sectors partially offsetting this decline in the domestic market was an organic revenue increase in the auto and transportation and financial services sectors

operating expenses 



salaries and related expenses 

salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs employee performance incentives including annual bonus and longterm incentive awards costs for temporary workers severance and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with shortterm changes in revenue levels however salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of the hiring of personnel to support revenue growth and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards additionally we may take severance actions in areas where we have or anticipate decreases in operating performance or to enhance our teams or leadership changes in our incentive awards mix can impact futureperiod expense as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year they are earned and longterm incentive awards are expensed over the performance period generally three years factors impacting longterm incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting the change in our stock price actual results and changes to our projected results which could impact the achievement of certain performance targets 



our staff cost ratio defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue increased in 2013  to 638  from 631  in 2012  salaries and related expenses in 2013  increased by 1536  compared to 2012  due to an organic increase of 1657  and the effect of net acquisitions of 282  partially offset by a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 403  the organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in base salaries benefits and temporary help of 1501 primarily due to increases in our workforce in international markets predominantly in the asia pacific and latin america regions as well as in our domestic market at businesses where we had revenue growth or new business wins and to a lesser extent modest wage increases 

our staff cost ratio increased in 2012  to 631  from 628  in 2011  salaries and related expenses in 2012  decreased by 102  compared to 2011  due to a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 856  partially offset by an organic increase of 409  and the effect of net acquisitions of 345  the organic increase was primarily due to an increase in base salaries benefits and temporary help of 964 primarily attributable to increases in our workforce in international regions most notably in the asia pacific and latin america regions and businesses where we had revenue growth as well as modest wage increases our workforce decreased in regions and businesses where we had revenue declines as we were disciplined in managing our workforce

partially offsetting this organic increase was a reduction in incentive award expense of 511 resulting from lower financial performance compared to targets 

the following table details our staff cost ratio 



office and general expenses 

office and general expenses primarily include rent expense professional fees certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and depreciation and amortization costs office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements including production costs outofpocket costs such as travel for client service staff and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients production expenses can vary significantly between periods depending upon the timing of completion of certain projects where we act as principal which could impact trends between various periods in the future 



our office and general expense ratio defined as office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue decreased in 2013  to 269  from 271  in 2012  office and general expenses in 2013  increased by 307  compared to 2012  due to an organic increase of 478  and the effect of net acquisitions of 102  partially offset by a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 273  the organic increase was primarily attributable to an increase in occupancy costs and higher production expenses in our domestic market related to passthrough costs which are also reflected in revenue for certain projects where we acted as principal that increased in size or were new during 2013 partially offset by certain adjustments to contingent acquisition obligations 

our office and general expense ratio decreased in 2012  to 271  from 274  in 2011  office and general expenses in 2012  decreased by 371  compared to 2011  due to a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 407  and an organic decrease of 48  partially offset by the effect of net acquisitions of 84  the organic decrease was primarily attributable to lower occupancy costs as we continue to find efficiencies in our real estate portfolio and professional fees the organic decrease was partially offset by higher production expenses in our international markets most notably in the asia pacific region and in the united kingdom related to passthrough costs which are also reflected in revenue for certain projects where we acted as principal that increased in size or were new during 2012

restructuring and other reorganizationrelated charges reversals net 

the components of the restructuring and other reorganizationrelated charges net for 2013 and prior restructuring plans are listed below 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 we implemented a cost savings initiative the “2013 plan” to better align our cost structure with our revenue primarily in continental europe in connection with this initiative we recorded pretax restructuring charges of 612  comprised of severance and termination costs of 559  lease terminations costs of 48  and other exit costs of 05  all restructuring actions were identified and initiated by the end of 2013 with all actions expected to be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2014 

the following table presents the 2013 plan restructuring and other reorganizationrelated charges net and employee headcount reduction for the year ended december 31 2013 



the 2013 plan includes a planned reduction in workforce of 541 employees across all levels and functions and costs associated with offices that were vacated we expect these initiatives to generate an estimated annual pretax savings of approximately 40 in 2014 

net restructuring and other reorganizationrelated reversals charges related to the 2007 2003 and 2001 restructuring plans for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were 06  12  and 10  respectively 

expenses and other income 



net interest expense 

for 2013  net interest expense decreased by 60  as compared to 2012  primarily due to a decrease in cash interest on debt obligations cash interest expense decreased primarily due to the retirement of our 475  convertible senior notes due 2023  the  475  notes in the first quarter of 2013 and redemption of our 1000  senior unsecured notes due 2017  the  1000  notes in july 2013 which were refinanced with debt issued at lower rates in 2012 noncash interest expense increased primarily as a result of the retirement of our 475  notes and our 425  convertible senior notes due 2023  the  425  notes in the first quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2012 respectively at retirement the premiums associated with these notes which had reduced interest expense in prior periods were fully amortized

for 2012  net interest expense increased by 50  as compared to 2011  primarily due to an increase in noncash interest expense noncash interest expense increased since the premium associated with our 425  notes which we retired in march 2012 which had reduced interest expense in prior periods was fully amortized cash interest expense decreased primarily due to the retirement of our 425 notes which was offset by lower interest income primarily in the united states due to lower cash balances

sales of businesses and investments – during 2013  we recognized gains from the sale of marketable securities in the asia pacific region within our ian segment and the sale of investments in our rabbi trusts which was partially offset by a loss from the sale of a business in the united kingdom within our ian segment during 2012 we recognized gains from the sale of our remaining holdings in facebook and a business in an international market within our cmg segment which were partially offset by losses from the sale of businesses within our ian segment as well as an adjustment relating to a reserve for a change in estimate in connection with a business disposed of in a prior year during 2011 we recognized a gain from the sale of approximately half of our holdings in facebook which was partially offset by a loss relating to the sale of a business in the domestic market within our ian segment 

vendor discounts and credit adjustments – in connection with the liabilities related to vendor discounts and credits established as part of the restatement we presented in our 2004 annual report on form 10k these adjustments reflect the reversal of certain of these liabilities primarily where the statute of limitations has lapsed or as a result of differences resulting from settlements with clients or vendors 

other income expense net  – during 2013  other income expense net primarily included a noncash gain on remeasurement to fair value of an equity interest in an affiliate located in the asia pacific region within our cmg segment upon acquiring a controlling interest 

income taxes 



our tax rates are affected by many factors including our worldwide earnings from various countries changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income in 2013  our effective income tax rate of 387  was positively impacted by the recognition   of losses attributable to worthless securities in a consolidated subsidiary and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the settlement of the 20022006 new york state audit cycle our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted primarily by losses in certain foreign jurisdictions where we receive no tax benefit due to 100  valuation allowances 

in 2012  our effective income tax rate of 316  was positively impacted by the reversals of valuation allowances associated with the asia pacific and continental europe regions of 262  and 218  respectively as well as by a benefit derived from the deduction of foreign tax credits that previously had a full valuation allowance our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by an adjustment of 195  associated with the establishment of a previously unrecorded reserve for a tax contingency for the years 2007 through 2010 losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances and state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefit

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2013  was 5929  which was an increase of 2357  as compared to 2012  primarily as a result of an improvement in working capital usage of 2836  offset by a decrease in net income due to the seasonality of our business we typically generate cash from working capital in the second half of a year and use cash from working capital in the first half of a year with the largest impacts in the first and fourth quarters the improvement in working capital in 2013  was impacted by our media businesses and an ongoing focus on working capital management at our agencies 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2012  was 3572  which was an increase of 837  as compared to 2011 primarily as a result of a decrease in working capital usage of 662  the net working capital usage in 2012  was primarily impacted by our media businesses 

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers 

our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments for example while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year

net cash used in investing activities during 2013  primarily relates to payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions capital expenditures of 1730  relate primarily to computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements we made payments of 615  related to acquisitions completed during 2013  

net cash used in investing activities during 2012  primarily related to payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by the net proceeds of 948  received from the sale of our remaining holdings in facebook capital expenditures of 1692  primarily related to computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements capital expenditures increased in 2012  compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in leasehold improvements made during the year payments for acquisitions of 1455  primarily related to payments for new acquisitions 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during 2013  primarily related to the purchase of longterm debt the repurchase of our common stock and payment of dividends we redeemed all 6000 in aggregate principal amount of our 1000  notes in addition we repurchased 318  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 4818  including fees and made dividend payments of 1260  on our common stock

net cash provided by financing activities during 2012  primarily reflected net proceeds from our debt transactions we issued 3000  in aggregate principal amount of 225  senior notes due 2017 the 225 notes 5000  in aggregate principal amount of 375  senior notes due 2023 the 375 notes and 2500  in aggregate principal amount of 400  senior notes due 2022  the  400  notes the proceeds from the issuance of the 400  notes were applied towards the repurchase and redemption of 3996  in aggregate principal amount of our 425  notes offsetting the net proceeds from our debt transactions was the repurchase of 327  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 3505  including fees and dividend payments of 1034  on our common stock 

foreign exchange rate changes 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a decrease of 941  in 2013  the decrease was primarily a result of the us dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies including the australian dollar brazilian real japanese yen canadian dollar and south african rand as of december 31 2013  compared to december 31 2012  

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a decrease of 62  in 2012  the decrease was a result of the us dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies including the brazilian real and south african rand offset by the us dollar being weaker than other foreign currencies including the australian dollar british pound and the euro as of as of december 31 2012  compared to december 31 2011  

  



liquidity outlook 

we expect our cash flow from operations cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months we also have a committed corporate credit facility as well as uncommitted facilities available to support our operating needs we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity with flexibility over significant uses of cash including our capital expenditures cash used for new acquisitions our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends 

from time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional funds or otherwise improve our liquidity profile enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors which include those specific to us such as our credit rating and those related to the financial markets such as the amount or terms of available credit there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

funding requirements 

our most significant funding requirements include our operations noncancelable operating lease obligations capital expenditures acquisitions common stock dividends taxes debt service restructuring and contributions to pension and postretirement plans additionally we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests 

notable funding requirements include

acquisitions we expect to pay approximately 100 in 2014  related to prioryear acquisitions we may also be required to pay approximately 210 in 2014  related to put options held by minority shareholders if exercised we will continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to grow and continue to strengthen our position particularly in our digital and marketing services offerings and to expand our presence in highgrowth and key strategic world markets 

 

 

 

the following summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations and commitments as of december 31 2013  and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 





 

share repurchase program 

in february 2012 our board authorized a program to repurchase from time to time up to 3000  excluding fees of our common stock the 2012 share repurchase program in november 2012 the board authorized an increase in the amount available under our 2012 share repurchase program up to 4000  excluding fees of our common stock as a result of the sale of our remaining holdings in facebook in february 2013 the board authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to 3000  excluding fees of our common stock the 2013 share repurchase program in march 2013 the board authorized an increase in the amount available under our 2013 share repurchase program up to 5000  excluding fees of our common stock to be used towards the repurchase of shares resulting from the conversion to common stock of the 475 notes we fully utilized the 2012 share repurchase program as of the second quarter of 2013 as of december 31 2013  1186  remained available for repurchase under the 2013 share repurchase program

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

on february 14 2014 we announced that our board had approved a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to 3000 excluding fees of our common stock the new authorization is in addition to any amounts remaining available for repurchase under the 2013 share repurchase program 

we may effect such repurchases through open market purchases trading plans established in accordance with sec rules derivative transactions or other means we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in future periods although the timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on market conditions and other funding requirements there is no expiration date associated with the share repurchase programs 

financing and sources of funds 

substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries below is a summary of our sources of liquidity 





  

 

at december 31 2013  we held 8714  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in foreign subsidiaries we have not provided us federal income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we consider such earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states if in the future we distribute these amounts to the united states an additional provision for the us income and foreign withholding taxes net of foreign tax credits could be necessary 

credit agreements 

we maintain a committed corporate credit facility to increase our financial flexibility on december 12 2013  we amended and restated our credit agreement originally dated as of july 18 2008  as amended and restated as of december 12 2013  the credit agreement the amendment extended the credit agreements expiration to december 12 2018  reduced costs and provides additional flexibility with respect to certain covenants such as restrictions on acquisitions liens and subsidiary debt the credit agreement is a revolving facility under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 10000  or the equivalent in other currencies the company continues to have the ability to increase the commitments under the credit agreement from time to time by an additional amount of up to 2500  provided the company receives commitments for such increases and satisfies certain other conditions the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of 2000  or the equivalent in other currencies we use our credit agreement to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries our obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured 

under the credit agreement we can elect to receive advances bearing interest based on either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate each as defined in the credit agreement plus an applicable margin that is determined based on our credit ratings as of december 31 2013 the applicable margin is 0275  for base rate advances and 1275  for eurocurrency rate advances letter of credit fees accrue on the average daily aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at a rate equal to the applicable margin for eurocurrency rate advances and fronting fees accrue on the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding at an annual rate of 0250  we also pay a facility fee at an annual rate of 0225  on the aggregate lending commitment under the credit agreement

the table below sets forth the financial covenants in effect as of december 31 2013  





  

 as of december 31 2013  we were in compliance with all of our covenants in the credit agreement if we were unable to comply with our covenants in the future we would seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver if we were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver the credit facility could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal in addition under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility 

we also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates as of december 31 2013  there were borrowings under some of the uncommitted facilities we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations the weightedaverage interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted credit facilities as of december 31 2013  and 2012  was approximately 40  

cash pooling 

we aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the united states we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several ipg agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of bank overdrafts under all of our pooling arrangements and as of december 31 2013  and 2012  the amounts netted were 14153  and 11663  respectively 

capped call 

 in november 2010 we purchased capped call options to hedge the risk of price appreciation on the shares of our common stock into which our 475 notes were convertible in march 2013  we exercised our capped call options and elected net share settlement we received a total of 15  settlement shares from the option counterparties as a result of exercising these options our capped call transaction met the definition of an offbalance sheet arrangement per regulation sk item 303a4 

debt credit ratings 

our longterm debt credit ratings as of february 14 2014  are listed below 



we are rated investmentgrade by both moodys investor services moodys and fitch ratings the most recent update to our credit ratings occurred in february 2013 when standard  poors changed our outlook from positive to stable a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity either adverse or favorable including among other things because they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise for example our credit agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts re ported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical acc ounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our consolidated financial statements management has discussed with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies in arranging for such services it is possible that we will enter into global regional and local agreements agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements 

revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the price is fixed or determinable iii collectability is reasonably assured and iv services have been performed depending on the terms of a client contract fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways proportional performance input or output straightline or monthly basis or completed contract 

depending on the terms of the client contract revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed commissions performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to either qualitative or quantitative goals or both performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client the classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments if the judgments change there can be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods 

the majority of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less passthrough expenses charged to a client in most cases the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our consolidated financial statements because of various passthrough expenses such as production and media costs we assess whether our agency or the thirdparty supplier is the primary obligor and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment in addition we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor because we operate broadly as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting accordingly we generally record revenue net of passthrough charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business in those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal primarily sales promotion and event sports and entertainment marketing we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as office and general expenses in general we also report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenueproducing transactions 

as we provide services as part of our core operations we generally incur incidental expenses which in practice are commonly referred to as “outofpocket” expenses these expenses often include expenses related to airfare mileage hotel stays outoftown meals and telecommunication charges we record the reimbursements received for such incidental expenses as revenue with a corresponding offset to office and general expense 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued

the determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments if we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our reported results if it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin 

we receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that based on the terms of our contracts and local law are either remitted to our clients or retained by us if amounts are to be passed through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or if retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes us federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 

we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets which is primarily dependent on future earnings a valuation allowance shall be recognized when based on available evidence it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods in circumstances where there is negative evidence establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance conversely a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance further in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings in 2013  we recorded a net charge for the establishment of valuation allowances of 32  in 2012  and 2011  we recorded a net reversal of valuation allowances of 573  and 329  respectively 

the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally guidance is provided for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments we evaluate our tax positions using the “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of october 1 st  each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we have 13  reporting units that were subject to the 2013  annual impairment testing our annual impairment review as of october 1 2013 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units 

during 2011 and 2012 we adopted new authoritative guidance for goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets respectively which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets are impaired qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings financial performance and other relevant entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or clients as well as pending litigation if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the goodwill or indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the entity is required to determine the fair value and 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value otherwise no additional testing is required 

for reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value the first step of the quantitative impairment test is performed for our annual impairment test we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units equity to the carrying value of their net assets the first step is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill the sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the first step of the quantitative impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value excluding goodwill impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

for our 2013  and 2012  annual impairment tests we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for six and nine reporting units and performed the first step of a twostep quantitative impairment test for seven and two reporting units respectively in 2013 we performed a quantitative impairment test for three of the seven reporting units due to a reorganization of their reporting unit structure for the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances including financial performance macroeconomic conditions and entityspecific factors such as client wins and losses based on this assessment we have concluded that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value therefore no additional testing was required 

the 2013  and 2012  fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data we generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approach for our analysis for the income approach we used projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth profit margins terminal value growth rates capital expenditures projections assumed tax rates discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management for the market approach we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparablecompany market multiples 

these estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit the discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit for the 2013  test the discount rates we used for our reporting units tested were between 100  and 135  and the terminal value growth rate for all seven of our reporting units tested was 30  the terminal value growth rate represents the expected longterm growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides and the global economy for the 2013  test the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 40  and 50  factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit we believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period actual results of operations cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation and it is possible that differences and changes could be material a deterioration in profitability adverse market conditions significant client losses changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future 

we also perform a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit where the low end of the range reduces growth rates by 025 and increases discount rates by 05 and the high end of the range increases growth rates by 025 and decreases discount rates by 05 we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the quantitative impairment test 

the table below displays the goodwill midpoint of the range for each reporting unit tested in the 2013  and 2012  annual impairment tests our results of the comparison between carrying value and fair value at the average fair value indicated that for the 2013  test there was one reporting unit and for the 2012  test there were no reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 



additionally we performed a sensitivity analysis and reviewed the carrying values compared to the high end and low end of the valuation range the table below displays the range of the sensitivity analysis for each reporting unit tested in the 2013  and 2012  annual impairment tests for the 2013  test using the low of the valuation range there were two reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20 but not less that 0 for the 2012  test using the low of the valuation range there were no reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20 



  based on the analysis described above for the reporting units for which we performed the first step of the quantitative impairment test we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of october 1 2013 because these reporting units passed the first step of the test as the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values 

we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets these assets are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7  and 15  years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations we determine our discount rates for our domestic pension plan significant foreign pension plans and domestic postretirement benefit plan based on either a bond selectionsettlement approach or bond yield curve approach using the bond selectionsettlement approach we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments using the bond yield curve approach we determine the discount rate by matching the plans cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve both approaches utilize highquality aarated corporate bonds and the plans projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments which is then used to develop a single discount rate in countries where 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

markets for highquality longterm aa corporate bonds are not well developed a portfolio of longterm government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate 

for the year ended december 31 2013  a discount rate of 400  was used for the domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and a weightedaverage discount rate of 432  for the significant foreign pension plans to calculate 2013  net pension and postretirement benefit costs a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2013  net pension and postretirement benefit cost by approximately 10  respectively 

as of december 31 2013  we used a discount rate of 485  for the domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans and a weightedaverage discount rate of 429  for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the december 31 2013  benefit obligation by approximately 260  and 270  respectively   

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions current and expected market conditions risk premiums associated with asset classes and longterm inflation rates we determine both a shortterm and longterm view and then select a longterm rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities 

for 2013  the weightedaverage expected rates of return of 700  and 524  were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively for 2014  we plan to use an expected rate of return of 700  and 618  for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held a lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2013  net pension cost by approximately 10  respectively

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items from time to time we use derivative instruments pursuant to established guidelines and policies to manage some portion of these risks derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rates 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations the majority of our debt approximately 89  and 93  as of december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively bears interest at fixed rates we do have debt with variable interest rates but a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a 10 change in interest rates is summarized below 



we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates we do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2013  

we had 16421  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2013  that we generally invest in conservative shortterm bank deposits or securities the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements during 2013  and 2012  we had interest income of 247  and 295  respectively   based on our 2013  results a 100basispoint increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately 164  assuming that all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from yearend 2013  levels 

foreign currency rates 

we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2013  were the australian dollar brazilian real euro japanese yen and the south african rand based on 2013  exchange rates and operating results if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10 we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase between 3  and 4  assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2013  levels 

the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency mitigating transaction risk however certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency the us dollar and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary

balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients we invest our cash primarily in investmentgrade shortterm securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 

our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods

market strategy 

we operate in a media landscape that continues to evolve at a rapid pace media channels continue to fragment and clients face an increasingly complex consumer environment to stay ahead of these challenges and to achieve our objectives we have made and continue to make investments in creative and strategic talent in fastgrowth digital marketing channels and highgrowth geographic regions and strategic world markets in addition we consistently review opportunities within our company to enhance our operations through mergers and strategic alliances as well as the development of internal programs that encourage intracompany collaboration as appropriate we also develop relationships with technology and emerging media companies that are building leadingedge marketing tools that complement our agencies skill sets and capabilities 

in recent years we have taken several major strategic steps to position our agencies as leaders in the global advertising and communications market these include 

 

digital growth 

demand for our digital marketing services continues to evolve rapidly in order to meet this need and provide highvalue resources to clients we have focused on embedding digital talent and technology throughout the organization this reflects our belief that digital marketing should not be treated as a standalone function but should instead be integrated within all of our companies mirroring the way in which consumers incorporate digital media into their other media habits and ultimately their daytoday life recruiting and developing digital expertise at all our agencies and in all marketing disciplines is an area in which we continue to invest 

to meet the changing needs of the marketplace we have acquired and incubated specialty digital assets such as reprise media search engine marketing huge ecommerce solutions cadreon audience management platform the ipg media lab as well as strategic investments in mobile marketing capabilities we have also continued to invest in existing digital assets such as rga a digital agency and industry leader in the development of awardwinning interactive campaigns for global clients as well as mrm a leading global digital agency these companies have unique capabilities and service their own client rosters while also serving as key digital partners to many of the agencies within ipg 

fastgrowth regions

acquisition strategy 

a disciplined acquisition strategy focused on highgrowth capabilities and regions of the world is one component of growing our services in todays rapidlychanging media landscape when an outstanding resource or a strong tactical fit becomes available we have been opportunistic in making tuckin niche acquisitions to enhance our service offerings our focus will continue to be predominantly on digital and marketing services agencies throughout the world as well as international growth markets we will continue to be disciplined in our investments for acquisitions and in the organic development and acquisition of talent in all of our agency brands 

in recent years ipg has acquired agencies across the marketing spectrum including firms specializing in digital mobile marketing social media healthcare communications and public relations as well as agencies with full service capabilities all of these acquired agencies have been integrated into one of our global networks or agencies

principal markets 

our agencies are located in over 100  countries including every significant world market our geographic revenue breakdown is listed below 



for further information regarding revenues and longlived assets on a geographical basis for each of the last three years see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

sources of revenue 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world our revenues are directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients and our ability to win new clients most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 90 days 

revenues for the creation planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate the difference is the commission that we earn which we either retain in full or share with the client depending on the nature of the applicable services agreement 

we also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion event marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges 

our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter fee revenue recognized on a completed contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at december 31 



see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition accounting policies 

clients 

our large and diverse client base includes many of the most recognizable companies and brands throughout the world our holding company structure allows us to maintain a diversified client base across and within a full range of industry sectors in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 22  of revenue in 2012  and 2011  our largest client accounted for approximately 4  of revenue for 2012  and 2011  based on revenue for the year ended december 31 2012  our five largest clients in alphabetical order were general motors johnson  johnson microsoft unilever and verizon we represent several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency brands representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time 

we operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry our operating companies compete against other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships 

personnel 

as of december 31 2012  we employed approximately 43300  people of whom approximately 17600  were employed in the united states because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success we conduct extensive employee training and development throughout our agencies and benchmark our compensation programs against those of our industry for their competitiveness and effectiveness in recruitment and retention there is keen competition for qualified employees

risk factors 

tableend

we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition see also statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 the marketing communications business is highly competitive our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and with other providers of creative marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets as well as new forms of market participants 

the client’s perception of the quality of our agencies’ creative work and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services may also be important competitive considerations on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time and clients may choose to terminate their contracts on a relatively short timeframe we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 

22  of revenue in 2012  a substantial decline in a large client’s advertising and marketing spending or the loss of a significant part of its business could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 

our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

 economic conditions continue to vary across geographic regions and areas of uncertainty about the prospects for continued improvements in the global economy and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing services the marketing services industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy generally in the past some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses this pattern may recur in the future if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions a decrease in our revenue could pose a challenge to our cash generation from operations 

 our employees including creative digital research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most valuable assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to identify and develop the appropriate talent and to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and other factors which may be beyond our control in addition the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 from time to time we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them see statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure  

 we maintain a 1 billion committed credit facility to increase our financial flexibility the “credit agreement” if credit under the credit agreement were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity could be adversely affected the credit agreement contains financial covenants and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them for example compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders and our costs under the credit agreement could increase if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver the credit agreement could be terminated and any outstanding amounts could be subject to acceleration furthermore the credit agreement includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions and if any of them were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institution’s commitment the availability of credit under that agreement would be correspondingly reduced 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities although to the extent possible we pay production and media charges only after we have received funds from our clients if clients are unable to pay for commitments we have entered into on their behalf there could be an adverse effect on our working capital which would negatively impact our operating cash flow 

furthermore if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook see “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 we are a global business operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues approximately 45  in 2012  these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation currency variation exchange control restrictions and difficult local political or economic conditions we also must comply with applicable us local and other international anticorruption laws which can be complex and stringent in all jurisdictions where we operate in developing countries or regions we may face further risks such as slower receipt of payments nationalization social and economic instability currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries 

in addition because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar chinese yuan renminbi euro indian rupee japanese yen pound sterling and south african rand fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results concerns persist in europe in particular over the debt burdens of certain countries that use the euro as their currency and the overall stability of the euro possible consequences such as the reintroduction of individual currencies in countries currently employing the euro or the dissolution of the euro as a common currency or market perceptions and uncertainties about the possibility and impact of such events could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and results of operations 

 we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and writeoffs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients and if these effects were severe the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity for a description of our client base see “clients” in item 1 business  

 our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation regulation judicial actions or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare our business is also subject to specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products existing and proposed laws and regulations in particular in the european union and the united states concerning user privacy use of personal information and online tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internetbased and digital marketing legislators agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products such as alcohol or tobacco and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients’ goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently on our revenues furthermore we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking work that may be challenged by consumer groups or considered controversial 

 we regularly undertake acquisitions and other investments that we believe will enhance our service offerings to our clients these transactions can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity our forecasts of the investment’s future performance also factor into the initial consideration when actual financial results differ our returns on the investment could be adversely affected 

we may also experience difficulty integrating new employees businesses assets or systems into our organization including with respect to our internal policies and required controls we may face reputational and legal risks in situations where we have a significant minority investment but limited control over the investments operations furthermore it may take longer than anticipated to realize the expected benefits from these transactions or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all talent is among our most valuable assets and we also may not realize the intended benefits of a transaction if we fail to retain targeted personnel acquisition and integration activity may also divert management’s attention and other corporate resources from other business needs if we fail to realize the intended advantages of any given investment or 

acquisition or if we do not identify or correctly measure the associated risks and liabilities our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 

 we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information developing new business opportunities and processing business transactions we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis with a large number of agencies and legal entities and the resulting size diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase the potential vulnerability of our systems to breakdown malicious intrusion or random attack likewise data privacy breaches as well as improper use of social media by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data could be exposed to third parties or to the public generally any such breakdowns or breaches in our systems or dataprotection policies could adversely affect our reputation or business   

 we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and fixed assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance 

as of december 31 2012  we have substantial amounts of longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet including approximately 36 billion  of goodwill future events including our financial performance market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies loss of a significant client’s business or strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets and our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized 

 we can be adversely affected if our credit ratings are downgraded or if they are significantly weaker than those of our competitors because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness including covenants and interest rates our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity

executive summary 

during 2012  our organic revenue increase was driven by international growth primarily from the highgrowth markets of asia pacific and latin america across our marketing disciplines our domestic revenue decline in 2012 was due to certain client losses in 2011 we had growth in the us from our integrated independent agencies and marketing services specialists we continued to have strong demand for our digital services which are embedded within all of our agency brands as well as at our digital specialist agencies our operating expenses reflected careful and effective cost management while we continued to make disciplined investments in our agencies 

with challenging economic conditions in many markets around the world particularly in the us and europe marketers continue to show a degree of caution in their marketing investment we continue to derive substantial benefit from our diversified client base our global footprint and the broad range and strength of our professional offerings we continued to enhance our businesses during 2012 by making investments in creative and strategic talent that emphasize our growth priorities fastgrowth digital marketing channels highgrowth geographic regions and strategic world markets we believe our continued investment in tools technology and process improvements will create efficiencies in the delivery of our services as we continue to evolve our services at a rapid pace in this complex and fragmented media environment we believe we are well positioned for revenue growth and operating margin expansion in the upcoming years 

we continued to enhance value to our shareholders through common stock dividends share repurchases and improvements in our balance sheet during 2012 diluted shares decreased by 11 due to share repurchases as well as the retirement of convertible debt basic earnings per share available to ipg common stockholders for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were 101 112 and 057 per share respectively diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were 094 099 and 047 per share respectively basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2012 included 014 and 012 per share respectively from the gain recorded for the sale of our remaining holdings in facebook net of tax basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31 2011 included 027 and 023 per share respectively from the gain recorded for the sale of approximately half of our holdings in facebook net of tax basic earnings per share for the year ended december 31   2010  included a benefit of 005 per share from the repurchase of a portion of our 5 1  4  series b cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock the series b preferred stock diluted earnings per share for the year ended december 31   2010  was not impacted by this benefit

the following tables present a summary of financial performance for the year ended december 31 2012  as compared with the same periods in 2011  and 2010  



when we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to changes in foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the remainder we call organic change which indicates how our underlying business performed the performance metrics that we use to evaluate our results include the organic change in revenue salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses and the components of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue additionally in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by business sector where we focus on our top 100 clients which typically constitutes approximately 55 to 60 of our annual consolidated revenues we also analyze revenue by geographic region 

the change in our operating performance attributable to changes in foreign currency rates is determined by converting the priorperiod reported results using the currentperiod exchange rates and comparing these priorperiod adjusted amounts to the priorperiod reported results although the us dollar is our reporting currency a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies therefore our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this translation risk our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar affect our consolidated results of operations and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact on us related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2012  include the brazilian real euro indian rupee and the south african rand during 2012  the us dollar was stronger relative to several foreign currencies in regions where we primarily conduct our business as compared to the prioryear period which had a net negative impact on our 2012  consolidated results of operations for 2012  foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net decreases of approximately 2 in revenues and operating expenses which had no net impact on our operating margin percentage for 2011  foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net increases of approximately 2 in revenues and operating expenses which had no net impact on our operating margin percentage 

for purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred during the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan for 2012  the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue and operating expenses compared to the prioryear period for 2011  the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures had a minimal impact on revenue and operating expenses compared to the prioryear period see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our consolidated financial statements management has discussed with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies in arranging for such services it is possible that we will enter into global regional and local agreements agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements 

revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the price is fixed or determinable iii collectability is reasonably assured and iv services have been performed depending on the terms of a client contract fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways proportional performance input or output straightline or monthly basis or completed contract 

depending on the terms of the client contract revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed commissions performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to either qualitative or quantitative goals or both performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client the classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments if the judgments change there can be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods 

the majority of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less passthrough expenses charged to a client in most cases the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our consolidated financial statements because of various passthrough expenses such as production and media costs we assess whether our agency or the thirdparty supplier is the primary obligor and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment in addition we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor because we operate broadly as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting accordingly we generally record revenue net of passthrough charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business in those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal primarily sales promotion and event sports and entertainment marketing we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as office and general expenses in general we also report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenueproducing transactions 

as we provide services as part of our core operations we generally incur incidental expenses which in practice are commonly referred to as “outofpocket” expenses these expenses often include expenses related to airfare mileage hotel stays outoftown meals and telecommunication charges we record the reimbursements received for such incidental expenses as revenue with a corresponding offset to office and general expense 

the determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments if we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our reported results if it were determined that 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin 

we receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that based on the terms of our contracts and local law are either remitted to our clients or retained by us if amounts are to be passed through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or if retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned income or expense may also be realized in connection with differences resulting from settling vendor discount or credit liabilities that were established as part of the restatement we presented in our 2004 annual report on form 10k the “2004 restatement” in these situations or if we release certain of these credit liabilities when the statute of limitations has lapsed given the historical nature of these liabilities we generally record such items as other income net as we do not consider these to be part of current operating results 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes us federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 

we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets which is primarily dependent on future earnings a valuation allowance shall be recognized when based on available evidence it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods in circumstances where there is negative evidence establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance conversely a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance further in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings in 2012  2011  and 2010  we recorded a net reversal of valuation allowances of 573  329  and 24  respectively 

the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally guidance is provided for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments we evaluate our tax positions using the “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method which requires us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of october 1 st  each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we have 11  reporting units that were subject to the 2012  annual impairment testing during 2012  our reporting unit structure changed due to the creation of a new reporting unit which had been previously included within an existing reporting unit as well as the disposal of a reporting unit our annual impairment review as of october 1 2012 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units 

we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets these assets are impaired 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

when their carrying value exceeds their fair value impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7  and 15  years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

in 2011  we adopted new authoritative guidance for goodwill which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is “more likely than not” less than its carrying value qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other relevant entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or clients as well as pending litigation if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value then the entity is required to perform the first step of a twostep quantitative impairment test to identify and measure impairment if necessary otherwise no additional testing is required 

for reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value the first step of the quantitative impairment test is performed for our annual impairment test we compare the respective fair value of our reporting units equity to the carrying value of their net assets the first step is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill the sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the first step of the quantitative impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill to its carrying value the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value excluding goodwill impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

for both our 2012  and 2011  annual impairment tests we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for nine reporting units and performed the first step of a twostep quantitative impairment test for two reporting units for the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances including financial performance macroeconomic conditions and entityspecific factors such as client wins and losses based on this assessment we have concluded that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value therefore no additional testing was required 

the 2012  and 2011  fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data we generally applied an equal weighting to the income and market approach for our analysis for the income approach we used projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth profit margins terminal value growth rates capital expenditures projections assumed tax rates discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management for the market approach we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparablecompany market multiples 

these estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit the discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit for 2012  the discount rates we used for our reporting units tested were between 130  and 140  and the terminal value growth rate for both of our reporting units tested was 30  the terminal value growth rate represents the expected longterm growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides and the global economy for 2012  the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 20  and 40  factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit we believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period actual results of operations cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation and it is possible that differences and changes could be material a deterioration in profitability adverse market conditions significant client losses changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future 

we also perform a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit where the low end of 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

the range reduces growth rates by 025 and increases discount rates by 05 and the high end of the range increases growth rates by 025 and decreases discount rates by 05 we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the quantitative impairment test 

the table below displays the goodwill midpoint of the range for each reporting unit tested in the 2012  and 2011  annual impairment tests for 2012  and 2011  our results for the comparison between carrying value and fair value at the average fair value indicated that there were no  reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20 



additionally we performed a sensitivity analysis and reviewed the carrying values compared to the high end and low end of the valuation range the table below displays the range of the sensitivity analysis for each reporting unit tested in the 2012 and 2011 annual impairment tests for 2012 using the low of the valuation range there were no reporting units whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20 for 2011 using the lowend of the valuation range there was one reporting unit with 1500 of associated goodwill whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 20 



  based on the analysis described above for the reporting units for which we performed the first step of the quantitative impairment test we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of october 1 2012 because these reporting units passed the first step of the test as the fair values of each of the reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values 

pension and postretirement benefit plans 

we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations at december 31 2012  we determined our discount rates for our domestic pension plan significant foreign pension plans and domestic postretirement benefit plan based on either a bond selectionsettlement approach or bond yield curve approach using the bond selectionsettlement approach we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments using the bond yield curve approach we determine the discount rate by matching the plans cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve both approaches utilize highquality aarated corporate bonds and the plans projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments which is then used to develop a single discount rate in countries where markets for highquality longterm aa corporate bonds are not well developed a portfolio of longterm government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate 

a weightedaverage discount rate of 500  was used in the calculation of 2012  net pension and postretirement benefit costs for the domestic pension plan significant foreign pension plans and the domestic postretirement benefit plan a lower discount rate would increase our net pension and postretirement benefit costs a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2012  net pension and postretirement benefit cost by approximately 10  

at december 31 2012  we used a discount rate of 400  for the domestic pension and domestic postretirement benefit plans and a weightedaverage discount rate of 432  for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the december 31 2012  benefit obligation by approximately 240  and 250  respectively   

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions current and expected market conditions risk premiums associated with asset classes and longterm inflation 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

rates we determine both a shortterm and longterm view and then select a longterm rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities 

for 2012  the weightedaverage expected rates of return of 725  and 502  were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively for 2013  we plan to use an expected rate of return of 700  and 523  for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held a lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2012  net pension cost by approximately 10

consolidated results of operations 

revenue 

our revenue is directly impacted by our ability to win new clients and the retention and spending levels of existing clients most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter in the events marketing business revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete we generally act as principal for these projects and accordingly record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as passthrough costs in office and general expenses   



during 2012  our revenue decreased by 584  or 08  compared to 2011  due to an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 1476  partially offset by an organic revenue increase of 474  or 07  and the effect of net acquisitions of 418  our organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to new client wins and net higher spending from existing clients in our international markets we had strong growth in the asia pacific region primarily in australia singapore india and china and in the latin america region predominantly in brazil also contributing to our international organic revenue increase was an increase in the united kingdom predominately due to our events marketing business which benefited from work performed in connection with the olympics in the third quarter the organic revenue increase in our international markets was throughout nearly all client sectors most notably in the retail and technology and telecom sectors partially offset by a decrease in the consumer goods sector due to net client losses in the prior year our revenue decreased in the continental europe region primarily in spain and italy due to a continued challenging economic climate this was partially offset by growth in germany in our domestic market our organic revenue decrease was due to net client losses in the prior year most notably in the consumer goods and technology and telecom sectors and a decline in spending from existing clients primarily in the retail and health care sectors partially offsetting this decline in the domestic market was an organic revenue increase in the auto and transportation and financial services sectors 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 



during 2011  our revenue increased by 5073  or 78  compared to 2010  primarily consisting of an organic revenue increase of 3937  or 61  and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 1222  our organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to net higher spending from existing clients across all major client sectors and throughout nearly all geographic regions led by the domestic market the sectors that primarily contributed to our organic revenue increase were technology and telecom and auto and transportation in the international markets the most notable organic revenue increases occurred in the latin america region primarily in brazil in the asia pacific region primarily in china and india and to a lesser extent in the united kingdom the continental europe region was essentially flat as results varied by european country due to a challenging economic climate in the region

operating expenses 



salaries and related expenses 

salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs employee performance incentives including annual bonus and longterm incentive awards costs for temporary workers and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with shortterm changes in revenue levels however salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of the hiring of personnel to support revenue growth and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards additionally we may take severance actions in areas where we have or anticipate decreases in operating performance changes in our incentive awards mix can impact futureperiod expense as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year they are earned and longterm incentive awards are expensed over the performance period generally three years factors impacting longterm incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting the change in our stock price actual results and changes to our projected results which could impact the achievement of certain performance targets 



our staff cost ratio defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue increased in 2012  to 631  from 628  in 2011  salaries and related expenses in 2012  decreased by 102  compared to 2011  due to a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 856  partially offset by an organic increase of 409  and the effect of net acquisitions of 345  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

the organic increase was primarily due to an increase in base salaries benefits and temporary help of 964 primarily attributable to increases in our workforce in international regions most notably in the asia pacific and latin america regions and businesses where we had revenue growth as well as modest wage increases our workforce decreased in regions and businesses where we had revenue declines as we have been disciplined in managing our workforce partially offsetting this organic increase was a reduction in incentive award expense of 511 resulting from lower financial performance compared to targets 

our staff cost ratio decreased in 2011  to 628  from 633  in 2010  salaries and related expenses in 2011  increased by 2851  compared to 2010  primarily consisting of an organic increase of 2091  and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 749  the organic increase of 51  was lower than our organic revenue increase of 61  due to our cost discipline during the year the organic increase was primarily attributable to increases in our workforce to support business growth resulting in an increase in base salaries benefits and temporary help of 1894 hiring began in 2010 and sequentially decreased by quarter through 2011 also contributing to the organic increase but to a lesser extent was higher incentive award expense primarily due to continued improvement in operating results in 2011 the organic increase occurred across all regions primarily in our domestic market 

the following table details our staff cost ratio 



office and general expenses 

office and general expenses primarily include rent expense professional fees certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and depreciation and amortization costs office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements including production costs outofpocket costs such as travel for client service staff and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients production expenses can vary significantly between periods depending upon the timing of completion of certain projects where we act as principal which could impact trends between various periods in the future 



our office and general expense ratio defined as office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue decreased in 2012  to 271  from 274  in 2011  office and general expenses in 2012  decreased by 393  compared to 2011  due to a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 407  and an organic decrease of 70  partially offset by the effect of net acquisitions of 84  the organic decrease was primarily attributable to lower occupancy costs as we continue to find efficiencies in our real estate portfolio and professional fees the organic decrease was partially offset by higher production expenses in our international markets most notably in the asia pacific region and in the united kingdom related to passthrough costs which are also reflected in revenue for certain projects where we acted as principal that increased in size or were new during 2012  

our office and general expense ratio decreased in 2011  to 274  from 283  in 2010  office and general expenses in 2011  increased by 837  compared to 2010  primarily consisting of an organic increase of 543  and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 343  the organic increase was primarily attributable to continued business growth in 2011 which resulted in higher production expenses related to passthrough costs for certain projects where we acted as a principal that increased in size or were new during 2011 also contributing to the organic increase but to a lesser extent was higher discretionary spending to support business growth

expenses and other income 



net interest expense 

for 2012  net interest expense increased by 50  as compared to 2011  primarily due to an increase in noncash interest expense noncash interest expense increased since the premium associated with our 425  convertible senior notes due 2023  the  425  notes which we retired in march 2012 was fully amortized cash interest expense decreased primarily due to the retirement of our 425 notes which was offset by lower interest income primarily in the united states due to lower cash balances 

for 2011  net interest expense decreased by 120  as compared to 2010  primarily due to an increase in interest income interest income increased primarily due to an increase in average cash and cash equivalent balances and an increase in average interest rates in certain countries around the world compared to the prioryear period interest expense decreased primarily due to repayment of debt obligations in 2010 partially offset by higher interest expense in certain countries outside of the united states

vendor discounts and credit adjustments – we are in the process of settling our liabilities related to vendor discounts and credits established as part of the 2004 restatement these adjustments reflect the reversal of certain of these liabilities as a result of differences resulting from settlements with clients or vendors or where the statute of limitations has lapsed 

income taxes 



our tax rates are affected by many factors including our worldwide earnings from various countries changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income in 2012  our effective income tax rate of 316  was positively impacted by the reversals of valuation allowances associated with the asia pacific and continental europe regions of 262  and 218  respectively as well as by a benefit derived from the deduction of foreign tax credits that previously had a full valuation allowance our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by an adjustment of 195  associated with the establishment of a previously unrecorded reserve for a tax contingency for the years 2007 through 2010 losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances and state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefit 

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 the act was signed into law and is effective in the first quarter of 2013 the act contains various provisions which should be beneficial to the company and while we continue to assess the current and future impact of this act we do not expect it to have a material impact to our effective or cash tax rates in the near future 

in 2011  our effective income tax rate of 258  was positively impacted primarily from the utilization of capital losses to offset nearly all of the 1322  capital gain realized from the facebook transaction the capital gain enabled us to use capital loss carryforwards on which a 100 valuation allowance had been previously established and capital losses attributable to worthless securities in a consolidated subsidiary additionally the effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the effective settlement of the 20072008 irs audit cycle a lower effective income tax rate on nonus operations and the net reversal of valuation allowances primarily in europe the effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by state and local taxes and losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances the settlement of the 20072008 audit cycle resulted in no cash payment 

in 2010  our effective income tax rate of 380  was positively impacted by reversals of valuation allowances in canada and the united kingdom our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and the taxation of foreign operations which included an income tax assessment in latin america during 2010  we effectively settled with the united kingdom tax authorities for the 2007 and 2008 tax years which resulted in no cash payment also in 2010  we effectively settled our new york state examination for the 19992001 tax years this settlement resulted in a cash payment of 117 consisting of 54 of tax and 63 of interest which was previously reserved

revenue 



during 2012  ian revenue decreased by 1633  compared to 2011  due to an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 1387  and an organic revenue decrease of 444  partially offset by the effect of net acquisitions of 198  the organic revenue decrease was attributable to a decline in our domestic market due to net client losses in the prior year most notably in the consumer goods and technology and telecom sectors and a decline in spending from existing clients primarily in the health care and retail sectors partially offsetting this decline in the domestic market were increases in the auto and transportation and financial services sectors in our international markets our organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to net client wins and net higher spending from existing clients throughout nearly all client sectors most notably in the asia pacific region primarily in australia and india and in the latin america region predominantly in brazil the sectors primarily contributing to the international organic revenue increase were the retail and technology and telecom sectors which was partially offset by a decrease in the consumer goods sector the international organic revenue increase was partially offset by an organic revenue decrease in the continental europe region primarily due to a continued challenging economic climate

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow overview

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities  during 2012  was 3572  which is an increase of 837  as compared to 2011  primarily as a result of a decrease in working capital usage of 662  the net working capital usage in 2012  was primarily impacted by our media businesses 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2011  was 2735  which was a decrease of 5438  as compared to 2010 primarily as a result of a use of cash from working capital in 2011 of 3594  as compared to a generation of cash in 2010 of 2632  due to the seasonality of our business we typically generate cash from working capital in the second half of a year and use cash from working capital in the first half of a year with the largest impacts in the first and fourth quarters in the fourth quarter of 2010 we had significant cash generation from working capital primarily due to a high rate of growth in our media businesses which resulted in comparable working capital usage in the first quarter of 2011 our net working capital usage in 2011 was also impacted by slower growth in those same businesses compared to the prior year 

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued liabilities our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers 

our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments for example while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during 2012  primarily relates to payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by the net proceeds of 948  received from the sale of our remaining holdings in facebook capital expenditures of 1692  relate primarily to computer software and hardware and leasehold improvements capital expenditures increased in 2012  compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in leasehold improvements made during the year payments for acquisitions of 1455  primarily relate to payments for new acquisitions

financing activities 

net cash provided by financing activities during 2012  primarily reflects net proceeds from our debt transactions we issued 3000  in aggregate principal amount of 225  senior notes due 2017  the  225  notes 5000  in aggregate principal amount of 375  senior notes due 2023  the  375  notes and 2500  in aggregate principal amount of 400  senior notes due 2022  the  400  notes the proceeds from the issuance of the 400  notes were applied towards the repurchase and redemption of 3996 in aggregate principal amount of our 425  notes we intend to apply the net proceeds from the sale of the 225 and 375 notes towards the redemption of our 2000 in aggregate principal amount of our 475 convertible senior notes due 2023  the  475  notes and our 6000 in aggregate principal amount of our 1000 senior notes due 2017 the 1000 notes offsetting the net proceeds from our debt transactions was the repurchase of 327  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 3505  including fees and dividend payments of 1034  on our common stock

foreign exchange rate changes 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a decrease of 62  in 2012  the decrease was a result of the us dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies including the brazilian real and south african rand offset by the us dollar being weaker than other foreign currencies including the australian dollar british pound and the euro as of december 31 2012  compared to december 31 2011  

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a decrease of 467  in 2011  the decrease was a result of the us dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies including the euro and brazilian real as of december 31 2011  compared to december 31 2010  

  

liquidity outlook 

we expect our cash flow from operations cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months we also have a committed corporate credit facility available to support our operating needs we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to managing liquidity with flexibility over significant uses of cash including our capital expenditures cash used for new acquisitions our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends 

from time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional financing or otherwise improve our liquidity profile enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors which include those specific to us such as our credit rating and those related to the financial markets such as the amount or terms of available credit there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

funding requirements 

our most significant funding requirements include our operations noncancelable operating lease obligations capital expenditures acquisitions dividends taxes debt service and contributions to pension and postretirement plans additionally we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options to sell us their equity interests

financing and sources of funds 

substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries below is a summary of our sources of liquidity 





  

 

at december 31 2012  we held 8835  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities in foreign subsidiaries we have not provided us federal income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we consider such earnings to be permanently reinvested outside the united states if in the future we distribute these amounts to the united states an additional provision for the us income and foreign withholding taxes net of foreign tax credits could be necessary 

credit facilities 

we maintain a committed corporate credit facility to increase our financial flexibility the credit agreement the credit agreement is a revolving facility expiring may 31 2016 under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 10000  or the equivalent in other currencies the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of 2000  or the equivalent in other currencies our obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured we use our credit agreement to provide letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries 

the credit agreement includes covenants that among other things limit our liens and the liens of our consolidated subsidiaries and limit subsidiary debt the financial covenants in the credit agreement require that we maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter certain financial measures for the four quarters then ended in november 2012 we entered into an amendment to our credit agreement which modified the definition of “total debt” in the credit agreement to disregard until august 15 2013 the 3000  in aggregate principal amount of the 225  notes and the 5000  in aggregate principal amount of the 375  notes that we issued in november 2012 subject to the reduction of this disregarded amount by the amount of any reductions in the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 475 notes or the 1000 notes as a result of this amendment these notes will have no impact on our financial covenants in the credit agreement until august 15 2013

the table below sets forth the financial covenants in effect as of december 31 2012  





  

 as of december 31 2012  we were in compliance with all of our covenants in the credit agreement if we were unable to comply with our covenants in the future we would seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver if we were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver the credit facility could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal in addition under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility 

we also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates we use our uncommitted credit lines for working capital needs at some of our operations outside the united states we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations the weightedaverage interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted credit facilities as of december 31 2012  and 2011  was approximately 40  and 50  respectively 

capped call 

in november 2010 we purchased capped call options to hedge the risk of price appreciation on the shares of our common stock into which our 475  notes are convertible the strike price and cap price related to the capped call options are listed below 



during 2012  and 2011  the strike price and cap price related to the capped call options were adjusted due to the payment of cash dividends on our common stock as of december 31 2012  the options give us the right to purchase up to 169  shares of our common stock at the strike price except that the net proceeds of exercising the options will not exceed the difference between 1743  and 1186  subject to certain limitations we may elect settlement of the options to occur in cash or in shares the options will expire on april 2 2013  our capped call transaction meets the definition of an offbalance sheet arrangement per regulation sk item 303a4 

cash pooling 

we aggregate our domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the united states we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several ipg agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides for overdrafts on the net balance for all the agencies up to an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of bank overdrafts under all of our pooling arrangements and as of december 31 2012  and 2011  the amounts netted were 11663  and 11066  respectively

debt credit ratings 

our longterm debt credit ratings as of february 13 2013  are listed below 



we are investmentgrade rated by both moodys investor services moodys and fitch ratings the most recent update to our credit ratings occurred in february 2012 when standard  poors placed our credit rating on positive credit watch a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity either adverse or favorable including among other things because they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise for example our credit agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

amounts in millions 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items from time to time we use derivative instruments pursuant to established guidelines and policies to manage some portion of these risks derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rates 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value and cash flows of our debt obligations the majority of our debt approximately 93  and 91  as of december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively bears interest at fixed rates we do have debt with variable interest rates but a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a 10 change in interest rates is summarized below 



we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates during 2012  we entered into and exited forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in the benchmark rate related to our 375 senior notes due 2023 which we issued in november 2012 we do not have any interest rate swaps outstanding as of december 31 2012  

we had 25908  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2012  that we generally invest in conservative shortterm investmentgrade securities the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements during 2012  and 2011  we had interest income of 295  and 378  respectively based on our 2012  results a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately 260  assuming that all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from yearend 2012  levels 

foreign currency rates 

we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2012  were the brazilian real euro indian rupee and the south african rand based on 2012  exchange rates and operating results if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10 we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase between 3  and 5  assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2012  levels 

the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency mitigating transaction risk however certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency the us dollar and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary our venezuela agencies transitioned to inflationary accounting on january 1 2010 and as a result we recorded a foreign exchange translation loss of approximately 50 in 2010 this charge was recorded in office and general expenses within the consolidated 

statements of operations in 2010 we remeasured our local nonmonetary transactions assets and liabilities using the exchange rate of 43 venezuelan bolivares fuertes per us dollar subsequent to the currency remeasurement this devaluation did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements as we do not have significant operations in venezuela 

credit and market risks 

balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients we invest our cash primarily in investmentgrade shortterm securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas we perform ongoing credit evaluations on a large number of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 

our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods

in recent years we have taken several major strategic steps to position our agencies as leaders in the global advertising and communications market these include 

 

digital growth 

demand for our digital marketing services continues to evolve rapidly in order to meet this need and provide highvalue resources to clients we have in recent years focused our investment in embedding digital talent and technology throughout the organization this reflects our belief that digital marketing cannot be treated as a standalone function but should instead be integrated within all of our companies mirroring the way in which consumers incorporate digital media into their other media habits and ultimately their daytoday life recruiting and developing digital expertise at all our agencies and in all marketing disciplines is an area in which we continue to invest 

to meet the changing needs of the marketplace we have acquired or incubated specialty digital assets such as reprise media search engine marketing huge ecommerce solutions cadreon demandside platform and the ipg media lab we have also continued to invest in existing digital assets such as rga a digital agency and industry leader in the development of awardwinning interactive campaigns for global clients as well as mrm a leading global digital agency these companies have unique capabilities and service their own client rosters while also serving as key digital partners to many of the agencies within ipg

principal markets 

our agencies are located in over 100  countries including every significant world market our geographic revenue breakdown is listed below 



for further information regarding revenues and longlived assets on a geographical basis for each of the last three years see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

sources of revenue 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of multichannel advertising marketing and communications programs around the world our revenue is directly dependent upon our ability to win new clients and the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 90 days 

revenues for the creation planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate the difference is the commission that we earn which we either retain in full or share with the client depending on the nature of the applicable services agreement 

we also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion event marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges 

our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter fee revenue recognized on a completed contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at december 31 



see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition accounting policies 

clients 

our large and diverse client base includes many of the most recognizable companies and brands throughout the world our holding company structure allows us to maintain a diversified client base across and within a full range of industry sectors in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 22  and 24  of revenue in 2011  and 2010  respectively our largest client accounted for approximately 4  and 5  of revenue for 2011  and 2010  respectively based on revenue for the year ended december 31 2011  our five largest clients in alphabetical order were general motors johnson  johnson microsoft unilever and verizon we represent several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency systems representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time 

we operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry our operating companies compete against other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships 

personnel 

as of december 31 2011  we employed approximately 42000  people of whom approximately 18000  were employed in the united states because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business the quality of personnel 

is of crucial importance to our continuing success we conduct extensive employee training and development throughout our agencies and benchmark our compensation programs against those of our industry for their competitiveness and effectiveness in recruitment and retention there is keen competition for qualified employees

risk factors 

tableend

we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition see also “statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure” 

 the marketing communications business is highly competitive our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and with other providers of creative marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets new market participants include database marketing and modeling companies telemarketers and internet companies 

the client’s perception of the quality of our agencies’ creative work and its relationships with key personnel at the company or our agencies are important factors that affect our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis and across a range of services may also be important competitive considerations on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time and clients may choose to terminate their contracts on a relatively short timeframe we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 22  of revenue in 2011  a substantial decline in a large client’s advertising and marketing spending or the loss of a significant part of its business could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 

our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

  while we have seen economic recovery in most of our key markets during 2011  the strength and duration of the recovery has varied across geographic regions and areas of uncertainty about the prospects for continued improvements in the global economy and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing services in particular the uneven pace of recovery in certain european markets has contributed to concerns over future growth in these markets in 2011 continental europe and the united kingdom accounted for 130 and 77 of our revenue respectively the marketing services industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy generally in the past some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses for example we experienced a 108 organic revenue decline during 2009 this pattern may recur in the future if our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions a decrease in our revenue could pose a challenge to our cash generation from operations 

 our employees including creative digital research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most valuable assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and other factors which may be beyond our control in addition the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 from time to time we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them similarly we may not realize the intended advantages of past or future investments or acquisitions of businesses because we may incorrectly evaluate risks and benefits from these transactions or have unforeseen difficulties integrating them into our organization see “statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure” 

 we maintain a committed credit facility to increase our financial flexibility as amended and restated as of may 31 2011 the “credit agreement” the credit agreement contains financial covenants and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them for example compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement we could be required to seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders and our costs under the credit agreement could increase if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver the credit agreement could be terminated furthermore the credit agreement includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions and if any of them were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institution’s commitment the availability of credit under that agreement would be correspondingly reduced if credit under the credit agreement were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity could be adversely affected 

if our business or financial needs lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook see “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 we are a global business operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues approximately 45  in 2011  these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation currency variation exchange control restrictions and difficult local political or economic conditions in developing countries or regions we may face further risks such as slower receipt of payments nationalization social and economic instability currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries 

in addition because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar chinese yuan renminbi euro japanese yen and pound sterling fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results concerns persist in europe in particular over the debt burdens of certain countries that use the euro as their currency and the overall stability of the euro possible consequences such as the reintroduction of individual currencies in countries currently employing the euro or the dissolution of the euro as a common currency or market perceptions and uncertainties about the possibility and impact of such events could adversely affect the value of our eurodenominated assets and results of operations 

 we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and writeoffs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients and if these effects were severe the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity for a description of our client base see “clients” in item 1 business 

 our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation regulation judicial actions or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare our business is also subject to specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products existing and proposed laws and regulations in particular in the european union and the united states concerning user privacy use of personal information and online tracking technologies could affect the efficacy and profitability of internetbased and digital marketing legislators agencies and other governmental units may also continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products such as alcohol or tobacco and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients’ goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently on our revenues furthermore we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking controversial work that may be challenged by consumer groups 

 we rely extensively and increasingly on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our business including recording marketing strategies and client information developing new business opportunities and processing business transactions we operate in many respects on a decentralized basis with a large number of agencies and legal entities and the resulting size diversity and disparity of our technology systems and complications in implementing standardized technologies and procedures could increase the potential vulnerability of our systems to breakdown malicious intrusion or random attack likewise data privacy breaches as well as improper use of social media by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data could be exposed to third parties or to the public generally any such breakdowns or breaches in our systems or dataprotection policies could adversely affect our reputation or business   

 we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and fixed assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance 

as of december 31 2011  we have substantial amounts of longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet including approximately 34 billion  of goodwill future events including our financial performance market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies loss of a significant client’s business or strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets and our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized 

 we can be adversely affected if our credit ratings are downgraded or if they are significantly weaker than those of our competitors because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness including covenants and interest rates our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity

when we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the remainder we call organic change which indicates how our underlying business performed the performance metrics that we use to evaluate our results include the organic change in revenue salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses and the components of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue additionally in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by business sector where we focus on our top 100 clients which typically constitutes approximately 5560 of our annual consolidated revenues we also analyze revenue by geographic region 

the change in our operating performance attributable to foreign currency rates is determined by converting the priorperiod reported results using the currentperiod exchange rates and comparing these priorperiod adjusted amounts to the priorperiod reported results although the us dollar is our reporting currency a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies therefore our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this translation risk our exposure is mitigated as the majority of our revenues and expenses in any given market are generally denominated in the same currency both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar affect our consolidated results of operations and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact on us related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2011  include the australian dollar brazilian real euro japanese yen and pound sterling during 2011  the us dollar was weaker as compared to all foreign currencies in regions where we primarily conduct our business as compared to the prioryear period which had a positive impact on our revenue and operating income for 2011  foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net increases of approximately 2 in revenues and operating expenses which had no impact on our operating margin percentage for 2010  foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net increases of approximately 1 in revenues and operating expenses which also had no impact on our operating margin percentage in recent months the us dollar has strengthened against certain currencies and at current exchange rates the result would be a slight negative impact on our 2012 revenue and operating income 

for purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred during the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan for 2011  and 2010  the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures had a minimal impact on revenue and operating expenses compared to the respective prioryear period see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our acquisitions

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our consolidated financial statements management has discussed with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising marketing and communications programs in various media around the world most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies in arranging for such services it is possible that we will enter into global regional and local agreements agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements 

revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the price is fixed or determinable iii collectability is reasonably assured and iv services have been performed depending on the terms of a client contract fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways proportional performance input or output straightline or monthly basis or completed contract 

depending on the terms of the client contract revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed commissions performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to either qualitative or quantitative goals or both performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client the classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments if the judgments change there can be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods 

the majority of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less passthrough expenses charged to a client in most cases the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our consolidated financial statements because of various passthrough expenses such as production and media costs we assess whether our agency or the thirdparty supplier is the primary obligor and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment in addition we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor because we operate broadly as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting accordingly we generally record revenue net of passthrough charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business in those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal primarily sales promotion and event sports and entertainment marketing we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related incremental direct costs incurred as office and general expenses in general we also report revenue net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenueproducing transactions 

the determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments if we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our financial performance if it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin 

we receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that based on the terms of our contracts and local law are either remitted to our clients or retained by us if amounts are to be passed through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or if retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned income or

expense may also be realized in connection with settling vendor discount or credit liabilities that were established as part of the restatement we presented in our 2004 annual report on form 10k the “2004 restatement” in these situations and given the historical nature of these liabilities we generally record such items as other income or expense as we do not consider these to be part of current operating results 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes us federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes 

we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets which is primarily dependent on future earnings a valuation allowance shall be recognized when based on available evidence it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods in circumstances where there is negative evidence establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance conversely a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance further in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings in 2011  and 2010  we recorded a net reversal of valuation allowances of 329  and 24  respectively in 2009  we recorded a net charge for the establishment of valuation allowances of 124  

the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement reporting of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally guidance is provided for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments we evaluate our tax positions using the prescribed “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we have accounted for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method beginning in 2009 while we utilized the purchase accounting method in prior years both accounting methods require us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of october 1 st  each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we have 11  reporting units that were subject to the 2011  annual impairment testing our reporting unit structure did not change during 2011  our annual impairment reviews as of october 1 2011 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units 

we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets these assets are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7  and 15  years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued

we have adopted new authoritative guidance for goodwill which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value qualitative factors to consider may include macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors that may have a negative effect on earnings overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other relevant entityspecific events such as changes in management key personnel strategy or clients as well as contemplation of bankruptcy or pending litigation if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances such as those described above an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value then the entity is required to perform a twostep quantitative impairment test to identify and measure impairment if necessary otherwise no additional testing is required 

for reporting units not included in the qualitative assessment or for any reporting units identified in the qualitative assessment as more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value the first step of the quantitative impairment test is performed the first step is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill the sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the first step of the impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

for our 2011  annual impairment test we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for nine reporting units and performed the twostep quantitative impairment test for two reporting units for the qualitative analysis we took into consideration all the relevant events and circumstances in accordance with the authoritative guidance including financial performance macroeconomic conditions and entityspecific factors such as client winslosses based on this assessment we have concluded that for each of our reporting units subject to the qualitative assessment it is not “more likely than not” that its fair value was less than its carrying value therefore no additional testing was required 

the 2011  and 2010  fair values of reporting units for which we performed quantitative impairment tests were estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data we primarily applied an equal weighting to the income and market approach for our analysis for the income approach we used projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth profit margins terminal value growth rates capital expenditures projections assumed tax rates discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management for the market approach we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparablecompany market multiples 

these estimates and assumptions may vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit the discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit for 2011  the discount rate we used for both of our reporting units tested was 125  and the terminal value growth rate for both of our reporting units tested was 30  the terminal value growth rate represents the expected longterm growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides and the global economy for 2011  the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 50  and 60  factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit we believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period actual results of operations cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation and it is possible that differences and changes could be material a deterioration in profitability adverse market conditions significant client losses changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit where the low end of the range reduces growth rates by 05 and increases discount rates by 05 and the high end of the range increases growth rates by 05 and decreases discount rates by 05 we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the impairment test 

the following table shows the number of reporting units we tested in our 2011  and 2010  annual impairment tests and the related goodwill value associated with the reporting units at the low end average and high end of the valuation range for a fair values exceeding carrying values by less than 10 b fair values exceeding carrying values between 10 and 20 and c fair values exceeding carrying values by more than 20 in 2011  and 2010  our results for the comparison between carrying value

and fair value at the low end average and high end of the valuation range indicated that there were no  reporting units whose carrying values exceeded their respective fair value 





 

the table above displays the information related to our 2011  and 2010  annual impairment tests we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the impairment test in 2011  our results for the comparison between carrying value and fair value at the average fair value indicated that there were no  reporting units whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10 additionally we performed a sensitivity analysis and reviewed the carrying values compared to the low and high end of the valuation range using both the low end and high end of the valuation range there were no  reporting units whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10 

for 2010  using the average fair value there was one  reporting unit with 1500  of associated goodwill whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 10 using the low end of the valuation range there were two  reporting units with 5892  of associated goodwill whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10 using the high end of the valuation range there were no  reporting units whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10 

pension and postretirement benefits 

we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations at december 31 2011 we determined our discount rates for our domestic pension plan significant foreign pension plans and domestic postretirement benefit plan based on either a bond selectionsettlement approach or bondyield curve approach using the bond selectionsettlement approach we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments using the bondyield curve approach we determine the discount rate by matching the plans cash flows to spot rates developed from a yield curve both approaches utilize highquality aarated corporate bonds and the plans projected cash flows to develop a discounted value of the benefit payments which is then used to develop a single discount rate in countries where markets for highquality longterm aa corporate bonds are not well developed a portfolio of longterm government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate weightedaverage discount rates of 550  545  and 550  were used in the calculation of 2011  net pension and postretirement benefit costs for the domestic pension plan significant foreign pension plans and the domestic postretirement 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued

benefit plan respectively a lower discount rate would increase our net pension and postretirement benefit costs a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2011  net pension and postretirement benefit cost by approximately 10  and 20  respectively 

at december 31 2011  we used a discount rate of 500  for the domestic pension and domestic postretirement benefit plans and a weightedaverage discount rate of 500  for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the december 31 2011  benefit obligation by approximately 220  and 230  respectively   

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions current and expected market conditions risk premiums associated with asset classes and longterm inflation rates we determine both a shortterm and longterm view and then select a longterm rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities 

for 2011  the weightedaverage expected rates of return of 750  and 588  were used in the calculation of net pension costs for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively for 2012 we plan to use an expected rate of return of 725  and 502  for the domestic and significant foreign pension plans respectively changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held a lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2011  net pension cost by approximately 10

consolidated results of operations 

revenue 

our revenue is directly dependent upon our ability to win new clients and the retention and spending levels of existing clients most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter in the events marketing business revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete we generally act as principal for these projects and accordingly record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as passthrough costs in office and general expenses   



during 2011  our revenue increased by 5073  or 78  compared to 2010  primarily consisting of an organic revenue increase of 3937  or 61  and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 1222  our organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to net higher spending from existing clients across all major client sectors and throughout nearly all geographic regions led by the domestic market the sectors that primarily contributed to our organic revenue increase were technology and telecom and auto and transportation in the international markets the most notable organic revenue increases occurred in the latin america region primarily in brazil in the asia pacific region primarily in china and india and to a lesser extent in the united kingdom the continental europe region was essentially flat as results varied by european country due to a challenging economic climate in the region

during 2010  our revenue increased by 4999  or 83  compared to 2009  primarily consisting of an organic revenue increase of 4196  or 70  and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 633  the organic increase was primarily attributable to higher spending from existing clients and net client wins in nearly all sectors of our business and throughout most geographic regions led by the domestic market the sectors which contributed the most to our organic revenue increase were auto and transportation and financial services the auto and transportation financial services and technology and telecom sectors were the primary sectors that were negatively impacted by the global recession in 2009 although our technology and telecom sector experienced a slight organic revenue decrease for the full year 2010 this sector had an organic revenue increase in the second half of 2010 as the impact of certain lost assignments in the prior year diminished our international organic revenue increase was most notably in the latin america region primarily in brazil in our other region which includes south africa canada and the middle east and in the asia pacific region primarily in china and india the united kingdom was essentially flat as the organic revenue increase in the second half of the year offset declines in the first half of 2010 this organic revenue increase in the united kingdom as well as the increase in brazil was partially attributable to growth in the consumer goods sector there was an organic revenue decrease in the continental europe region primarily in italy germany and spain which included the impact of a weakened economic climate in certain european countries

operating expenses 



salaries and related expenses 

salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs employee performance incentives including annual bonus and longterm incentive awards and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with shortterm changes in revenue levels however salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of the hiring of personnel to support revenue growth and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards additionally we may take severance actions in areas where we have or anticipate decreases in operating performance changes in our incentive awards mix can impact futureperiod expense as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year they are earned and longterm incentive awards are expensed over the performance period generally three years factors impacting longterm incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting the change in our stock price and changes to our projected results which could impact the achievement of certain performance targets

our staff cost ratio defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue decreased in 2011  to 628  from 633  in 2010  salaries and related expenses in 2011  increased by 2851  compared to 2010  primarily consisting of an organic increase of 2091  and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 749  the organic increase in salaries and related expenses of 51  was lower than our organic revenue increase of 61  due to our cost discipline during the year the organic increase was primarily attributable to increases in our workforce to support business growth resulting in an increase in base salaries benefits and temporary help of 1894 hiring began in 2010 and sequentially decreased by quarter through 2011 also contributing to the organic increase but to a lesser extent was higher incentive award expense primarily due to continued improvement in operating results in 2011 the organic increase occurred across all regions primarily in our domestic market 

our staff cost ratio decreased in 2010  to 633  from 659  in 2009  salaries and related expenses in 2010  increased by 1558  compared to 2009  primarily consisting of an organic increase of 1162  and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 326  the organic increase was due to higher temporary help of 548 incurred to support business growth also contributing to the organic increase was higher incentive award expense of 677 and to a lesser extent other discretionary bonus awards primarily due to improved operating results in 2010 this is in contrast to 2009 where we had lower incentive award expense due to lower operating performance primarily as a result of difficult economic conditions the organic increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily in our domestic market and certain international regions with improved operating results in locations where we had organic revenue decreases such as various countries in the continental europe region we had lower salaries and related expenses due to large workforce reductions taken in 2009 as well as additional actions taken in 2010 the increases in salaries and related expenses were partially offset by a decrease in severance expense of 676 compared to the prior year 

the following table details our staff cost ratio 



office and general expenses 

office and general expenses primarily include rent expense professional fees certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and depreciation and amortization costs office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements including production costs outofpocket costs such as travel for client service staff and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients production expenses can vary significantly between periods depending upon the timing of completion of certain projects where we act as principal which could impact trends between various periods in the future 



our office and general expense ratio defined as office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue decreased in 2011  to 274  from 282  in 2010  office and general expenses in 2011  increased by 866  compared to 2010  primarily consisting of an organic increase of 572  and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 343  the organic increase was primarily attributable to continued business growth in 2011 which resulted in higher production expenses related to passthrough costs for certain projects where we acted as a principal that increased in size or were new during 2011  also contributing 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  continued

to the organic increase but to a lesser extent was higher discretionary spending to support business growth 

our office and general expense ratio decreased in 2010  to 282  from 283  in 2009  office and general expenses in 2010  increased by 1374  compared to 2009  primarily consisting of an organic increase of 1106  and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 209  the organic increase was primarily due to higher production expenses related to passthrough costs for certain projects where we acted as a principal that increased in size or were new during 2010 as compared to 2009 the remainder of the organic increase was due to higher discretionary spending to support business growth as well as a foreign currency exchange translation loss of approximately 50 related to our venezuela agencies transitioning to inflationary accounting as of january 1 2010 the organic increase was partially offset by lower occupancy costs which was partly due to lease terminations we initiated in 2009 

the following table details our office and general expense ratio all other office and general expenses primarily include production expenses and to a lesser extent depreciation and amortization bad debt expense foreign currency gains losses and other expenses 



expenses and other income 



net interest expense 

for 2011  net interest expense decreased by 120  as compared to 2010  primarily due to an increase in interest income interest income increased primarily due to an increase in average cash and cash equivalent balances and an increase in average interest rates in certain countries around the world compared to the prioryear period interest expense decreased primarily due to repayment of debt obligations in 2010 partially offset by higher interest expense in certain countries outside of the united states 

for 2010  net interest expense decreased by 96  as compared to 2009  primarily due to a decrease in noncash interest expense partially offset by a decrease in interest income the reduction in noncash interest expense was due to no longer amortizing deferred warrant costs and debt issuance costs that were associated with our 7500 threeyear credit agreement dated as of june 13 2006 which expired in june 2009 interest income decreased in 2010  due to lower domestic interest rates compared to 2009

results of operations include certain items which are not directly associated with our revenueproducing operations 



sales of businesses and investments – this item primarily includes realized gains and losses relating to the sales of businesses and investments cumulative translation adjustment balances from the liquidation of entities and sales of marketable securities and investments in publicly traded and privately held companies in our rabbi trusts during 2011  we received net proceeds of 1335  from the sale of approximately half of our holdings in facebook inc the facebook transaction a costmethod investment and recorded a pretax gain of 1322  additionally during 2011  we recognized a loss relating to the sale of a business in the domestic market within our integrated agency networks ian segment during 2010  we recognized a gain relating to the sale of a business in the domestic market within our constituency management group cmg segment which was partially offset by a loss recognized relating to the sale of one our european businesses within our ian segment during 2009  we realized a gain relating to the sale of an investment in our rabbi trusts which was partially offset by losses realized from the sale of various businesses 

net loss on early extinguishment of debt  – during 2009  we recorded a net charge of 251 primarily related to the settlement of our tender offers for certain outstanding debt securities 

vendor discounts and credit adjustments – we are in the process of settling our liabilities related to vendor discounts and credits established as part of the 2004 restatement these adjustments reflect the reversal of certain of these liabilities as a result of settlements with clients or vendors or where the statute of limitations has lapsed 

income taxes 



our tax rates are affected by many factors including our worldwide earnings from various countries changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income in 2011  our effective income tax rate of 258  was positively impacted primarily from the utilization of capital losses to offset nearly all of the 1322  capital gain realized from the facebook transaction the capital gain enabled us to use capital loss carryforwards on which a 100 valuation allowance had been previously established and capital losses attributable to worthless securities in a consolidated subsidiary additionally the effective income tax rate was positively impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the effective settlement of the 20072008 irs audit cycle a lower effective income tax rate on nonus operations and the net reversal of valuation allowances primarily in europe the effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by state and local taxes and losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances the settlement of the 20072008 audit cycle resulted in no cash payment 

in 2010  our effective income tax rate of 380  was positively impacted by reversals of valuation allowances in canada and the united kingdom our effective income tax rate was negatively impacted by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and the taxation of foreign operations which included an income tax assessment in latin america during 2010  we effectively settled with the united kingdom tax authorities for the 2007 and 2008 tax years which resulted in no cash payment also in 2010  we effectively settled our new york state examination for the 19992001 tax years this settlement resulted in a cash payment of 117 consisting of 54 of tax and 63 of interest which was previously reserved 

in 2009  our effective income tax rate of 388  was positively impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits net which includes the recognition of tax benefits on partially worthless securities of 107 our effective income tax

rate was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances the establishment of valuation allowances in the asia pacific region and the writeoff of deferred tax assets related to restricted stock during 2009  we finalized our proceedings with the irs appeals division for the 19972002 and 20032004 audit cycles we also finalized our irs examination for the 20052006 audit cycle as a result we recognized previously unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of 501 related to various items of income and expense primarily attributable to transfer pricing adjustments and adjustments relating to the 2004 restatement

revenue 



during 2011  ian revenue increased by 4234  compared to 2010  primarily consisting of an organic revenue increase of 2918  and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 1069  the increase in revenue at our ian segment represented approximately 74  of the total organic revenue increase the organic revenue increase was primarily attributable to net higher spending from existing clients in all major client sectors across our advertising and media businesses and in nearly all geographic regions led by the domestic market the sectors which primarily contributed to the organic revenue increase were technology and telecom and to a lesser extent auto and transportation the international organic increase occurred predominantly in the latin america region primarily in brazil and in the asia pacific region primarily in india and china the international organic revenue increase was partially offset by an organic revenue decrease in the continental europe region which was impacted by a challenging economic climate in the region

in the latin america region mostly in brazil and in our other region which includes south africa canada and the middle east the international organic revenue increase was partially offset by organic decreases in the continental europe region primarily in italy germany and spain which included the effect of a weakened economic climate in certain european countries 

segment operating income 



  

operating income increased during 2011  when compared to 2010  due to an increase in revenue of 4234  partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of 2387 and office and general expenses of 735 the increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily attributable to increases in our workforce to support business growth which resulted in an increase in base salaries benefits and temporary help across nearly all agencies within ian hiring began in 2010 and sequentially decreased by quarter through 2011 office and general expenses increased primarily due to an increase in occupancy costs and to a lesser extent higher discretionary spending and higher production expenses due to business growth

cmg 

revenue 



during 2011  cmg revenue increased by 839  compared to 2010  consisting of an organic revenue increase of 1019  and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 153  partially offset by the effect of net divestitures of 333  the organic revenue increase was primarily due to higher spending from existing clients and net client wins which occurred in most disciplines primarily in our public relations and events marketing businesses in both our domestic and international markets the international organic increase was most significant in the asia pacific region primarily in china and australia and in the united kingdom the organic revenue increase includes higher revenue related to certain projects where we act as principal primarily in our events marketing business the reduction in revenue due to net divestitures primarily relates to the sale of a business in our domestic market in the fourth quarter of 2010 



during 2010  cmg revenue increased by 932  compared to 2009  primarily due to an organic revenue increase of 879  the organic revenue increase was due to net client wins and higher spending from existing clients in all major disciplines primarily in our events marketing and public relations businesses and predominantly in the domestic market these increases include the

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow overview 

the following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity capital resources and uses of capital 





   



operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities  during 2011  was 2735  which is a decrease of 5438  as compared to 2010  primarily as a result of a use of cash from working capital in 2011 of 3594  as compared to a generation in 2010 of 2632  due to the seasonality of our business we typically generate cash from working capital in the second half of a year and use cash from working capital in the first half of a year with the largest impacts in the first and fourth quarters in the fourth quarter of 2010 we had significant cash generation from working capital primarily due to a high rate of growth in our media businesses which resulted in comparable working capital usage in the first quarter of 2011 our net working capital use in 2011  was also impacted by slower growth in those same businesses compared to the prior year 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2010 was 8173 which was an improvement of 2765 as compared to 2009 as a result of an increase in net income of 1378 as well as an improvement in working capital of 1643 the increased generation of working capital in 2010 was primarily attributable to business growth most notably at our media businesses 

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients and accounts payable our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers 

our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments for example while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during 2011  primarily relates to payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by the net proceeds of 1335  received from the facebook transaction capital expenditures of 1403  relate primarily to computer software and hardware and leasehold improvements capital expenditures increased in 2011  compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in leasehold improvements made during the year payments for acquisitions of 631

relate to new acquisitions and deferred payments on prior acquisitions 

net cash used in investing activities during 2010  primarily reflects payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions capital expenditures of 963  relate to leasehold improvements computer hardware and furniture and fixtures payments for acquisitions of 619  relate to new acquisitions primarily dlkw as well as deferred payments on prior acquisitions 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during 2011  primarily relates to the repurchase of 417  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of 4008  including fees additionally net cash used in financing activities includes dividend payments of 1111  on our common stock and acquisitionrelated payments of 715  primarily related to transactions with consolidated subsidiaries where we have increased our ownership interests 

net cash used in financing activities during 2010  includes the repurchase of a portion of our series b preferred stock for 2659  in cash payments of longterm debt of 2173  primarily as a result of the maturity of our floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2010 acquisitionrelated payments of 295  primarily related to transactions with consolidated subsidiaries where we increased our ownership interests distributions to noncontrolling interests of 215  and dividend payments of 196  on our series b preferred stock 

foreign exchange rate changes 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in a decrease of 467  in 2011  the decrease was a result of the us dollar being stronger than several foreign currencies including the euro and brazilian real as of december 31 2011  compared to december 31 2010  

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in an increase of 194  in 2010  the increase was a result of the us dollar being weaker than several foreign currencies partially offset by the us dollar being stronger than the euro as of december 31 2010  compared to december 31 2009  

  

liquidity outlook 

we expect our cash flow from operations cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months we also have a committed corporate credit facility available to support our operating needs we continue to maintain a conservative approach to liquidity with flexibility over significant uses of cash including our capital expenditures cash used for new acquisitions our common stock repurchase program and our common stock dividends 

from time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional financing or otherwise improve our liquidity profile enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors which include those specific to us such as our credit rating and those related to the financial markets such as the amount or terms of available credit there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

funding requirements 

our most significant funding requirements include our operations noncancelable operating lease obligations capital expenditures acquisitions dividends taxes debt service and contributions to pension and postretirement plans additionally we may be required to make payments to minority shareholders in certain subsidiaries if they exercise their options arising from prior acquisitions to sell us their interests notable funding requirements include

the following summarizes our estimated contractual cash obligations and commitments as of december 31 2011  and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 





 

share repurchase program 

in february 2011 our board authorized a program to repurchase from time to time up to 3000  of our common stock in august 2011 our board authorized an increase in the amount available under our share repurchase program up to 4500  of our common stock on february 24 2012 we announced that our board had approved a new share repurchase program to repurchase from time to time up to 3000 of our common stock the new authorization is in addition to any amounts remaining available for repurchase under the program we announced in 2011 we may effect repurchases under the share repurchase programs through open market purchases trading plans established in accordance with sec rules derivative transactions or other means we expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in future periods although the timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on market conditions and our other funding requirements the share repurchase programs have no expiration date

financing and sources of funds 

substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries below is a summary of our sources of liquidity 





  

 

credit facilities 

we maintain a committed corporate credit facility to increase our financial flexibility in may 2011  we entered into an amendment and restatement of our credit agreement originally dated as of july 18 2008  the “credit agreement” increasing the commitments of the lenders to 10000  from 6500  and extending the credit agreements expiration to may 31 2016  additionally the amendments modified our financial covenants and provided additional flexibility with respect to or eliminated certain covenants such as restrictions on acquisitions capital expenditures and restricted payments in addition the cost structure was reduced the credit agreement is a revolving facility under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 10000  or the equivalent in other currencies the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase subject to a sublimit on letters of credit of 2000  or the equivalent in other currencies our obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured we have not drawn on any of our corporate credit facilities since 2003 although we use them for letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries 

the credit agreement includes covenants that among other things limit our liens and the liens of our consolidated subsidiaries and limit subsidiary debt as well as financial covenants the financial covenants in the credit agreement require that we maintain as of the end of each fiscal quarter certain financial measures for the four quarters then ended the table below sets forth the financial covenants in effect as of december 31 2011  





  

 as of december 31 2011  we were in compliance with all of our covenants in the credit agreement if we were unable to comply with our covenants in the future we would seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver if we were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver the credit facility could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal in addition under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility 

we also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates we use our uncommitted credit lines for working capital needs at some of our operations outside the united states we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations the weightedaverage interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted credit facilities as of december 31 2011  and 2010  was approximately 50

capped call 

in november 2010 we purchased capped call options to hedge the risk of price appreciation on the shares of our common stock into which our 475  notes are convertible 

the strike price and cap price related to the capped call options as of december 31 2011  and 2010  are listed below 



during 2011  the strike price and cap price related to the capped call options were adjusted due to the payment of cash dividends on our common stock as of december 31 2011  the options give us the right to purchase up to 165  shares of our common stock at the strike price except that the economic value of the net proceeds of exercising the options will not exceed the difference between the strike price and the cap price subject to certain limitations we may elect settlement of the options to occur in cash or in shares the options will expire on april 2 2013  our capped call transaction meets the definition of an offbalance sheet arrangement per regulation sk item 303a4 

investments 

from time to time we make investments in privately held companies that we believe may be of strategic importance to the advertising and marketing sectors these investments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at cost certain of these investments the most significant of which is in facebook have significantly appreciated compared to their cost but there can be no assurance as to the terms on which we would be able to dispose of any such investments 

in august 2011 we sold approximately half of our holdings in facebook and received net proceeds of 1335  which was classified within the investing section of our consolidated statements of cash flows as of december 31 2011 our remaining holdings in facebook are recorded at cost on our consolidated balance sheets although we believe the value of our holdings has significantly appreciated as evidenced by the sales price of the portion of our investment sold in august 

cash pooling 

we aggregate our net domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the united states we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several ipg agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of bank overdrafts under all of our pooling arrangements and as of december 31 2011  and 2010  the amount netted were 11066  and 9161  respectively 

debt credit ratings 

our longterm debt credit ratings as of february 15 2012  are listed below 



we are investmentgrade rated by both moodys investor services moodys and fitch ratings the most recent update to our credit ratings occurred in june 2011 when moodys upgraded our rating from ba2 to baa3  and changed our outlook from positive to stable in may 2011 standard and poor’s upgraded our credit rating from bb to bb  and changed our outlook from positive to stable in october 2010 fitch ratings upgraded our rating from bb to bbb  and changed our outlook from positive to stable a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity either adverse or favorable including among other things because they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise for example our credit agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

amounts in millions 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items from time to time we use derivative instruments pursuant to established guidelines and policies to manage some portion of these risks derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rates 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value of our debt obligations because the majority of our debt approximately 91  and 93  as of december 31 2011  and 2010  respectively bears interest at fixed rates we do have debt with variable interest rates but a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a 10 change in interest rates is summarized below 



we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate debt during 2011  we entered into and exited interest rate swaps related to our 625 senior unsecured notes due 2014 and do not have any such swaps outstanding as of december 31 2011  

we had 23156  of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2011  that we generally invest in conservative shortterm investmentgrade securities the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements during 2011  and 2010  we had interest income of 378  and 287  respectively based on our 2011  results a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately 230  assuming that all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were affected in the same manner and balances remain constant from yearend 2011  levels 

foreign currency rates 

we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2011  were the australian dollar brazilian real euro japanese yen and pound sterling based on 2011  exchange rates and operating results if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10 we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase between 3  and 5  assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2011  current levels 

the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency mitigating transaction risk however certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency the us dollar and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary our venezuela agencies transitioned to inflationary accounting on january 1 2010 and as a result we recorded a foreign exchange translation loss of approximately 50 in 2010  this charge was recorded in office and general expenses within the consolidated 

statements of operations in 2010  we remeasured our local nonmonetary transactions assets and liabilities using the exchange rate of 43 venezuelan bolivares fuertes per us dollar subsequent to the currency remeasurement this devaluation did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements as we do not have significant operations in venezuela 

credit and market risks 

balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients we invest our excess cash in investmentgrade shortterm securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 

our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods

 the market for our digital media services continue to evolve rapidly as such strong multichannel talent is vital to our longterm success as a marketing partner to our clients in order to grow with our clients we have focused our investment in digital talent professional training and technology throughout the organization in recent years this reflects our belief that digital marketing should not be treated as a standalone function but instead should be integrated within all of our companies recruiting and developing digitally conversant talent at all our agencies and in all marketing disciplines is an area where we continue to invest 

to meet these changing needs of the marketplace we have at times also acquired or built specialty digital assets such as reprise media search engine marketing huge ecommerce solutions and the interpublic emerging media lab we have continued to invest in existing digital assets such as rga a digital agency and industry leader in the development of awardwinning interactive campaigns for global clients these specialty assets have unique capabilities and service their own client rosters while also serving as key digital partners to many of the agencies within ipg 

we continue to evaluate strategic opportunities to invest and grow in fastgrowth geographic regions for example in 2010 we acquired cubocc a new media and digital marketing services company in brazil in recent years we have made additional investments in india and brazil further strengthening our leadership position in these highgrowth developing markets we also hold a majority stake in the middle east communication networks “mcn” which we believe is the regions premier marketing services management company mcn is headquartered in dubai with 60 offices across 14 countries our partner in russia is an acknowledged advertising leader in that country in china where we operate with all of our global networks and across the full spectrum of marketing services we continue to invest behind our companies 

our longterm financial goals include maintaining organic revenue growth at competitive levels while expanding our operating margin accordingly we remain focused on meeting the evolving needs of our clients while carefully managing our cost structure we continually seek greater efficiency in the delivery of our services focusing on more effective resource utilization including the productivity of our employees real estate and information technology the improvements we have made in our financial reporting and business information systems during recent years provide us with more timely and actionable insights from our global operations while our strong balance sheet and liquidity position provide us with a solid financial foundation and financial flexibility 

during 2010 we have seen our clients renew their focus on investing in marketing to protect market share and enhance brand value we feel our network of companies delivers a high level of integrated modern marketing solutions which clients are looking for today in 2010 ipg agencies were recognized with many of the industry’s most coveted honors across many advertising and marketing disciplines our agencies are invited to compete for most major new business opportunities and won a number of the year’s biggest and most competitive new business assignments 

in summary we believe that our strategy and execution position us to be fully competitive in key growth areas such as digital services and emerging markets with the talent and creativity to thrive in a contentdriven media world and to meet our financial goals and deliver longterm shareholder value

 for further information regarding revenues and longlived assets on a geographical basis for each of the last three years see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

sources of revenue 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising marketing and communications programs in various media around the world our revenue is directly dependent upon our ability to win new clients and the 

  

advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 90 days 

revenues for the creation planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative or quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate the difference is the commission that we earn which is either retained in total or shared with the client depending on the nature of the services agreement 

we also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion event marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges 

our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter fee revenue recognized on a completed contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at december 31 

 

 see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition accounting policies 

clients 

our large and diverse client base includes many of the leading companies and brands throughout the world our holding company structure allows us to work with clients within the same business sector through our different agencies as well as maintain a diversified client base by sector in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 24 of revenue in 2010 and 2009 our largest client accounted for approximately 5 and 4 of revenue for 2010 and 2009 respectively based on revenue for the year ended december 31 2010 our largest clients in alphabetical order were general motors johnson  johnson microsoft unilever and verizon we represent several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency systems representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time 

we operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry our operating companies compete against other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies to win new clients and maintain existing client relationships 

  

personnel 

as of december 31 2010 we employed approximately 41000 people of whom approximately 18000 were employed in the us because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success we conduct extensive employee training and development throughout our agencies and benchmark our compensation programs against those of our industry for their competitiveness and effectiveness in recruitment and retention there is keen competition for qualified employees

 item 1a risk factors tableend we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial could also have a negative impact on our business operations or financial condition see also “statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure” 

 

 the marketing communications business is highly competitive our agencies and media services compete with other agencies and with other providers of creative marketing or media services to maintain existing client relationships and to win new business our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets new market participants include database marketing and modeling companies telemarketers and internet companies 

the client’s perception of the quality of our agencies’ creative work our reputation and our agencies’ reputations are important factors that affect our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis is also an important competitive consideration on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 24 of revenue in 2010 a substantial decline in a large client’s advertising and marketing spending or the loss of a significant part of its business could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 

our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

  

 while we have seen economic recovery in many of our key markets in 2010 areas of uncertainty about the prospects for continued improvements in the global economy and a degree of caution on the part of some marketers continue to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing services the marketing services industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downtown and can recover more slowly than the economy generally in the past some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses this pattern may recur in the future a decrease in our revenue could pose a challenge to our cash generation from operations 

 

 our employees including creative digital research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most valuable assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and could be adversely affected by our financial or market performance in addition the advertising and marketing services industry is characterized by a high degree of employee mobility if we were to fail to attract key personnel or lose them to competitors or clients our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

 we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business unfavorable economic and financial conditions could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and writeoffs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients and if these effects were severe the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity for a description of our client base see “clients” in item 1 business 

 

 we maintain a committed credit facility to increase our financial flexibility as amended and restated as of april 23 2010 the “credit agreement” the credit agreement contains financial covenants and events like a material economic downturn could adversely affect our ability to comply with them for example compliance with the financial covenants would be more difficult to achieve if we were to experience substantially lower revenues a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges if we were unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement we could be required to seek further amendments or waivers and our costs under the credit agreement could increase if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver the credit agreement could be terminated furthermore the credit agreement includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions and if any of them were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institution’s commitment the availability of credit under that agreement would be correspondingly reduced if credit under the credit agreement were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity could be adversely affected 

if our business is significantly adversely affected by difficult economic conditions adverse conditions in the credit markets unavailability of credit or otherwise it could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our needs there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook see “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

 from time to time we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent 

  

risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them similarly we may not realize the intended advantages of past or future investments or acquisitions of businesses because we may incorrectly evaluate risks and benefits from these transactions or have unforeseen difficulties integrating them into our organization see “statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure” 

 

 we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and fixed assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication that they are impaired or not realizable if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance 

as of december 31 2010 we have substantial amounts of longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet including approximately 34 billion of goodwill future events including our financial performance market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies loss of a significant client’s business or strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments may have become impaired for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets and our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations any significant impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized 

 

 we are a global business operations outside the united states represent a significant portion of our revenues approximately 43 in 2010 these operations are exposed to risks that include local legislation currency variation exchange control restrictions and difficult local political or economic conditions in developing countries or regions we may face further risks such as slower receipt of payments nationalization social and economic instability currency repatriation restrictions and undeveloped or inconsistently enforced commercial laws these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries in addition because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar chinese yuan renminbi euro japanese yen and pound sterling fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results 

 

 we can be adversely affected if our credit ratings are downgraded or if they are significantly weaker than those of our competitors because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness including covenants and interest rates our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

 

 our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign advertisers and consumer groups may challenge advertising through legislation regulation judicial actions or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare our business is also subject to specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements applicable to advertising for certain products legislators agencies and other governmental units may continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products such as alcohol or tobacco and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may hinder our ability to accomplish our clients’ goals and have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently on our revenues furthermore we could suffer reputational risk as a result of governmental or legal action or from undertaking controversial work that may be challenged by consumer groups

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” is intended to help you understand the interpublic group of companies inc and its subsidiaries “ipg” “we” “us” or “our” mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this report our mda includes the following sections 

executive summary provides a discussion about factors influencing our business and an overview of our results of operations and liquidity 

critical accounting estimates provides a discussion of our accounting policies that require critical judgment assumptions and estimates 

results of operations provides an analysis of the consolidated and segment results of operations for 2010 compared to 2009 and 2009 compared to 2008

recent accounting standards by reference to note 16 to the consolidated financial statements provides a discussion of certain accounting standards that have been adopted during 2010 and certain accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement and may be applicable to our future operations 

executive summary 

during 2010 we have seen economic recovery in various key markets and an increase in spending from many of our clients in multiple business sectors as a result we have experienced growth across our marketing disciplines where we see strategic opportunity we are continuing to invest in talent to support growth we have achieved improved operating leverage in 2010 as a result of higher revenues while maintaining our ongoing cost discipline a degree of caution on the part of marketers continues to have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing services particularly in light of uncertainty about the prospects for continued improvements in the global economy however we continue to derive benefits from our diversified client base global footprint and the broad range and strength of our professional offerings as a result we believe we are wellpositioned to benefit from a renewed focus on growth the following tables present a summary of financial performance for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared with the same periods in 2009 and 2008 

 

   

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

  

when we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the remainder we call organic change which indicates how our underlying business performed the performance metrics that we use to analyze our results include the organic change in revenue salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses and the components of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total consolidated revenue additionally in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by business sector where we focus on our top 100 clients which typically constitutes approximately 5560 of our consolidated revenues we also analyze revenue by geographic region 

the change in our operating performance attributable to foreign currency rates is determined by converting the priorperiod reported results using the current period exchange rates and comparing these priorperiod adjusted amounts to the priorperiod reported results although the us dollar is our reporting currency a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies therefore our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this translation risk as a result both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar affect our consolidated results of operations and the magnitude of the foreign currency impact on us related to each geographic region depends on the significance and operating performance of the region the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2010 include the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar and euro during 2010 the us dollar weakened against several foreign currencies as compared to the prioryear period which had a net positive impact on our 2010 consolidated results of operations this effect was partially offset as the us dollar strengthened against the euro and pound sterling during 2010 for 2010 foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net increases of approximately 1 in revenues salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses which contributed on a net basis to an increase in operating income of approximately 3 compared to the prioryear period for 2009 foreign currency fluctuations resulted in net decreases of approximately 4 in revenues and operating expenses which contributed to a net decrease in operating income of approximately 4 compared to the prioryear period 

for purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred during the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offerings and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan for 2010 and 2009 the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue and operating expenses compared to the respective prioryear period for additional information on our acquisitions see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our consolidated financial statements management has discussed with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising marketing and communications programs in various media around the world most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

  

are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies in arranging for such services it is possible that we will enter into global regional and local agreements agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements 

revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the price is fixed or determinable iii collectability is reasonably assured and iv services have been performed depending on the terms of a client contract fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways proportional performance straightline or monthly basis or completed contract 

depending on the terms of the client contract revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed commissions performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both qualitative and quantitative goals performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client the classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments if the judgments change there can be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods incremental direct costs incurred related to contracts where revenue is accounted for on a completed contract basis are generally expensed as incurred 

substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less passthrough expenses charged to a client in most cases the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our consolidated financial statements because of various passthrough expenses such as production and media costs we assess whether our agency or the thirdparty supplier is the primary obligor and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment in addition we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor because we operate broadly as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting accordingly we generally record revenue net of passthrough charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business in those businesses primarily sales promotion and event sports and entertainment marketing where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as office and general expenses revenue is generally reported net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenueproducing transactions 

the determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments if we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our financial performance if it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin 

we receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that based on the terms of our contracts and local law are either remitted to our clients or retained by us if amounts are to be passed through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or if retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned income or expense may also be realized in connection with settling vendor discount or credit liabilities that were established as part of the restatement we presented in our 2004 annual report on form 10k the “2004 restatement” in these situations and given the historical nature of these liabilities we have recorded such items as other income or expense as we do not consider these to be part of current operating results

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes 

we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets which is primarily dependent on future earnings a valuation allowance shall be recognized when based on available evidence it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods in circumstances where there is significant negative evidence establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance conversely a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance further in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings in 2010 and 2008 we recorded a net reversal of valuation allowances of 24 and 480 respectively in 2009 we recorded a net charge for the establishment of valuation allowances of 124 

the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally guidance is provided for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments we evaluate our tax positions using a “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we have accounted for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method beginning in 2009 while we utilized the purchase accounting method in prior years both accounting methods require us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of october 1 st each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we have 11 reporting units that were subject to the 2010 annual impairment testing our reporting unit structure changed from 2009 due to the movement of four reporting units into other existing reporting units based on operational decisions by management during 2010 our annual impairment reviews as of october 1 2010 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units 

we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets these assets

are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

the authoritative guidance for goodwill specifies a twostep process for goodwill impairment testing and measuring the magnitude of any impairment the first step of the impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill the sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the first step of the impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

the fair value of a reporting unit for 2010 and 2009 was estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data we primarily applied an equal weighting to the income and market approach for our analysis for the income approach we used projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth profit margins terminal value growth rates capital expenditures projections assumed tax rates discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management for the market approach we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparablecompany market multiples 

these estimates and assumptions vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit the discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit for 2010 the discount rates we used for our reporting units were between 115 and 130 the terminal value growth rates for our reporting units were between 30 and 35 the terminal value growth rates represent the expected longterm growth rate for the advertising and marketing services industry incorporating the type of services the reporting unit provides and the global economy for 2010 the revenue growth rates for our reporting units used in our analysis were generally between 50 and 60 factors influencing the revenue growth rates include the nature of the services the reporting unit provides for its clients the geographic locations in which the reporting unit conducts business and the maturity of the reporting unit we believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period actual results of operations cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation and it is possible that differences and changes could be material a deterioration in profitability adverse market conditions significant client losses changes in spending levels of our existing clients or a different economic outlook than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit where the low end of the range reduces growth rates by 05 and increases discount rates by 05 and the high end of the range increases growth rates by 05 and decreases discount rates by 05 we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the impairment test

the following table shows the number of reporting units we tested in our 2010 and 2009 annual impairment reviews and the related goodwill value associated with the reporting units at the low end average and high end of the valuation range for a fair values exceeding carrying values by less than 10 b fair values exceeding carrying values between 10 and 20 c fair values exceeding carrying values by more than 20 and d carrying values that exceed fair value 

 

  

   the table above displays the information related to our 2010 and 2009 annual impairment tests we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the impairment test in 2010 our results for the comparison between carrying value and fair value at the average fair value indicated that there were no reporting units whose carrying values exceeded their respective fair value for 2010 using the average fair value there was one reporting unit whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by less than 10 and there was 1500 of goodwill associated with this reporting unit additionally we performed a sensitivity analysis and reviewed the carrying values compared to the low and high end of the valuation range using the low end of the valuation range there were no reporting units whose carrying values exceeded their respective fair values there were two reporting units whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10 and there was 5892 of goodwill associated with these reporting units using the high end of the valuation range there were no reporting units whose carrying values exceeded their respective fair values or whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10 

in 2009 our results for the comparison between carrying value and fair value at the average fair value indicated that one reporting unit’s carrying value exceeded its fair value and there was 61 of goodwill associated with that reporting unit as

a result we were required to perform the second step of the impairment test under the second step the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was allocated among its assets and liabilities in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill we did not record an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2009 as we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was greater than the carrying value for this reporting unit additionally no carrying value adjustment was made to the intangible assets for this reporting unit as the estimated cash flows were greater than the carrying value of these assets on an undiscounted basis for 2009 using the average fair value there were six reporting units whose fair value exceeded their carrying value by less than 10 and there was 6153 of goodwill associated with these reporting units using the low end of the valuation range the carrying values for five reporting units exceeded their respective fair values and there was 3418 of goodwill associated with these reporting units that would be subject to the second step of a goodwill impairment review there were three reporting units whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10 and there was 7150 of goodwill associated with these reporting units using the high end of the valuation range there were no reporting units whose carrying values exceeded their respective fair values there were five reporting units whose fair values exceeded their carrying values by less than 10 and there was 4304 of goodwill associated with these reporting units 

pension and postretirement benefits 

we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate is a significant assumption that impacts our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations at december 31 2009 we determined our discount rates based on a bondyield curve approach which uses discount rate models that apply a consistent methodology to constructing a universe of highquality aarated corporate bonds utilizing each country’s bond universe aa spot rate yield curves are derived and the plans’ cash flows are applied to those spot rate yield curves to calculate a discount rate in countries where markets for highquality longterm aa corporate bonds are not well developed a portfolio of longterm government bonds is used as a basis to develop hypothetical corporate bond yields which serve as a basis to derive the discount rate weightedaverage discount rates of 551 550 and 550 were used in the calculation of 2010 net pension and postretirement benefit costs for the domestic pension plan significant foreign pension plans and the postretirement plan respectively a lower discount rate would increase our net pension and postretirement benefit costs a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2010 net pension and postretirement cost by approximately 20 and 10 respectively 

on december 31 2010 we changed from using a bondyield curve approach as described above to a bond selectionsettlement approach for our domestic pension and postretirement plans as well as for our foreign pension plans located in the united kingdom we believe the new approach provides a better estimate of the discount rate because it reflects the approach the company would use if actually acquiring a portfolio of bonds to immunize or effectively settle our obligation using the bond selectionsettlement approach we determine the discount rate by selecting a portfolio of aarated corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments for our domestic plans this change in our discount rate selection process resulted in a decrease in our pension and postretirement obligation of 86 and an increase in other comprehensive income of 50 net of tax for our foreign plans this change resulted in a decrease of 183 to our pension obligation and an increase in other comprehensive income of 183 net of tax this change did not impact our pension and postretirement benefit costs for 2010 we do not expect that this change will have a significant impact to our consolidated results of operations in future years 

at december 31 2010 we used a discount rate of 550 for the domestic pension and postretirement plans and a weightedaverage discount rate of 545 for our significant foreign pension plans to measure our benefit obligations a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the december 31 2010 benefit obligation by approximately 200 and 210 respectively

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year our expected rate of return considers asset class index returns over various market and economic conditions current and expected market conditions risk premiums associated with asset classes and longterm inflation rates we determine both a shortterm and longterm view and then select a longterm rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities 

net pension costs included in our 2010 consolidated results of operations were calculated using weightedaverage expected rates of return of 749 and 584 for the domestic and foreign pension plans respectively for 2011 we plan to use an expected rate of return of 750 for the domestic pension plan and a weightedaverage rate of return of 588 for the foreign pension plans changes in the rates are typically due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held a lower expected rate of return would increase our net pension cost a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2010 net pension cost by approximately 10 

results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 

revenue 

our revenue is directly dependent upon our ability to win new clients and the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our existing clients most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at year end on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter additionally revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects in the events marketing business as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete we generally act as principal for these projects and as such record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as passthrough costs in office and general expenses

during 2010 our revenue increased by 5043 or 84 compared to 2009 primarily consisting of an organic revenue increase of 4240 or 70 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 633 our organic increase was primarily attributable to higher spending from existing clients and net client wins in nearly all sectors of our business and throughout most geographic regions the sectors which contributed the most to the organic revenue increase were auto and transportation financial services and health and personal care the auto and transportation financial services and technology and telecom sectors were the primary sectors that were negatively impacted by the global recession in 2009 although our technology and telecom sector experienced a slight organic revenue decrease for the full year 2010 this sector had an organic revenue increase in the second half of 2010 as the impact of certain lost assignments in the prior year diminished regionally the largest organic revenue increase was in our domestic market primarily related to the factors noted above our international organic revenue increase was most notably in the latin america region primarily in brazil in our other region which includes south africa canada and the middle east and in the asia pacific region primarily in china and india the united kingdom was essentially flat as the organic revenue increase in the second half of the year offset declines in the first half of 2010 this organic revenue increase in the united kingdom as well as the increase in brazil was partially attributable to growth in the packaged goods sector there was an organic revenue decrease in the continental europe region primarily in italy germany and spain which includes the impact of a continued weakened economic climate in certain european countries 

 

 during 2009 our revenue decreased by 9351 or 134 compared to 2008 primarily consisting of an organic revenue decrease of 7526 or 108 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 2516 our organic decrease was primarily attributable to spending declines and lost assignments as a result of the negative impact of global economic conditions on nearly all sectors of our business throughout all geographic regions the sectors that primarily contributed to the organic revenue decrease were technology and telecom auto and transportation and financial services two other significant sectors health and personal care and food and beverage were relatively stable in 2009 as they only had slight organic revenue decreases additionally a small percentage of our organic revenue decrease was related to prioryear project assignments in our events marketing discipline that due to economic conditions did not recur or were substantially curtailed these projects are reflected in various sectors and geographic regions

salaries and related expenses 

salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs employee performance incentives including annual bonus and longterm incentive awards and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with shortterm changes in revenue levels however salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of the hiring of personnel to support revenue growth and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards additionally we may take severance actions in areas where we have decreases in operating performance changes in our incentive awards mix can impact futureperiod expense as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year they are earned and longterm incentive awards are expensed over the performance period generally three years factors impacting longterm incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting the change in our stock price and changes to our projected results which could impact the achievement of certain performance targets 

 

 salaries and related expenses in 2010 increased by 1558 compared to 2009 primarily consisting of an organic increase of 1162 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 326 salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue decreased to 630 in 2010 from 657 in the prior year the organic increase was due to higher temporary help of 548 incurred to support business growth organic revenue increase of 4240 we had higher incentive award expense of 677 and to a lesser extent other discretionary bonus awards primarily due to improved operating results in 2010 this is in contrast to the prior year where we had lower incentive award expense due to lower operating performance primarily as a result of difficult economic conditions the organic increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily in our domestic market and certain international regions with improved operating results in locations where we had organic revenue decreases such as various countries in the continental europe region we had lower salaries and related expenses due to large workforce reductions taken in 2009 as well as additional actions taken in 2010 the increases in salaries and related expenses were partially offset by a decrease in severance expense of 676 compared to the prior year 

salaries and related expenses in 2009 decreased by 3814 compared to 2008 primarily consisting of an organic decrease of 2792 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 1500 salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue increased to 657 in 2009 from 624 in the prior year the organic improvement was due to lower base salaries and benefits of 2215 and lower temporary help of 452 primarily related to work force reductions across all networks during 2009 to respond to the difficult economic conditions our work force reductions resulted in an organic increase in severance charges of 799 in 2009 when compared to the prior year primarily related to our advertising and media businesses in the integrated agency networks “ian” segment predominantly in the us and continental europe regions due to severance actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 through 2009 we reduced our workforce by approximately 14 the organic decrease also included a reduction in incentive award expense of 559 resulting from lower annual bonus awards due to lower operating results and lower longterm incentive award expense attributable to an increase in our forfeiture rate and changes in our assumptions on achieving certain performance targets these reductions were partially offset by higher expense due to increases in our stock price in 2009 as compared to 2008 

the following table details our salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue

our staff cost ratio defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue decreased in 2010 to 630 from 657 in 2009 primarily driven by higher revenues and to a lesser extent lower severance expense partially offset by an increase in incentive expense and temporary help our staff cost ratio increased in 2009 to 657 from 624 in 2008 primarily driven by lower revenues and increased severance expense partially offset by lower base salaries benefits temporary help and incentive award expense 

office and general expenses 

office and general expenses primarily include rent expense professional fees certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and depreciation and amortization costs office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements including production costs outofpocket costs such as travel for client service staff and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients production expenses can vary significantly between periods depending upon the timing of completion of certain projects where we act as principal which could impact trends between various periods in the future 

 

 office and general expenses in 2010 increased by 1418 compared to 2009 primarily consisting of an organic increase of 1150 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 209 the primary driver for the organic increase was higher production expenses related to passthrough costs for certain projects where we acted as a principal that increased in size or were new during 2010 as compared to the prior year the remainder of the organic increase was due to higher discretionary spending to support business growth as well as a foreign currency exchange translation loss of approximately 50 related to our venezuela agencies transitioning to inflationary accounting as of january 1 2010 the organic increase was partially offset by lower occupancy costs which was partly due to lease terminations we initiated in 2009 

office and general expenses in 2009 decreased by 2928 compared to 2008 primarily consisting of an organic decrease of 2385 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 792 the organic improvement was largely due to our cost containment efforts which resulted in lower discretionary spending additionally approximately onethird of the organic decline was attributable to lower production expenses related to passthrough costs for certain projects where we acted as principal that did not recur or decreased in size during 2009 these reductions were partially offset by a benefit from favorable foreign currency changes in 2008 on certain balance sheet items that did not recur in 2009 and to a lesser extent higher rent charges in 2009 due to lease terminations and other exit costs 

the following table details our office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue all other office and general expenses primarily include production expenses and to a lesser extent depreciation and amortization bad debt expense foreign currency gains losses and other expenses 

 

 our office and general expense ratio defined as office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue remained unchanged in 2010 at 285 when compared to 2009 during 2010 our office and general expense ratio

was benefited by higher revenues offset by higher production expenses our office and general expense ratio decreased in 2009 to 285 from 289 in 2008 primarily driven by the major expense categories that had reductions listed above partially offset by lower revenue 

restructuring and other reorganizationrelated charges net 

the components of restructuring and other reorganizationrelated charges net is listed below 

 

 restructuring charges reversals net relate to the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs and a restructuring program entered into at lowe during the third quarter of 2007 included in these net charges reversals are adjustments primarily resulting from changes in management’s estimates relating to sublease rental income assumptions prior severance and termination related actions and accelerated leasehold amortization 

other reorganizationrelated charges net were separated from the rest of our operating expenses within the consolidated statements of operations because they did not result from charges that occurred in the normal course of business these charges primarily relate to the integration of our recent acquisition of delaney lund knox warren “dlkw” into our lowe london operations in 2010 the alignment of deutsch and lowe in 2009 and the realignment of our media businesses into a management entity called mediabrands in 2008 charges relate to severance and termination costs and lease termination and other exit costs for these activities the actions associated with the integration of dlkw the alignment of deutsch and lowe and the establishment of mediabrands are complete as a result of the alignment of dlkw into our lowe london operations we believe lowe is strengthened by the addition of a premier fullservice communications agency in its london operations and dlkw benefits from the multinational reach of lowe the combined agencies called dlkw lowe serve as the united kingdom hub for lowe and partners worldwide 

expenses and other income 

 

 net interest expense 

for 2010 net interest expense decreased by 96 as compared to 2009 primarily due to a decrease in noncash interest expense partially offset by a decrease in interest income the reduction in noncash interest expense was due to no longer

amortizing deferred warrant costs and debt issuance costs that were associated with our 7500 threeyear credit agreement dated as of june 13 2006 the “2006 credit agreement” which expired in june 2009 interest income decreased in 2010 due to lower domestic interest rates compared to 2009 

for 2009 cash interest expense largely related to our shortterm obligations and interest income both decreased as compared to 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates mostly in the united kingdom continental europe and to a lesser extent the united states the majority of the change in noncash interest expense resulted from a decline in amortization of deferred warrant costs and debt issuance costs in connection with the expiration of our 2006 credit agreement the decrease in noncash interest expense was partially offset by changes in the value of obligations to purchase noncontrolling equity shares of consolidated subsidiaries the value of these obligations may fluctuate depending on projected future operating performance of these subsidiaries 

other income net 

results of operations include certain items which are not directly associated with our revenueproducing operations 

 

 net loss on early extinguishment of debt – during 2009 we recorded a net charge of 251 primarily related to the settlement of our tender offers for our 540 senior unsecured notes due 2009 the “2009 notes” our 725 senior unsecured notes due 2011 the “2011 notes” and our floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2010 the “2010 notes” 

sales of businesses and investments – this item primarily includes realized gains and losses relating to the sales of businesses cumulative translation adjustment balances from the liquidation of entities and sales of marketable securities and investments in publicly traded and privately held companies in our rabbi trusts during 2010 we recognized a gain relating to the sale of a business in the domestic market within our constituency management group “cmg” segment which was partially offset by a loss recognized relating to the sale of one our european businesses within our ian segment during 2009 we realized a gain of 152 related to the sale of an investment in our rabbi trusts which was partially offset by losses realized from the sale of various businesses 

vendor discounts and credit adjustments – we are in the process of settling our liabilities related to vendor discounts and credits established during the 2004 restatement these adjustments reflect the reversal of certain of these liabilities as a result of settlements with clients or vendors or where the statute of limitations has lapsed 

litigation settlement – during may 2008 the sec concluded its investigation that began in 2002 into our financial reporting practices resulting in a settlement charge of 120

our tax rates are affected by many factors including our worldwide earnings from various countries changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income in 2010 our effective tax rate of 380 was positively impacted by reversals of valuation allowances in canada and the united kingdom our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits and the taxation of foreign operations which included an income tax assessment in latin america 

in december 2010 we effectively settled with the united kingdom tax authorities for the 2007 and 2008 tax years the settlement resulted in no cash payment in september 2010 we effectively settled our new york state examination for the 19992001 tax years the settlement resulted in a cash payment of 117 consisting of 54 of tax and 63 of interest which was previously reserved 

in 2009 our effective tax rate of 388 was positively impacted by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits net which includes the recognition of tax benefits on partially worthless securities of 107 our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances the establishment of valuation allowances in the asia pacific region and the writeoff of deferred tax assets related to restricted stock 

during 2009 we finalized our proceedings with the irs appeals division for the 19972002 and 20032004 audit cycles we also finalized our irs examination for the 20052006 audit cycle as a result we recognized previously unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of 501 related to various items of income and expense including transfer pricing adjustments and adjustments relating to the 2004 restatement 

in 2008 our effective tax rate of 332 was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances the nondeductible sec settlement provision and additional net tax reserves for uncertain tax positions our effective tax rate was positively impacted in 2008 by the utilization of tax loss carryforwards against taxable profits and by the net reversal of certain valuation allowances in jurisdictions where entities have demonstrated a sustained period of profitability and future projections indicate that the trend will continue additionally we recognized tax benefits from tax law and other changes in certain us states which impacted the effective tax rate

revenue 

 

 during 2010 ian revenue increased by 4055 compared to 2009 primarily consisting of an organic revenue increase of 3305 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 584 the ian segment represents 84 of consolidated revenues and accounted for 78 of the organic increase in consolidated revenues the reasons for the organic increase are similar to those described in the consolidated revenue section the organic increase was primarily attributable to higher spending from existing clients and net client wins in most sectors of our business primarily in the auto and transportation financial services and health and personal care sectors and in nearly all regions across our advertising and media businesses the international organic increase was primarily in the latin america region mostly in brazil and in our other region which includes south africa canada and the middle east the international organic revenue increase was partially offset by organic decreases in the continental europe region primarily in italy germany and spain which includes the continued effect of a weakened economic climate in certain european countries 

 

 during 2009 ian revenue decreased by 7582 compared to 2008 primarily consisting of an organic revenue decrease of 6107 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 2166 the domestic and international organic revenue decrease was primarily driven by a pullback of existing client spending throughout all agencies within ian primarily due to challenging economic conditions and lost assignments from certain existing clients the international organic decrease occurred throughout all regions with the largest impacts in the continental europe region primarily in spain and france the united kingdom and the asia pacific region primarily in china and japan the decrease was most predominant in the technology and telecom auto and transportation and financial service sectors 

segment operating income 

 

 operating income increased during 2010 when compared to 2009 due to an increase in revenue of 4055 partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of 1262 and in office and general expenses of 859 the increase in salaries and related expenses was primarily due to higher temporary help across most of the agencies within ian to support their business growth as well as higher incentive award expense attributable to improved operating results in 2010 these increases were partially offset by lower severance expense compared to the prior year office and general expenses increased primarily due to higher production expenses and to a lesser extent higher discretionary spending and employment costs to support business growth as well as a foreign currency exchange translation loss of approximately 50 related to our

venezuela agencies transitioning to inflationary accounting as of january 1 2010 the increase in office and general expenses was partially offset by lower occupancy costs which were partly due to lease terminations we initiated in 2009 

operating income decreased during 2009 when compared to 2008 due to a decrease in revenue of 7582 partially offset by decreases in salaries and related expenses of 2863 and office and general expenses of 2070 the decrease in salaries and related expenses was primarily due to lower base salaries benefits and temporary help related to work force reductions in 2009 across all agencies within ian incentive award expense decreased during 2009 primarily due to reduced annual bonus awards consistent with the explanations provided in the consolidated salaries and related expenses section these reductions were partially offset by higher severance charges resulting from the work force actions taken during 2009 which affected all regions with the largest impact in the us and continental europe office and general expenses decreased primarily due to cost containment measures that reduced discretionary spending these reductions were partially offset by a benefit from favorable foreign currency changes in 2008 on certain balance sheet items that did not recur in 2009 

cmg 

revenue 

 

 during 2010 cmg revenue increased by 988 compared to 2009 primarily due to an organic revenue increase of 935 the cmg segment represents 16 of consolidated revenues and accounted for 22 of the organic increase of consolidated revenues the organic revenue increase was due to net client wins and increases in client spending in all major disciplines primarily in our events marketing and public relations businesses and predominantly in the domestic market these increases include the impact of higher revenue related to certain projects where we act as principal primarily in our events marketing business the international organic increase occurred primarily in the asia pacific region most notably in china and in our public relations and events marketing businesses 

 

 during 2009 cmg revenue decreased by 1769 compared to 2008 primarily due to an organic revenue decline of 1419 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 350 the domestic and international organic revenue decreases were primarily due to the completion of several projects with existing clients in 2008 that did not recur or were substantially curtailed in 2009 in our events marketing business and the pullback of existing client spending in certain of our public relations and branding businesses due to broader economic difficulties the international organic decrease occurred primarily in the united kingdom and the asia pacific region primarily in china and australia

segment operating income 

 

 operating income increased during 2010 when compared to 2009 due to an increase in revenue of 988 partially offset by increases in office and general expenses of 585 and salaries and related expenses of 323 office and general expenses increased primarily due to higher production expenses increases in salaries and related expenses were primarily due to higher base salaries benefits and temporary help in all major disciplines commensurate with regional growth and related increased headcount as well as an increase in incentive award expense due to improved operating results 

operating income decreased during 2009 when compared to 2008 due to a decrease in revenue of 1769 partially offset by decreases in office and general expenses of 842 and salaries and related expenses of 767 office and general expenses decreased primarily due to lower production expenses and to a lesser extent reductions in certain discretionary expenses these decreases were partially offset by a benefit from favorable foreign currency changes in 2008 on certain balance sheet items that did not recur in 2009 salaries and related expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in base salaries benefits and temporary help as a result of lower headcount from severance actions as well as a decrease in incentive award expense driven by lower annual bonus awards due to reduced operating results 

corporate and other 

certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line item within total segment operating income and include corporate office expenses and shared service center expenses as well as certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions salaries and related expenses include salaries longterm incentives awards annual bonuses and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees office and general expenses primarily include professional fees related to internal control compliance financial statement audits and legal information technology and other consulting services which are engaged and managed through the corporate office in addition office and general expenses also include rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees a portion of these expenses are allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the planned revenues of each of the operating units amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technologyrelated projects which are allocated based on utilization allocation methodologies in 2010 are consistent with prior years 

corporate and other expenses decreased slightly during 2010 by 53 to 1453 compared to 2009 primarily due to lower base salaries benefits and temporary help as a result of work force reductions in 2009 and decreases in various other corporate expenses which was partially offset by an increase in incentive award expense driven by improved consolidated operating results 

corporate and other expenses decreased during 2009 by 200 to 1506 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower longterm incentive award expense and reductions in professional fees the reduction in longterm incentive award expense primarily related to the vesting in the first quarter of 2009 of a onetime performancebased equity award granted in 2006 to a limited number of senior executives and to changes in our assumptions on achieving certain performance targets the decline in professional fees is primarily due to reduced audit and legal fees

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow overview 

the following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity capital resources and uses of capital 

 

  

   

 operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2010 was 8173 which is an improvement of 2765 as compared to 2009 as a result of an increase in net income of 1378 as well as an improvement in working capital of 1643 an important component of net cash provided by operating activities consists of net cash provided by working capital of 2632 due to the seasonality of our business we typically generate cash from working capital in the second half of a year and use cash from working capital in the first half of a year with the largest impacts in the first and fourth quarters the increased generation of working capital in 2010 was primarily attributable to business growth most notably at our media businesses 

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued media and production liabilities our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers 

our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments for example while annual cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities during 2010 primarily reflects payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions partially offset by net proceeds from the sales of businesses and investments capital expenditures of 963 relate to

leasehold improvements computer hardware and furniture and fixtures payments for acquisitions of 619 relate to new acquisitions primarily dlkw as well as deferred payments on prior acquisitions 

net cash provided by investing activities during 2009 includes sales and maturities of shortterm marketable securities partially offset by deferred payments on prior acquisitions and capital expenditures net sales and maturities of shortterm marketable securities of 1585 primarily relates to the redemption of a time deposit 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during 2010 includes the repurchase of a portion of our series b preferred stock for 2659 in cash payments of longterm debt of 2173 primarily as a result of the maturity of our 2010 notes distributions to noncontrolling interests of 215 and dividend payments of 196 on our series b preferred stock additionally we paid 228 for a capped call transaction related to our 475 notes see “financing and sources of funds” below for further information 

net cash used in financing activities during 2009 primarily reflects proceeds uses and fees related to our debt transactions we issued 6000 in aggregate principal amount of our 1000 senior unsecured notes due 2017 we settled the tender offers of our 2009 notes 2011 notes and 2010 notes with a cash payment of 7347 additionally we paid 360 in cash to redeem the remaining 2009 notes we paid 80 in cash to retire the remaining 450 notes and we made certain other cash payments relating to longterm debt amounts related to accrued and unpaid interest for these transactions are reflected in operating activities cash used related to these debt transactions and other debt repayments including issuance costs and discounts was 2149 net of cash proceeds from the new issuance 

foreign exchange rate changes 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in an increase of 194 during 2010 this increase primarily reflects the weakening of the us dollar against several foreign currencies partially offset by the us dollar strengthening against the euro during this period 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in an increase of 848 during 2009 this increase primarily reflects the weakening of the us dollar primarily against the euro during this period 

liquidity outlook 

we expect our cash flow from operations cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months we also have a committed corporate credit facility available to support our operating needs while we believe the economic climate has improved in many of our key markets we believe macroeconomic conditions remain somewhat uncertain and if conditions deteriorated it could challenge our level of cash generation from operations we continue to maintain a conservative approach to liquidity with flexibility over significant uses of cash including our capital expenditures and cash used for new acquisitions we are maintaining our cost discipline as we continue to position ourselves for growth 

from time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional financing or otherwise improve our liquidity profile enhance our financial flexibility and manage market risk our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors which include those specific to us such as our credit rating and those related to the financial markets such as the amount or terms of available credit there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all

financing and sources of funds 

substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies our cash balances are held in numerous jurisdictions throughout the world primarily at the holding company level and at our largest subsidiaries below is a summary of our sources of liquidity 

 

  

  credit facilities 

we maintain a committed corporate credit facility to increase our financial flexibility in april 2010 we amended and restated our credit agreement originally dated as of july 18 2008 as amended and restated as of april 23 2010 the “credit agreement” the amendments increased commitments of the lenders to 6500 from 3350 added five new lenders and extended the credit agreement’s expiration to july 18 2013 the credit agreement is a revolving facility under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 6500 or the equivalent in other currencies the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase subject to a limit on letters of credit of 2000 or the equivalent in other currencies our obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured we have not drawn on any of our corporate credit facilities since 2003 although we use them for letters of credit primarily to support obligations of our subsidiaries 

the credit agreement includes covenants that among other things limit our liens and the liens of our consolidated subsidiaries and limit subsidiary debt the credit agreement also contains covenants that subject to certain exceptions restrict us from making cash acquisitions making capital expenditures repurchasing our common stock and declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock in excess of an aggregate basket of 6000 in any fiscal year of which we may carry forward unused amounts of up to 2000 to the next fiscal year provided that a if we have a leverage ratio of greater than 275 to 1 at the end of any fiscal year we may not carry forward unused amounts and cash common stock dividends and net share repurchases not otherwise permitted will be restricted to 4000 for the next fiscal year and b if we have a leverage ratio of 275 to 1 or less at the end of any fiscal year in the next fiscal year the aggregate basket will be 8000 and cash common stock dividends and net share repurchases not otherwise permitted may not exceed 6000 in addition the aggregate basket in any fiscal year but not the amount for cash common stock dividends and net share repurchases may be increased subject to certain limitations by up to 1000 of net cash proceeds from dispositions made during such fiscal year 

we were in compliance with all applicable restrictive and financial covenants in the credit agreement as of december 31 2010 the table below sets forth the financial covenants applicable as of december 31 2010 

 

   

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

  

if we were unable to comply with these financial covenants in the future we would seek an amendment or waiver from our lenders but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver if we do not comply with these financial covenants and were unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver the credit agreement could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal in addition under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit under the credit agreement 

in december 2009 we entered into a letter of credit agreement the “2009 lc agreement” to provide for the issuance of standby letters of credit denominated in pound sterling the face amount of letters of credit outstanding under the 2009 lc agreement is subject to an aggregate limit at any one time of £450 equivalent as of december 31 2010 to 692 in january 2010 we transferred letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement to this facility to provide additional liquidity under the credit agreement as of december 31 2010 we did not have any letters of credit outstanding under the 2009 lc agreement we terminated the 2009 lc agreement as of december 31 2010 as we were no longer required to issue letters of credit associated with various projects in the united kingdom 

we also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates we use our uncommitted credit lines for working capital needs at some of our operations outside the united states and the amount outstanding as of december 31 2010 and 2009 was 1148 and 934 respectively we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations the weightedaverage interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted credit facilities as of december 31 2010 and 2009 was approximately 50 and 40 respectively 

capped call 

we purchased capped call options in november 2010 to hedge the risk of price appreciation on the 161 shares of our common stock into which our 475 notes are convertible the options give us the right to purchase up to 161 shares of our common stock at a strike price of 1242 per share subject to adjustments upon certain events with respect to us or our common stock except that the economic value of the net proceeds of exercising the options will not exceed the difference between the strike price and a cap price of 1826 per share subject to certain limitations we may elect settlement of the options to occur in cash or in shares the options will expire on april 2 2013 our capped call transaction meets the definition of an offbalance sheet arrangement per regulation sk item 303a4 

investments 

from time to time we make investments in privately held companies that we believe may be of interest to the advertising and marketing sectors these investments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at cost certain of these investments the most significant of which is facebook have significantly appreciated compared to their cost but there can be no assurance as to the terms on which we would be able to dispose of any such investments 

cash pooling 

we aggregate our net domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the united states we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several ipg agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of bank overdrafts under all of our pooling arrangements and as of december 31 2010 and 2009 the amounts netted were 9161 and 9465 respectively

debt ratings 

our longterm debt credit ratings as of february 16 2011 are listed below 

 

 the most recent changes in our credit ratings occurred in november 2010 when standard and poor’s changed our outlook from stable to positive additionally in october 2010 fitch ratings upgraded our rating from bb to bbb which is an investment grade rating and changed our outlook from positive to stable a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating credit ratings could have an impact on liquidity either adverse or favorable including among other things because they could affect funding costs in the capital markets or otherwise for example our credit agreement fees and borrowing rates are based on a credit ratings grid

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items from time to time we use derivative instruments pursuant to established guidelines and policies to manage some portion of these risks derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rates 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value of our debt obligations because the majority of our debt approximately 93 and 84 as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively bears interest at fixed rates we do have debt with variable interest rates but a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a 10 change in interest rates is summarized below 

 

 we have used interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate debt we terminated our interest rate swaps related to our 625 senior unsecured notes due 2014 the “2014 notes” in february 2010 and do not have any outstanding as of december 31 2010 

we had 26894 of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2010 that we generally invest in conservative shortterm investmentgrade securities the interest income generated from these investments is subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements during 2010 and 2009 we had interest income of 287 and 350 respectively based on our 2010 results a 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest income by approximately 270 assuming that all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were affected in the same manner and balances remain constant from yearend 2010 levels 

foreign currency rates 

we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2010 were the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar and euro based on 2010 exchange rates and operating results if the us dollar were to strengthen or weaken by 10 we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase between 3 and 5 assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2010 current levels 

the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency mitigating transaction risk however certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency the us dollar and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary our venezuela agencies transitioned to inflationary accounting on january 1 2010 and as a result we recorded a foreign exchange translation loss of approximately 50 in the first quarter of 2010 this charge was recorded in office and general expenses within the consolidated statement of operations we have remeasured our local nonmonetary transactions assets and liabilities using the exchange rate of 43 venezuelan bolivares fuertes per us dollar subsequent to the currency remeasurement this devaluation did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements as we do not have significant operations in venezuela 

credit and market risks 

balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients we invest our excess cash in investmentgrade shortterm securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 

our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year which can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods

market strategy 

we have taken several major strategic steps in recent years to position our agencies as leaders in the global advertising and communications market 

although we have seen some signs of economic stability in recent months the global economic recession made business conditions in 2009 extremely challenging for all our companies across all sectors the weak conditions in the broader economy continue to affect the demand for advertising and marketing services and present a challenge to the revenue and profit growth of companies in our industry during these challenging economic conditions we have focused on meeting our clients’ needs while carefully managing our cost structure we initiated significant severance actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 which have continued through 2009 we believe that our company is well positioned to capitalize on marketplace expansion once consumer confidence and client spending return 

we operate in a media landscape that has vastly changed over the past decade media channels continue to fragment and clients face an increasingly complex consumer environment to stay ahead of these challenges and to achieve our objectives we have invested in creative and strategic talent in highgrowth areas and have realigned a number of our capabilities to meet market demand 

 

   

  

  

  

 the aspects of our business addressing digital media continue to evolve rapidly as such strong multichannel talent is vital to our longterm success as a marketing partner to our clients in order to grow with our clients we have therefore accelerated our investment in digital talent professional training and technology throughout the organization in recent years this reflects our belief that digital marketing should not be treated as a standalone function but instead should be incorporated within all of our companies recruiting and developing digitally conversant talent at all our agencies and in all marketing disciplines is therefore an area where we continue to invest 

to meet these changing needs of the marketplace we have at times acquired or built specialty digital assets such as reprise media search engine marketing the interpublic emerging media lab and huge ecommerce solutions we have also invested in existing digital assets such as rga a standalone digital agency and industry leader in the development of awardwinning interactive campaigns for global clients these specialty assets have unique capabilities and service their own client rosters while also serving as key digital partners to many of the agencies within ipg 

likewise we continue to look for strategic investments that will position us to capitalize on fastgrowth geographic regions in recent years we have made investments in india and brazil further strengthening our leadership position in these highgrowth developing markets in 2008 we built on this strategy and completed an important transaction that increased our stake in the middle east communication networks “mcn” to a majority position headquartered in dubai we believe mcn is the region’s premier marketing services management company with 60 offices across 14 countries our partner in russia is an acknowledged advertising leader in that country in china where we operate with all of our global networks and across the full spectrum of marketing services we continue to invest behind our companies 

going forward we will continue to derive benefits from our diversified client base global footprint and broad range of services the improvements we have made in our financial reporting and business information systems during recent years provide us with timely and actionable insights from our global operations which enables us to manage our business more effectively our conservative approach to the balance sheet and liquidity as well as recent measures to further improve our debt maturity profile have given us a solid financial foundation and the flexibility required to successfully move forward as business conditions improve 

despite economic challenges clients continue to invest in marketing to protect market share and enhance brand value in 2009 ipg units were recognized with many of the industry’s most coveted honors across many advertising and marketing disciplines our agencies are invited to compete for most major new business opportunities and won a number of the year’s biggest and most competitive new business assignments we believe that the competitiveness of our offering bodes well for us when a broader economic turnaround takes hold

our agencies are located in over 100 countries including every significant world market our geographic revenue breakdown is listed below 

 

   

for further information concerning revenues and longlived assets on a geographical basis for each of the last three years see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

sources of revenue 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising marketing and communications programs in various media around the world most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies in arranging for such services to be provided we may enter into global regional and local agreements 

revenues for the creation planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative andor quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate the difference is the commission that we earn which is either retained in total or shared with the client depending on the nature of the services agreement 

we also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion event marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges 

our revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our clients our revenue tends to be higher in the second half of the calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the first half as a result of the postholiday slowdown in client activity 

 

 depending on the terms of the client contract fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways proportional performance straightline or monthly basis or completed contract fee revenue recognized on a completed contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at december 31 as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 90 days see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition accounting policies 

clients 

our holding company structure allows us to work with clients within the same business sector through our different agencies as well as maintain a diversified client base by sector in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 24 of revenue in both 2009 and 2008 however our largest client accounted for 

  

approximately 4 and 5 of revenue for 2009 and 2008 respectively based on revenue for the year ended december 31 2009 our largest clients in alphabetical order were general motors corporation johnson  johnson microsoft unilever and verizon we represent several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency systems representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time 

since we operate in a highly competitive advertising and marketing communications industry our operating companies compete amongst other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies as well as numerous independent and niche agencies in order to obtain new clients and maintain existing client relationships 

personnel 

as of december 31 2009 we employed approximately 40000 people of whom approximately 17000 were employed in the us because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success there is keen competition for qualified employees

 item 1a risk factors tableend we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions while others are more specific to us and the industry in which we operate the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial could also impair our business operations or financial condition see also “statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure” 

 

 the marketing communications business is highly competitive our agencies and media services must compete with other agencies and with other providers of creative or media services in order to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets new market participants include database marketing and modeling companies telemarketers and internet companies 

the client’s perception of the quality of our agencies’ creative work our reputation and our agencies’ reputations are important factors in determining our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis is also an important competitive consideration on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 24 of revenue in 2009 while we believe it unlikely that we would 

  

lose the entire business of any one of our largest clients at the same time due to competitive considerations a substantial decline in a large client’s advertising and marketing spending or the loss of its entire business could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 

our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

 

 the global economic recession made business conditions extremely challenging for us during 2009 the weak conditions in the broader economy continue to affect the demand for advertising and marketing services and present a challenge to the revenue and profit growth of our company 

 

 the economic downturn has severely affected the marketing services industry and the recovery of the marketing services industry could lag that of the economy generally many clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions with reductions to their marketing budgets which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses this pattern may continue or recur in the future a decrease in our revenue could pose a challenge to our cash generation from operations 

 

 we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business unfavorable economic and financial conditions like those that have impacted most sectors of the economy could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and writeoffs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients and if these effects were severe the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity for a description of our client base see “clients” in item 1 business 

 

 we maintain a committed credit facility to increase our financial flexibility the 3350 million threeyear credit agreement the “2008 credit agreement” we entered into in july 2008 includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions and if any of them were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institution’s commitment the availability of credit under that agreement would be correspondingly reduced furthermore the 2008 credit agreement contains financial covenants and continued economic difficulties could adversely affect our ability to comply with them for example if we experience substantially lower revenues a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges in 2009 and in january 2010 we obtained amendments to the 2008 credit agreement in order to retain our ability to comply with those covenants if in the future we were to conclude that we would be unable to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in the 2008 credit agreement we could be required to seek further amendments or waivers and our costs under the 2008 credit agreement could increase if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver the 2008 credit agreement could be terminated if credit under our credit facilities were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity could be adversely affected 

if our business is significantly adversely affected by the difficult economic environment or otherwise it could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our needs currently for a noninvestmentgrade company like ours the capital markets remain challenging there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook see “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

 we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and fixed assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability annually or whenever there is an indication of impairment or lack of realizability if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance in prior years we recorded substantial amounts of goodwill investment and other impairment charges and we have been required to establish substantial valuation allowances with respect to deferred tax assets 

as of december 31 2009 we have substantial amounts of longlived assets deferred tax assets and investments on our consolidated balance sheet including approximately 33 billion of goodwill future events including our financial performance market valuation of us or market multiples of comparable companies loss of a significant client’s business or strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets investments and deferred tax assets may have become impaired for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets and our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets see “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations any resulting impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized 

 

 our employees including creative research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most important assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and could be adversely affected by our financial or market performance 

 

 as of february 16 2010 our longterm debt is rated ba3 with positive outlook by moody’s investor service b with stable outlook by standard and poor’s and bb with positive outlook by fitch ratings any ratings downgrades or ratings weaker than those of our competitors can adversely affect us because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness including covenants and interest rates our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

 

 from time to time we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them see “statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure” 

 

 international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues approximately 44 in 2009 our international operations are exposed to risks that affect foreign operations of all kinds including local legislation monetary devaluation exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries in addition because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the euro pound sterling brazilian real japanese yen canadian dollar and chinese yuan renminbi fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results 

  

 our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign there has been an increasing tendency on the part of advertisers and consumer groups to challenge advertising through legislation regulation the courts or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare through the years there has been a continuing expansion of specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products representatives within government bodies both domestic and foreign continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently our revenues

executive summary 

interpublic is one of the world’s premier global advertising and marketing services companies our agencies create marketing programs for clients to achieve or improve their business results which in turn generates revenue earnings and cash flow for us comprehensive global services will remain critical to the competitiveness of our multinational clients in 2010 and beyond as they look to build brands and increase market share in an increasingly complex and fragmented media landscape our business objectives are to continue to strengthen our full range of marketing expertise while focusing our investment on the fastest growing geographic regions and marketing channels our longterm financial objectives include maintaining organic revenue growth at competitive levels while expanding operating margins accordingly we remain focused on cost control including more efficient discretionary spending and effective resource utilization including the productivity of our employees real estate and information technology 

although we have seen some signs of economic stability in recent months the global economic recession made business conditions in 2009 extremely challenging for all our companies across all sectors the weak conditions in the broader economy continue to affect the demand for advertising and marketing services and present a challenge to the revenue and profit growth of companies in our industry during these challenging conditions we have focused on meeting our clients’ needs while carefully managing our cost structure we initiated significant severance actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 which have continued through 2009 in 2009 we recognized 1655 of severance expense compared to 883 in 2008 the savings from these actions will continue to be realized in future periods we believe we are wellpositioned to capitalize on marketplace expansion once consumer confidence and client spending return going forward we will continue to derive benefits from our diversified client base global footprint and broad range of services the improvements we have made in our financial reporting and business information systems during recent years provide us with timely and actionable insights from our global operations which enables us to manage our business more effectively our conservative approach to the balance sheet and liquidity as well as recent measures to further improve our debt maturity profile have given us a solid financial foundation and the flexibility required to successfully move forward as business conditions improve

highlights 

 

 when we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance we determine the portion of the change that is attributable to foreign currency rates and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the remainder we call organic change which indicates how our underlying business performed the performance metrics that we use to analyze our results include the organic change in revenue salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses and the components of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of total revenue additionally in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by business sector where we focus on our top 100 clients which typically constitute 5055 of our consolidated revenues we also analyze revenue by geographic region 

the change in our operating performance attributable to foreign currency rates is determined by converting the priorperiod reported results using the current period exchange rates and comparing the priorperiod adjusted amounts to the priorperiod reported results although the us dollar is our reporting currency a substantial portion of our revenues and expenses are generated in foreign currencies therefore our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this translation risk as a result both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar affect our consolidated results of operations the primary foreign currencies that impact our results include the euro pound sterling brazilian real japanese yen canadian dollar and chinese yuan renminbi for 2008 foreign currency fluctuations resulted in increases of approximately 1 in revenues and operating expenses which contributed to a net increase in operating income of approximately 4 compared to the prioryear period for 2009 foreign currency fluctuations resulted in decreases of approximately 4 in revenues and operating expenses which contributed to a net decrease in operating income of approximately 4 compared to the prioryear period for most of 2009 the us dollar strengthened against several foreign currencies as compared to the prioryear period which had a negative impact on our 2009 consolidated results of operations this trend began to reverse during the latter part of 2009 as the us dollar has weakened against several foreign currencies and if this trend continues it could have a positive impact on our consolidated results of operations in 2010 

for purposes of analyzing changes in our operating performance attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures transactions are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred during the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offering and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan for additional information on our acquisitions see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for 2009 and 2008 the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures increased revenue and operating expenses compared to the respective prioryear period

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our consolidated financial statements management has discussed with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising marketing and communications programs in various media around the world most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies in arranging for such services it is possible that we will enter into global regional and local agreements agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements 

revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the price is fixed or determinable iii collectability is reasonably assured and iv services have been performed depending on the terms of a client contract fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways proportional performance straightline or monthly basis or completed contract see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

depending on the terms of the client contract revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed commissions performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both qualitative and quantitative goals performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client the classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments if the judgments change there can be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods incremental direct costs incurred related to contracts where revenue is accounted for on a completed contract basis are generally expensed as incurred there are certain exceptions made for significant contracts or for certain agencies where the majority of the contracts are projectbased and systems are in place to properly capture appropriate direct costs 

substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less passthrough expenses charged to a client in most cases the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our consolidated financial statements because of various passthrough expenses such as production and media costs in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition we assess whether our agency or the thirdparty supplier is the primary obligor and we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment in addition we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor because we operate broadly as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting accordingly we generally record revenue net of 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

  

passthrough charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business in those businesses primarily sales promotion event sports and entertainment marketing where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as office and general expenses revenue is generally reported net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenueproducing transactions 

the determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments if we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our financial performance if it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin 

we receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that based on the terms of our contracts and local law are either remitted to our clients or retained by us if amounts are to be passed through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or if retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned income or expense may also be realized in connection with settling vendor discount or credit liabilities that were established as part of the restatement we presented in our 2004 annual report on form 10k the “2004 restatement” in these situations and given the historical nature of these liabilities we have recorded such items as other income or expense as we do not consider these to be part of current operating results 

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes 

in accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets which is primarily dependent on future earnings a valuation allowance shall be recognized when based on available evidence it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods in circumstances where there is significant negative evidence establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence when evaluating a decision to establish a valuation allowance conversely a pattern of sustained profitability represents significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance further in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings in 2009 we recorded a net charge of 124 for the establishment of valuation allowances in 2008 and 2007 we recorded a net reversal of valuation allowances of 480 and 223 respectively 

the authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally guidance is provided for derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments we evaluate our tax positions using a “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information

goodwill and other intangible assets 

as a result of changes in authoritative guidance we account for our business combinations using the acquisition accounting method in 2009 while we utilized the purchase accounting method in prior years both accounting methods require us to determine the fair value of net assets acquired and the related goodwill and other intangible assets see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including projections of future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of october 1 st each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we have 15 reporting units that were subject to the 2009 annual impairment testing our reporting unit structure has not changed from 2008 except for the movement of one reporting unit into another reporting unit due to an operational decision by management during 2009 in addition deutsch and lowe were tested as separate reporting units during 2009 but will be combined into one reporting unit in 2010 as a result of their alignment our annual impairment reviews as of october 1 2009 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units 

we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the carrying value of these assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets these assets are impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair value impaired intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are written down to their fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

the authoritative guidance for goodwill specifies a twostep process for goodwill impairment testing and measuring the magnitude of any impairment the first step of the impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill the sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the first step of the impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

the fair value of a reporting unit for 2009 was estimated using a combination of the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data historically we have used a combination of the income and market approach for our analysis however the fair value of a reporting unit for 2008 was estimated using only the income approach as we determined that the market approach was not appropriate due to the deterioration and extreme volatility of the credit markets in the latter part of 2008 for 2009 we determined that the market approach was appropriate to use and we primarily applied an equal weighting to the income and market approach for our analysis for the income approach we used projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth profit margins terminal value growth rates capital expenditures projections assumed tax rates discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management for the market approach we used judgment in identifying the relevant comparable company market multiples

these estimates and assumptions vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit the discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit and the discount rates we used for our reporting units were between 120 and 150 we believe that the estimates and assumptions we made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period actual results of operations cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our valuation and it is possible that differences and changes could be material a deterioration in profitability adverse market conditions and a slower or weaker economic recovery than currently estimated by management could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge in the future 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test our sensitivity analysis provides a range of fair value for each reporting unit where the low end of the range reduces growth rates by 05 and increases discount rates by 05 and the high end of the range increases growth rates by 05 and decreases discount rates by 05 we use the average of our fair values for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the impairment test 

the following table shows the number of reporting units we tested in our 2009 and 2008 annual impairment reviews and the related goodwill value associated with the reporting units at the low end average and high end of the valuation range for a fair values exceeding carrying values by less than 10 b fair values exceeding carrying values between 10 and 20 c fair values exceeding carrying values by more than 20 and d carrying values that exceed fair value 

 

  

  one reporting unit’s carrying value was greater than its average fair value during the first step of our goodwill impairment test and we were required to perform the second step of the impairment test total goodwill at this reporting unit was 61 under the second step the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was allocated among its assets and liabilities in 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – continued

order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill we did not record an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2009 as we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill was greater than the carrying value for this reporting unit additionally no carrying value adjustment was made to the intangible assets for this reporting unit as the estimated cash flows were greater than the carrying value of these assets on an undiscounted basis 

pension and postretirement benefits 

we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations management is required to make significant judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets which are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events 

the discount rate is one of the significant assumptions that impact our net pension and postretirement costs and obligations for the domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans we determine our discount rate based on the estimated rate at which annuity contracts could be purchased to effectively settle the respective benefit obligations each plan’s projected cash flow is matched to a yield curve based on aarated corporate noncallable bonds and a present value is estimated which is then used to develop a single equivalent discount rate for the foreign pension plans we either determine our discount rate using the same methodology as described for our domestic pension plan or based on a discount rate by referencing market yields on high quality corporate bonds in the local markets with the appropriate term as of december 31 2009 for 2009 we used a weighted average discount rate of 601 554 and 600 for the domestic pension plans foreign plans and the postretirement plan respectively for 2010 we plan to use weighted average discount rates of 553 551 and 550 for the domestic pension plans foreign plans and the postretirement plan respectively changes in the discount rates are generally due to increases or decreases in longterm interest rates a higher discount rate will decrease our net pension cost a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2009 net pension and postretirement cost by approximately 20 in addition a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the december 31 2009 benefit obligation by 187 and 198 respectively 

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year for the domestic pension plans our expected rate of return considers the historical trends of asset class index returns over various market cycles and economic conditions current market conditions risk premiums associated with asset classes and longterm inflation rates we determine both a shortterm and longterm view and then attempt to select a longterm rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities for the foreign pension plans primarily the uk pension plan we determine the expected rate of return by utilizing a weightedaverage approach based on the current longterm expected rates of return for each asset category the longterm expected rate of return for the equity category is based on the current longterm rates of return available on government bonds and applying suitable risk premiums that consider historical market returns and current market expectations for 2009 we used weightedaverage expected rates of return of 816 and 505 for the domestic and foreign pension plans respectively for 2010 we plan to use weightedaverage expected rates of return of 746 and 587 for the domestic and foreign pension plans respectively changes in the rates are due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held a lower expected rate of return will increase our net pension cost a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2009 net pension cost by approximately 10

results of operations 

consolidated results of operations 

revenue 

our revenue is directly impacted by our ability to win new clients and the retention and spending levels of existing clients most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are therefore less seasonal than revenue our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal spending of our clients incentives earned at yearend on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter additionally revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of completed projects in the events marketing business as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete we generally act as principal for these projects and as such record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as passthrough costs in office and general expenses 

 

 during 2009 our revenue decreased by 9351 or 134 compared to 2008 primarily consisting of an organic revenue decrease of 7526 or 108 and an adverse foreign currency impact of 2516 the decrease is primarily attributable to the negative impact of global economic conditions on nearly all sectors of our business throughout all geographic regions our organic decrease was primarily caused by spending declines and lost assignments from several of our largest clients in the sectors of technology and telecom which is our largest sector auto and transportation and financial services two other significant sectors health and personal care and food and beverage were relatively stable in 2009 as they only had slight organic revenue decreases additionally a small percentage of our organic revenue decrease was related to prioryear project assignments in our events marketing discipline that due to economic conditions did not recur or were substantially curtailed these projects are reflected in various sectors and geographic regions 

 

 during 2008 our revenue increased by 4085 or 62 compared to 2007 primarily consisting of organic revenue growth of 2494 or 38 led by the technology and telecom and retail sectors the organic increase was driven by expanding business with existing clients and winning new clients throughout all geographic regions predominantly at ian and to a lesser extent at constituency management group “cmg”

in the latter part of 2008 economic conditions deteriorated and persisted throughout 2009 which negatively impacted our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 during the fourth quarter of 2008 our revenue decreased by 41 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 which reflected an organic revenue decrease of 22

operating expenses 

 

 salaries and related expenses 

salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs employee performance incentives including annual bonus and longterm incentive stock awards and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with shortterm changes in revenue levels however salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of hiring freelance contractors who are utilized to support business development and changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards changes in our incentive awards mix can impact futureperiod expense as annual bonus awards are expensed during the year they are earned and longterm incentive stock awards are expensed over the performance period generally three years factors impacting longterm incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting the change in our stock price and changes to our projected results which could impact the satisfaction of certain performance targets see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our incentive compensation plans 

 

 salaries and related expenses in 2009 decreased by 3814 compared to 2008 primarily consisting of an organic decrease of 2792 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 1500 the organic improvement was due to lower base salaries benefits and temporary help of 2667 primarily related to work force reductions across all networks that were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued throughout 2009 to respond to the difficult economic conditions our work force reductions resulted in an organic increase in severance charges of 799 in 2009 when compared to the prior year excluding incremental severance the organic decrease in salaries and related expenses would have been 83 when compared to 2008 the largest components of our severance charges in 2009 were related to our advertising and media businesses in the ian segment primarily in the us and continental europe regions since we started taking actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 work force reductions have decreased headcount by approximately 6400 employees representing approximately 14 of our work force we expect that our more recent work force reductions will contribute to further declines in base salaries and benefits and we currently do not anticipate significant additional work force reductions in 2010 

also contributing to the organic decrease in 2009 was a reduction in incentive award expense of 559 resulting from lower annual bonus awards and longterm incentive award expense there were lower annual bonus award accruals in 2009 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

  

due to lower operating results and to a lesser extent lower headcount when compared to the prior year the reduction in expected longterm incentive award expense was attributable to an increase in our forfeiture rate as a result of higher actual forfeitures compared to estimates changes in our assumptions on achieving certain performance targets and to a lesser extent the vesting in the first quarter of 2009 of a onetime performancebased equity award granted in 2006 to a limited number of senior executives these reductions were partially offset by higher expense due to increases in our stock price in 2009 as compared to 2008 

salaries and related expenses in 2008 increased by 2034 compared to 2007 consisting of an organic increase of 1032 net acquisitions of 594 and an adverse foreign currency impact of 408 the organic increase was primarily to support business growth an organic revenue increase of 2494 during 2008 resulting in higher base salaries benefits and temporary help of 1004 predominantly at our largest networks there was no significant change in incentive award expense compared to the prior year as longterm incentive award expense was unchanged and annual bonus award expense decreased by 151 as economic conditions deteriorated in the latter part of 2008 we incurred an organic increase in severance charges of 174 in the fourth quarter 

the following table details our salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue 

 

 our staff cost ratio defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue increased to 657 in 2009 from 624 in 2008 primarily driven by lower revenues and increased severance expense partially offset by lower base salaries benefits temporary help and incentive award expenses our staff cost ratio declined to 624 in 2008 from 632 in 2007 primarily driven by higher revenues and better utilization of base salaries and benefits expenses 

office and general expenses 

office and general expenses primarily include rent expense professional fees certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and depreciation and amortization costs office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements including production costs outofpocket costs such as travel for client service staff and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients production expenses can vary significantly between periods depending upon the timing of completion of certain projects where we act as principal which could impact trends between various periods in the future 

 

 office and general expenses in 2009 decreased by 2928 compared to 2008 primarily consisting of an organic decrease of 2385 and a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 792 the organic improvement was largely due to our cost containment efforts which resulted in lower discretionary spending primarily related to travel and entertainment office supplies and employment costs additionally approximately onethird of the organic decline was from lower production expenses related to passthrough costs for certain projects where we acted as principal that did not recur or decreased in size during 2009 these reductions were partially offset by a benefit from favorable foreign currency changes in 2008 on certain balance sheet items that did not recur in 2009 and to a lesser extent higher rent charges in 2009 due to lease terminations and other exit costs

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

  

office and general expenses in 2008 decreased by 315 compared to 2007 primarily consisting of an organic decrease of 537 the organic improvement was primarily due to reductions in professional fees occupancy costs depreciation and amortization as well as a higher focus on managing discretionary expenses the organic decrease in professional fees of 290 was primarily due to reduced legal consultations as a result of the resolution of the sec investigation and improvements in our financial systems back office processes and internal controls occupancy costs and depreciation and amortization declined and there were favorable foreign currency changes on certain balance sheet items in 2008 when compared to 2007 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in production expenses of 336 related to passthrough costs for certain projects where we acted as principal and an increase in bad debt expense related to collection concerns for certain clients 

the following table details our office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue all other office and general expenses primarily include production expenses and to a smaller extent depreciation and amortization bad debt expense foreign currency gains losses and other expenses 

 

 our office and general expense ratio defined as office and general expenses as a percentage of total consolidated revenue declined to 285 in 2009 from 289 in 2008 driven by the major expense categories that had reductions listed above partially offset by lower revenue our office and general expense ratio declined to 289 in 2008 from 312 in 2007 driven by higher revenue and reductions in key expense categories 

restructuring and other reorganizationrelated charges 

the components of restructuring and other reorganizationrelated charges is listed below 

 

 restructuring reversals charges relate to the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs and a restructuring program entered into at lowe during the third quarter of 2007 included in these net reversals charges are adjustments primarily resulting from changes in management’s estimates relating to sublease rental income assumptions and prior severance and termination related actions additionally in 2008 and 2007 net charges included adjustments resulting from severance and termination costs and accelerated leasehold amortization for the 2007 program at lowe 

other reorganizationrelated charges were separated from the rest of our operating expenses within the consolidated statements of operations because they did not result from charges that occurred in the normal course of business these charges primarily relate to the alignment of deutsch and lowe in 2009 and the realignment of our media businesses into a management entity called mediabrands in 2008 charges relate to severance and termination costs and lease termination and

other exit costs for these activities we expect to incur additional charges of approximately 15 associated with the deutsch and lowe alignment in 2010 as we finish implementing our plans the actions associated with mediabrands are complete see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

expenses and other income 

 

 net interest expense 

for 2009 as compared to 2008 cash interest expense largely related to our shortterm obligations and interest income both decreased primarily due to lower interest rates mostly in the united kingdom continental europe and to a lesser extent the united states the majority of the change in noncash interest expense resulted from a decline in amortization of deferred warrant costs and debt issuance costs in connection with the expiration of our 7500 threeyear credit agreement dated as of june 13 2006 the “2006 credit agreement” in june 2009 the decrease in noncash interest expense was partially offset by changes in the value of obligations to purchase noncontrolling equity shares of consolidated subsidiaries the value of these obligations may fluctuate depending on projected future operating performance of these subsidiaries see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

for 2008 as compared to 2007 cash interest expense decreased primarily due to the repurchase of the majority of the 450 convertible senior notes due 2023 the “450 notes” in the first quarter of 2008 lower interest rates paid on the floating rate senior unsecured notes due 2010 the “2010 notes” lower shortterm debt balances and lower interest rates at our international agencies interest income decreased due to more conservative investment strategies in the united states compared to the prior year and lower interest rates in the united states 

other income net 

results of operations include certain items which are either discrete or are not directly associated with our revenue producing operations 

 

 net loss on early extinguishment of debt – during 2009 we recorded a net charge of 251 related to the settlement of our tender offers for the 540 senior unsecured notes due 2009 the “2009 notes” 725 senior unsecured notes due 2011 the “2011 notes” and the 2010 notes the redemption of all of our outstanding 2009 notes and the retirement of our 450 notes during 2007 we recognized noncash charges related to the extinguishment of 2000 of our 450 notes see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information

vendor discounts and credit adjustments – we are in the process of settling our liabilities related to vendor discounts and credits established during the restatement we presented in our 2004 annual report on form 10k the “2004 restatement” these adjustments reflect the reversal of certain of these liabilities as a result of settlements with clients or vendors or where the statute of limitations has lapsed see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

litigation settlement – during may 2008 the sec concluded its investigation that began in 2002 into our financial reporting practices resulting in a settlement charge of 120 

investment impairments – in 2007 we realized an otherthantemporary charge of 58 relating to a 125 investment in auction rate securities representing our total investment in auction rate securities see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

income taxes 

 

 our tax rate is affected by many factors including our worldwide earnings from various countries changes in legislation and tax characteristics of our income our effective tax rate of 388 was positively impacted in 2009 by the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits net which includes the recognition of tax benefits on partially worthless securities of 107 our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances the establishment of valuation allowances in the asia pacific region and the writeoff of deferred tax assets related to restricted stock 

during 2009 we finalized our proceedings with the irs appeals division for the 19972002 and 20032004 audit cycles we also finalized our irs examination for the 20052006 audit cycle as a result we recognized previously unrecognized tax benefits and related interest of 501 related to various items of income and expense including transfer pricing adjustments and adjustments relating to the 2004 restatement 

also during 2009 we recorded a net establishment of a valuation allowance of 124 relating to deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where there was significant negative evidence causing us to believe that it is no longer “more likely than not” that the corresponding tax loss carryforward will be utilized during 2008 and 2007 we had net reversals in our valuation allowances of 480 and 223 respectively on existing deferred tax assets 

in 2008 our effective tax rate of 332 was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances the nondeductible sec settlement provision and additional net tax reserves for uncertain tax positions our effective tax rate was positively impacted in 2008 by the utilization of tax loss carryforwards against taxable profits and by the net reversal of certain valuation allowances in jurisdictions where entities have demonstrated a sustained period of profitability and future projections indicate that the trend will continue additionally we recognized tax benefits from tax law and other changes in certain us states which impacted the effective tax rate

in 2007 our effective tax rate of 250 was primarily impacted by the effective settlement of the irs examination for 2003 and 2004 which resulted in the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits of which approximately 800 was attributable to certain worthless securities deductions the tax provision for 2007 was also impacted by foreign profits subject to tax at different rates and losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances

revenue 

 

 during 2009 our revenue decreased by 7582 compared to 2008 primarily consisting of organic revenue decrease of 6107 and an adverse foreign currency impact of 2166 the domestic and international organic revenue decrease was primarily driven by a pullback of existing client spending throughout all agencies within ian primarily due to challenging economic conditions additionally contributing to the organic revenue decrease was lost assignments from certain existing clients the international organic decrease occurred throughout all regions with the largest impacts in the continental europe region primarily in spain and france the united kingdom and the asia pacific region primarily in china and japan the decrease was most predominant in the technology and telecom auto and transportation and financial service sectors however two other significant sectors health and personal care and food and beverage were relatively stable during 2009 as they only had slight decreases 

 

 during 2008 our revenue increased by 3650 compared to 2007 primarily consisting of organic revenue growth of 1848 and net acquisitions of 1094 the increase was predominantly in the technology and telecom sector and to a lesser extent in the retail and financial service sectors the domestic organic revenue increase was primarily a result of higher revenues with existing clients and net client wins primarily at mccann and mediabrands partially offsetting this domestic organic increase was decreased revenue from lowe and certain independent agencies that are largely dependent on the automobile sector and were impacted by lower revenues with existing clients and net client losses the international organic revenue increase occurred throughout all regions due to net client wins and higher revenue from existing clients the increase in the united kingdom was primarily at lowe and the increase in the asia pacific region occurred primarily in china at mccann the increase in the continental europe region occurred primarily in spain at lowe and mediabrands and the increase in the latin america region primarily occurred in brazil at draftfcb

segment operating income 

 

 operating income decreased during 2009 when compared to 2008 due to a decrease in revenue of 7582 partially offset by decreases in salaries and related expenses of 2863 and office and general expenses of 2070 the decrease in salaries and related expenses was primarily due to lower base salaries benefits and temporary help related to work force actions taken during the fourth quarter of 2008 and throughout 2009 across all agencies within ian in response to the difficult economic conditions that began in the latter part of 2008 incentive award expense was lower during 2009 primarily due to reduced annual bonus awards consistent with the explanations provided in the consolidated salaries and related expenses section these reductions were partially offset by higher severance charges resulting from the work force actions taken during 2009 which affected all regions with the largest impact in the us and continental europe office and general expenses were lower primarily attributable to cost containment measures that reduced discretionary expenses mainly related to travel and entertainment office supplies employment costs as well as lower production expenses associated with reduced project work where we acted as principal these reductions were partially offset by a benefit from favorable foreign currency changes in 2008 on certain balance sheet items that did not recur in 2009 

operating income increased during 2008 when compared to 2007 due to an increase in revenue of 3650 and a decrease in office and general expenses of 151 partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of 2175 the decrease in office and general expenses was due to favorable foreign currency changes on certain balance sheet items in 2008 when compared to 2007 and lower production expenses the decrease in office and general expenses is partially offset by increased bad debt expense and higher amortization of intangibles primarily related to acquisitions made in 2008 higher salaries and related expenses were primarily due to an increase in base salaries benefits and temporary help of 1831 to support growth in 2008 primarily at mccann and mediabrands

revenue 

 

 during 2009 our revenue decreased by 1769 compared to 2008 due to an organic revenue decline of 1419 and an adverse foreign currency impact of 350 the domestic and international organic revenue decreases were primarily due to the completion of several projects with existing clients in 2008 that did not recur or were substantially curtailed in 2009 in our events marketing business and the pullback of existing client spending in certain of our public relations and branding businesses due to broader economic difficulties the international organic decrease occurred primarily in the united kingdom and the asia pacific region primarily in china and australia

during 2008 our revenue increased by 435 compared to 2007 primarily due to organic growth of 646 partially offset by net divestitures of 218 the domestic organic revenue increase was primarily due to net client wins and increased spending from existing clients in the public relations business which covers a broad range of services and client sectors the international organic revenue increase was primarily due to the completion of several projects with existing clients and net client wins in the events marketing business in the united kingdom 

segment operating income 

 

 operating income decreased during 2009 when compared to 2008 due to a decrease in revenue of 1769 partially offset by decreases in office and general expenses of 842 and salaries and related expenses of 767 office and general expenses decreased primarily due to lower production expenses in the events marketing business and to a lesser extent reductions in certain discretionary expenses these reductions were partially offset by a benefit from favorable foreign currency changes in 2008 on certain balance sheet items that did not recur in 2009 salaries and related expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in base salaries benefits and temporary help of 591 as a result of lower headcount from severance actions additionally incentive award expense was lower during 2009 driven by lower annual bonus awards due to reduced operating results 

operating income increased during 2008 when compared to 2007 due to an increase in revenue of 435 and a decrease in office and general expenses of 91 partially offset by an increase in salaries and related expenses of 239 office and general expenses decreased primarily due to lower occupancy costs as a result of lease termination and other exit costs related to facilities exited in 2007 and due to favorable foreign currency changes on certain balance sheet items in 2008 when compared to 2007 partially offset by higher production expenses related to several projects with new and existing clients in the events marketing business salaries and related expenses increased primarily due to an increase in base salaries benefits and temporary help of 178 related to the events marketing and public relations businesses to support revenue growth 

corporate and other 

certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line item within total segment operating income and include corporate office expenses and shared service center expenses as well as certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions salaries and related expenses include salaries longterm incentives bonus and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees office and general expenses primarily include professional fees related to internal control compliance financial statement audits and legal information technology and other consulting services which are engaged and managed through the corporate office in addition office and general expenses also include rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees a portion of these expenses are allocated to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the planned revenues of each of the operating units amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technologyrelated projects which are allocated based on utilization allocation methodologies are consistent with prior years 

corporate and other expenses decreased during 2009 by 200 to 1506 compared to 2008 primarily due to lower longterm incentive award expense and reductions in professional fees the reduction in longterm incentive award expense primarily relates to the vesting in the first quarter of 2009 of a onetime performancebased equity award granted in 2006 to a limited number of senior executives and to changes in our assumptions on achieving certain performance targets the decline in professional fees is primarily due to reduced audit and legal fees 

corporate and other expenses decreased during 2008 by 453 to 1706 compared to 2007 primarily due to lower professional fees partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency changes on certain balance sheet items when

compared to 2007 lower professional fees were primarily due to improvements in our financial systems back office processes and internal controls as well as reduced legal consultations associated with the resolution of our sec investigation and other financial matters in addition base salaries benefits and temporary help decreased due to lower headcount and reduced technology projects 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow overview 

our key liquidity metrics are operating cash flow and changes in working capital the following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity capital resources and uses of capital 

 

 operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities during 2009 was 5408 which is a decrease of 3245 as compared to 2008 primarily the result of a decrease in net income of 1746 and a reduction in working capital generation of 946 net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects net income of 1434 working capital cash generation of 989 and net adjustments to reconcile net income of 3785 net adjustments to reconcile net income primarily include depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangible assets amortization of restricted stock and other noncash compensation deferred income tax benefits and the net loss on early extinguishment of debt cash generated or used by working capital reflects changes in accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients prepaid expenses and other current assets accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the combined effect of decreases in client spending as a result of economic conditions during 2009 and strong growth in the latter part of 2008 at certain of our businesses our generation of working capital decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 however continued improvement in working capital management at certain businesses contributed to our ability to generate cash from working capital in 2009 

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued media and production liabilities our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers 

our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments for example while cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year

investing activities 

net cash provided by investing activities during 2009 includes sales and maturities of shortterm marketable securities partially offset by deferred payments on prior acquisitions and capital expenditures net sales and maturities of shortterm marketable securities of 1682 primarily relates to a redemption of a time deposit 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities during 2009 primarily reflects proceeds uses and fees related to our debt transactions we issued 6000 in aggregate principal amount of 2017 notes at 97958 of par and incurred related debt issuance costs we settled tenders of our 2009 notes 2011 notes and 2010 notes with a cash payment of 7347 additionally during the third quarter of 2009 we paid 360 of cash to redeem the remaining 360 aggregate principal amount of the 2009 notes and during the fourth quarter of 2009 we paid 80 of cash to retire the remaining 87 aggregate principal amount of the 450 notes amounts related to accrued and unpaid interest for these transactions are reflected in operating activities total net cash used related to these debt transactions including issuance costs and discounts was 2102 

additionally net cash used in financing activities reflects dividend payments of 276 on our series b preferred stock and distributions to noncontrolling interests of 222 

foreign exchange rate changes 

the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents included in the consolidated statements of cash flows resulted in an increase of 848 during 2009 this increase primarily reflects the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar during this period 

liquidity outlook 

we generated significant cash from operations in 2009 and ended the year with 25061 in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities based on our cash flow forecasts we expect our cash flow from operations cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months in addition we have a committed credit facility available to support our operating needs our policy is to maintain a conservative approach to liquidity which we believe is appropriate for our company we are closely managing our spending and will defer or limit discretionary spending where appropriate while continuing to position ourselves for growth in the future 

although we have seen some signs of economic stability in recent months the difficult global economic conditions made business conditions extremely challenging for us during 2009 and should market conditions continue to adversely affect our clients it could challenge our level of cash generation from operations economic conditions have caused a decrease in demand for advertising and marketing services which led to a decrease in our revenue during 2009 although we have not experienced and currently do not expect that we will experience a material increase in client defaults a deterioration in market conditions increase the likelihood that we could experience a loss in the future we have accounts receivable related to revenues earned and for passthrough costs incurred on behalf of our clients as well as expenditures billable to clients related to costs incurred and fees earned that have not yet been billed 

we maintain a committed corporate credit facility to increase our financial flexibility we have not drawn on any of our corporate credit facilities since 2003 although we use them to issue letters of credit primarily to support commitments on behalf of certain clients our 2006 credit agreement expired in june 2009 prior to the expiration of our 2006 credit agreement we replaced a portion of this facility with our 3350 threeyear credit agreement dated as of july 18 2008 the “2008 credit agreement” the outstanding letters of credit under the 2006 credit agreement were replaced with letters of credit issued under the 2008 credit agreement in the second quarter of 2009 in december 2009 we entered into a letter of credit agreement the “2009 lc agreement” in order to provide additional liquidity under the 2008 credit agreement by replacing a portion of the letters of credit outstanding under the 2008 credit agreement as of december 31 2009 no letters of credit had been issued under the 2009 lc agreement see “financing and sources of funds” below and note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information

as discussed below we took measures in 2009 to extend our debt maturities from time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional financing or otherwise improve our liquidity profile and enhance our financial flexibility our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors which include those specific to us such as our credit rating and those related to the capital markets such as the amount or terms of available credit should we access the capital markets there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms 

funding requirements 

our most significant funding requirements include our operations noncancelable operating lease obligations acquisitions capital expenditures debt service preferred stock dividends contributions to pension and postretirement plans and taxes additionally we may be required to make payments to minority owners if put options related to prior acquisitions are exercised in any twelvemonth period we maintain substantial flexibility over certain significant uses of cash including our capital expenditures and cash used for new acquisitions notable funding requirements include

credit facilities 

the 2008 credit agreement is a revolving facility expiring july 18 2011 under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the 2008 credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 3350 or the equivalent in other currencies the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase subject to a limit on letters of credit of 2000 or the equivalent in other currencies our obligations under the 2008 credit agreement are unsecured 

 

  

 we are in compliance with all applicable restrictive and financial covenants in the 2008 credit agreement as amended as seen in the table below 

 

 

 

 

if we are unable to comply with these financial covenants in the future we would seek an additional amendment andor waiver from our lenders but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver if we do not comply with these financial covenants and are unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver the 2008 credit agreement could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal in addition under those circumstances we could be required to deposit funds with one of our lenders in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit as of december 31 2009 there was no outstanding principal and 945 in outstanding letters of credit 

under the 2009 lc agreement the face amount of letters of credit outstanding is subject to an aggregate limit at any one time of £450 equivalent as of december 31 2009 to 720 ipg has guaranteed any obligations of our subsidiary under this facility

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

  

we also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates we use our uncommitted credit lines for working capital needs at some of our operations outside the us and the amount outstanding as of december 31 2009 and 2008 was 934 and 788 respectively we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations the weightedaverage interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted credit facilities as of december 31 2009 and 2008 was approximately 2 and 3 respectively 

on june 15 2009 our 2006 credit agreement expired and as of the expiration date there was no outstanding principal in connection with the 2006 credit agreement we had issued 679 warrants with a stated exercise date of june 15 2009 based on the market price of our common stock and stated exercise prices of the warrants we did not have to make any cash payments or issue any common stock to settle the warrants see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

cash pooling 

we aggregate our net domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the us we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several interpublic agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of bank overdrafts under all of our pooling arrangements and as of december 31 2009 and 2008 the amounts netted were 9465 and 8587 respectively 

debt ratings 

our longterm debt credit ratings as of february 16 2010 are listed below 

 

 the most recent change in our credit ratings occurred on march 5 2009 when standard and poor’s changed our outlook from positive to stable a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend amounts in millions 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items from time to time we use derivatives pursuant to established guidelines and policies to manage some portion of these risks derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rates 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value of our debt obligations as the majority of our debt approximately 84 as of december 31 2009 and 2008 bears interest at fixed rates we do have debt with variable interest rates but a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and the impact of a change in interest rates is summarized below 

 

 we enter into interest rate swaps for risk management purposes to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate debt changes in interest rates could affect the amount recorded to our consolidated financial statements related to interest rate swap agreements in the third quarter of 2009 we entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted 2500 notional amount of our 3500 2014 notes from fixed rate to floating rate debt we recognize changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements as well as changes in fair value of the underlying debt within other income net and as a result we recorded a net gain of 01 for the year ended december 31 2009 in february 2010 we terminated all of our interest rate swaps see note 2 and note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

we have 25061 of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2009 which are subject to changes in interest rates and we generally invest these assets in conservative shortterm investmentgrade securities with financial institutions the interest income we obtain from these investments are subject to both domestic and foreign interest rate movements during 2009 due to significant declines in foreign interest rates and to a lesser extent domestic interest rates our interest income decreased when compared to 2008 a 1 increase or decrease in interest rates would impact our interest income by approximately 250 this assumes that all cash cash equivalents and marketable securities are impacted in the same manner and balances remain constant from yearend levels 

foreign currencies 

we are subject to translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations the primary currency exchanges that we have exposure to in 2009 are the euro pound sterling brazilian real japanese yen canadian dollar and chinese yuan renminbi based on 2009 exchange rates and operating results if the us dollar were to strengthen by 10 we currently estimate operating income would decrease between 1 and 3 this assumes that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant from current levels the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay 

  

expenses in their functional currency mitigating transaction risk however certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we monitor the currencies of countries in which we operate in order to determine if the country should be considered a highly inflationary environment a currency is determined to be highly inflationary when there is cumulative inflation of approximately 100 or more over a threeyear period if this occurs the functional currency of that country would be changed to our reporting currency the us dollar and foreign exchange gains or losses would be recognized on all monetary transactions assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar until the currency is no longer considered highly inflationary our venezuela agencies will transition to inflationary accounting on january 1 2010 and we will be recording a foreign exchange translation loss of approximately 50 in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the significant devaluation that occurred to the official rate in january 2010 this will be recorded in income before income taxes within the consolidated statement of operations going forward we will be remeasuring our local nonmonetary transactions assets and liabilities using the exchange rate of 43 venezuelan bolivars fuertes per us dollar although this devaluation will result in a reduction in the us dollar reported amount of local currency denominated revenues and expenses we do not have significant operations in venezuela and subsequent to our foreign exchange translation loss on devaluation noted above we do not expect this to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 

credit and market risks 

certain balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients we invest our excess cash in investmentgrade shortterm securities with financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 

our pension plan assets are also exposed to market risk the fair value of our pension plan assets may appreciate or depreciate during the year and can result in lower or higher pension expense and funding requirements in future periods

about us 

we are one of the world’s premier advertising and marketing services companies our agency brands create marketing solutions on behalf of clients in every major world market our companies cover the spectrum of marketing disciplines and specialties from traditional services such as consumer advertising and public relations to emerging services such as mobile and search engine marketing 

the work we produce for our clients is specific to their unique needs our solutions vary from projectbased activity involving one agency and its client to longterm fullyintegrated campaigns created by a group of our companies working together on behalf of a client with offices in over 100 countries we can operate in a single region or align work globally across all major world markets 

the role of our holding company is to provide resources and support to ensure that our agencies can best meet clients’ needs based in new york city our holding company also sets companywide financial objectives and corporate strategy directs collaborative interagency programs establishes financial management and operational controls guides personnel policy conducts investor relations and oversees mergers and acquisitions in addition we provide limited centralized functional services that offer our companies operational efficiencies including accounting and finance marketing information retrieval and analysis legal services real estate expertise travel services recruitment assistance employee benefits and executive compensation management 

to keep our company wellpositioned in an evolving industry we support our agencies’ talent and operational initiatives to expand highgrowth capabilities and build offerings in key developing markets when appropriate we also develop relationships with companies that are building leadingedge marketing tools that complement our agencies and the programs they are developing for clients in addition we look for opportunities within our company to modernize operations through mergers strategic alliances and the development of internal programs that encourage intracompany collaboration 

market strategy 

we have taken several major strategic steps in recent years to position our agencies as leaders in the global advertising and communications market 

we operate in a media landscape that has vastly changed since the start of the decade media markets continue to fragment and clients face an increasingly complex consumer environment to stay ahead of these challenges and to achieve our objectives we have invested in creative and strategic talent in highgrowth areas and have realigned a number of our capabilities to meet market demand at our mccann worldgroup unit a premier global integrated network we have continued to invest in talent so as to upgrade the group’s integrated marketing services offering at mrm momentum and mccann healthcare we combined accountable marketing and consumer advertising agencies to form the unique global offering of draftfcb we have taken significant actions to realign resources behind a more focused and strategic offering at lowe in recent years and at our marketing services group constituency management group “cmg” we continue to strengthen our public relations and events marketing specialists we have also taken a unique approach to our media offering by installing a single management structure mediabrands to oversee all media operations while concurrently 

  

aligning our global media networks with our global brand agencies this approach ensures that the ideas we develop for clients work across new and traditional media channels starting at the end of 2007 and continuing through 2008 this differentiated media strategy has begun to gain significant traction in the marketplace 

strong multichannel talent is vital to our longterm success as a marketing partner to our clients the aspects of our business addressing digital media continue to evolve rapidly in order to grow with our clients we have accelerated our investment in digital talent professional training and technology throughout the organization this reflects our belief that digital marketing should not be treated as a silo but instead should be incorporated within all of our assets recruiting and developing digitally conversant talent at all our agencies and in all marketing disciplines is therefore an area where we continue to invest 

to meet these changing needs of the marketplace it is at times necessary to acquire or build specialty digital assets such as reprise media search engine marketing the interpublic emerging media lab huge ecommerce solutions or ansible mobile marketing rga a standalone digital agency is an industry leader in the development of awardwinning interactive campaigns for global clients these specialty assets have unique capabilities and service their own client rosters while also serving as key digital partners to many of the agencies within ipg 

likewise we continue to look for strategic investments that will position us to capitalize on emerging markets in 2007 we made investments in india and brazil further strengthening our presence in these highgrowth developing markets in 2008 we built on this strategy and completed an important transaction that increased our stake in the middle east communication networks mcn to a majority position headquartered in dubai mcn is the region’s premier marketing services management company with 60 offices across 14 countries our partner in russia is the acknowledged advertising leader in that country in china where we operate with all of our global networks and across the full spectrum of marketing services we continue to invest behind our companies 

in the latter part of 2008 the economy and financial markets throughout the world deteriorated rapidly and are expected to remain weak for much of 2009 these conditions present potentially significant challenges to the revenue growth of our company and others in the advertising and marketing sector during the upcoming year the demand for our services as well as the financial condition of some of our clients has been adversely affected while it is unclear how long these conditions will persist we believe that our broad range of service offerings our diversified client base our geographic diversification our strong talent our liquidity position and our enhanced expense management capabilities provide a measure of protection in a harsh economic climate

financial reporting segments 

we have two reportable segments integrated agency network “ian” which is comprised of mccann draftfcb lowe mediabrands and our domestic integrated agencies and constituency management group “cmg” which is comprised of the bulk of our specialist marketing service offerings we also report results for the “corporate and other” group see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

principal markets 

our agencies are located in over 100 countries including every significant world market for 2008 our geographic revenue breakdown is as follows 

 

 for further information concerning revenues and longlived assets on a geographical basis for each of the last three years see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

sources of revenue 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising marketing and communications programs in various media around the world most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the basis on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies in arranging for such services to be provided we may enter into global regional and local agreements 

revenues for the creation planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative andor quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate the difference is the commission that we earn which is either retained in total or shared with the client depending on the nature of the services agreement 

we also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion event marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor in some instances we agree with the provider that we will only be liable to pay the production and media costs after the client has paid us for the charges 

our revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our clients our revenue tends to be higher in the second half of the calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the first half as a result of the postholiday slowdown in client activity 

 

 depending on the terms of the client contract fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways proportional performance straightline or monthly basis or completed contract fee revenue recognized on a completed contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at december 31 as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 90 days see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policies 

  

clients 

our holding company structure allows us to work with clients within the same business sector through our different agencies as well as maintain a diversified client base by sector in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 26 of revenue in 2008 and 2007 however our largest client accounted for approximately 5 and 6 of revenue for 2008 and 2007 respectively based on revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 our largest clients in alphabetical order were general motors corporation johnson  johnson microsoft unilever and verizon we represent several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency systems representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to another one of our agencies or to a competing agency and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time 

personnel 

as of december 31 2008 we employed approximately 45000 persons of whom approximately 19000 were employed in the us because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success there is keen competition for qualified employees

 item 1a risk factors tableend we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to general economic and financial conditions of the industry in which we operate while others are more specific to us the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial could also impair our business operations or financial condition see also statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure 

 

 the marketing communications business is highly competitive our agencies and media services must compete with other agencies and with other providers of creative or media services in order to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets new market participants include systems integrators database marketing and modeling companies telemarketers and internet companies 

the client’s perception of the quality of an agency’s creative work our reputation and the agencies’ reputations are important factors in determining our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients 

  

particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis is also an important competitive consideration on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 26 of revenue in 2008 while we believe it unlikely that we would lose the entire business of any one of our largest clients at the same time due to competitive considerations a substantial decline in a large client’s advertising and marketing spending or the loss of its entire business could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 

our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

 

 economic and financial conditions deteriorated sharply in the latter part of 2008 and the deterioration is persisting in 2009 the effects could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

 economic downturns could affect the marketing services industry more severely than other industries and the recovery of the marketing services industry could lag that of the economy generally in the past some clients have responded to weakening economic conditions with reductions to their marketing budgets which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses this pattern may recur in the future a decrease in our revenue could pose a challenge to our cash generation from operations 

 

 we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business the current unfavorable economic and financial conditions that are impacting most sectors of the economy could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us the direct impact on us could include reduced revenues and writeoffs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients and if these effects were severe the indirect impact could include impairments of goodwill credit facility covenant violations or reduced liquidity our largest single client accounted for approximately 5 of revenue in 2008 and approximately 4 of accounts receivable at december 31 2008 for a description of our client base see item 1 business — clients 

 

 we maintain committed credit facilities to increase our financial flexibility the 335 million credit facility we entered into in july 2008 includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions and if any of them were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institution’s commitment the availability of credit under that agreement would be correspondingly reduced furthermore that agreement contains financial covenants and the current economic difficulties could adversely affect our ability to comply with them for example if we experience substantially lower revenues a substantial increase in client defaults or sizable asset impairment charges if we were to fail to comply with any of the financial covenants contained in that agreement we could 

  

be required to seek an amendment or waiver and our costs under the agreement could increase if we were unable to obtain a necessary amendment or waiver the agreement could be terminated the 750 million credit facility we entered into in june 2006 expires in june 2009 and we do not plan on replacing the full amount of that facility if credit under our credit facilities were unavailable or insufficient our liquidity could be adversely affected 

if our business is significantly adversely affected by further deterioration in the economic environment or otherwise it could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our needs currently for a noninvestmentgrade company such as ours the capital markets are challenging with limited available financing and at higher costs than in recent years there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all for further discussion of our liquidity profile and outlook see “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 

 

 we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and fixed assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability at least annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment or lack of realizability if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance in 2006 and prior years we have recorded substantial amounts of goodwill investment and other impairment charges and have been required to establish substantial valuation allowances with respect to deferred tax assets and loss carryforwards 

as of december 31 2008 we have substantial amounts of longlived assets investments and deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet including approximately 32 billion of goodwill future events including our financial performance market valuation of us or comparable companies loss of a significant client’s business or strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets investments and deferred tax assets may have become impaired we discuss our policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets and our sensitivity analysis of our valuation of these assets below under “critical accounting estimates” in part ii item 7 any resulting impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized 

 

 our employees including creative research media and account specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most important assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and could be adversely affected by our financial or market performance 

 

 our longterm debt is currently rated ba3 with positive outlook by moody’s b with positive outlook by standard and poor’s and bb with positive outlook by fitch any ratings downgrades or ratings weaker than those of our competitors can adversely affect us because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness including covenants and interest rates our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

 

 from time to time we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance that are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any 

  

target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them see “statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure” 

 

 international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues approximately 45 in 2008 our international operations are exposed to risks that affect foreign operations of all kinds including local legislation monetary devaluation exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries in addition because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the euro pound sterling brazilian real japanese yen canadian dollar and south african rand fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results 

 

 our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign there has been an increasing tendency on the part of advertisers and consumer groups to challenge advertising through legislation regulation the courts or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare through the years there has been a continuing expansion of specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products representatives within government bodies both domestic and foreign continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently our revenues

recent accounting standards by reference to note 17 to the consolidated financial statements provides a description of accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement and may be applicable to our future operations 

executive summary 

we are one of the world’s premier global advertising and marketing services companies our agencies create marketing programs for clients to improve business results for them and generate sales earnings and cash flow for us our agencies deliver services across the full spectrum of marketing disciplines and specialties including advertising direct marketing public relations mobile marketing internet and search engine marketing social media marketing and media buying and planning major global brands in our portfolio of companies include draftfcb futurebrand golinharris initiative jack morton lowe mccann erickson momentum mrm octagon universal mccann and weber shandwick leading domestic brands include campbellewald carmichael lynch deutsch hill holliday the martin agency mullen and rga 

in early 2006 the senior management team of interpublic announced a threeyear strategic plan to return the company to competitive growth and significantly enhance profitability while concurrently addressing a range of legacy issues stemming largely from previous underinvestment in talent and shortcomings in our financial control environment the first two years of this plan saw us invest to strengthen leadership and talent at the parent company and across our agencies including programs to foster diversity and inclusion throughout our organization and we strategically realigned and refocused certain key operating units we also enhanced the company’s financial strength liquidity and flexibility and succeeded in remediating the weaknesses in our internal control structure progress in all of these areas led to significantly improved financial performance during 2008 the third year of our program we continued to build on our momentum achieving organic revenue growth that was fully competitive with that of our global peer group and operating margins significantly higher than we reported in 2005 preceding the implementation of our strategic plan 

the global economic environment in which we operate deteriorated significantly over the course of 2008 at first relatively slowly then accelerating in the latter part of the year we believe that our performance in this challenging environment further reflects the success of our turnaround strategies for 2009 and beyond our strategic outlook is for a media landscape that continues to grow more complex and that our highquality

comprehensive global services will remain critical to the competitiveness of our clients our objectives are to continue to build our talent across the full range of marketing competencies while focusing our investment on the fastest growing markets and disciplines our financial objectives include furthering our margin progress to achieve peerlevel operating margin over the long term accordingly we remain focused on cost control and resource utilization including the productivity of our employees real estate and information technology 

we begin 2009 with the global economy in recession and widespread uncertainty in financial markets which has made business conditions more challenging for nearly all companies it is apparent that these conditions will adversely affect the demand for advertising and marketing services in 2009 and as a result present a challenge to the revenue and profit growth of our company and our sector while we cannot predict the magnitude and duration of the economic downturn or its impact on the demand for our services we believe that we will continue to derive benefits from our diversified client base global presence and broad range of services recent improvements in our financial reporting and business information systems provide us with timely and actionable insights from our businesses around the world our extensive operating improvements over the past three years have greatly strengthened our cash flow generation and our balance sheet and liquidity are important sources of financial flexibility these should provide a measure of protection in a harsh business environment 

highlights 

 

 we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance by determining the portion of the change that is attributable to foreign currency rates and the change attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and consider the remainder to be the organic change for purposes of analyzing this change acquisitions and divestitures are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred during the past few years we have acquired companies that we believe will enhance our offering and disposed of businesses that are not consistent with our strategic plan for additional information on our acquisitions see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements an analysis of 2008 compared to 2007 shows net acquisitions increased revenue and operating expenses while an analysis of 2007 compared to 2006 shows net divestitures decreased revenue and operating expenses additionally in certain of our discussions we analyze revenue by business sector and geographic region in our business sector analysis we focused on our top 100 clients which represent over 50 of our consolidated revenue

on july 9 2008 we announced the creation of a management entity called mediabrands to oversee our media assets that are included in our integrated agency networks “ian” segment the new entity provides oversight to ensure operational efficiency and increased collaboration across our media units our global media networks initiative and universal mccann continue to operate as independent entities each aligned where appropriate with a fullservice marketing network partner the businesses that comprise mediabrands remain in the ian segment the financial results for these units are analyzed together in the mda for 2008 compared to 2007 and 2007 compared to 2006 

although the us dollar is our reporting currency a substantial portion of our revenues is generated in foreign currencies therefore our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this translation risk as a result both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar will continue to affect our results of operations foreign currency fluctuations resulted in increases of approximately 1 in revenues and operating expenses which resulted in an increase of approximately 4 in operating income for 2008 as compared to 2007 in the second half of the year the us dollar strengthened against several foreign currencies and if this trend continues it could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations 

critical accounting estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and notes we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our financial statements management has discussed with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

revenue recognition 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising marketing and communications programs in various media around the world most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across many of our agencies in arranging for such services it is possible that we will enter into global regional and local agreements multiple agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements 

revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the price is fixed or determinable iii collectibility is reasonably assured and iv services have been performed depending on the terms of a client contract fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways proportional performance straightline or monthly basis or completed contract see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued

depending on the terms of the client contract revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed commissions performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both qualitative and quantitative goals performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client the classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments if the judgments change there can be a material impact on our financial statements and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods incremental direct costs incurred related to contracts where revenue is accounted for on a completed contract basis are generally expensed as incurred there are certain exceptions made for significant contracts or for certain agencies where the majority of the contracts are projectbased and systems are in place to properly capture appropriate direct costs 

substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less passthrough expenses charged to a client in most cases the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our financial statements because of various passthrough expenses such as production and media costs in compliance with emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 9919 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  we assess whether our agency or the thirdparty supplier is the primary obligor we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment in addition we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor because we operate broadly as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting accordingly we generally record revenue net of passthrough charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business in those businesses primarily sales promotion event sports and entertainment marketing where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as office and general expenses revenue is reported net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenueproducing transactions 

the determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments if we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our financial performance if it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin 

we receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that based on the terms of our contracts and local law are either remitted to our clients or retained by us if amounts are to be passed through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or if retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned negotiations with a client at the close of a current engagement could result in either payments to the client in excess of the contractual liability or in payments less than the contractual liability these items referred to as concessions relate directly to the operations of the period and are recorded as operating expense or income concession income or expense may also be realized in connection with settling vendor discount or credit liabilities that were established as part of the restatement we presented in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2004 that we filed in september 2005 the “2004 restatement” in these situations and given the historical nature of these liabilities we have recorded such items as other income or expense in order to prevent distortion of current operating results

income taxes 

the provision for income taxes includes federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes 

under sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes “sfas 109”  we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets the realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings sfas 109 requires that a valuation allowance be recognized when based on available evidence it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods in circumstances where there is significant negative evidence establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence under the provisions of sfas 109 a pattern of sustained profitability is considered significant positive evidence when evaluating a decision to reverse a valuation allowance further in those cases where a pattern of sustained profitability exists projected future taxable income may also represent positive evidence to the extent that such projections are determined to be reliable given the current economic environment accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our current and future earnings in 2008 2007 and 2006 we recorded a net reversal of valuation allowances of 480 223 and 296 respectively 

financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes “fin 48” prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally fin 48 provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments we evaluate our tax positions using a “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then we apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

we account for our business combinations using the purchase accounting method the total costs of the acquisitions are allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values and the remainder allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization as of october 1 st of each year and whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we have 16

reporting units subject to the 2008 annual impairment testing that are either entities at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level our annual impairment reviews as of october 1 2008 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units during 2008 we added a reporting unit due to a recent acquisition and changed the structure of certain reporting units due to the creation of mediabrands besides the aforementioned changes our reporting unit structure has not changed from 2007 

we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit significant decline in stock price or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” specifies a twostep process for goodwill impairment testing and measuring the magnitude of any impairment the first step of the impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill the sum of the fair values of all our reporting units is reconciled to our current market capitalization plus an estimated control premium goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the first step of the impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step which is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

the fair value of a reporting unit for 2008 was estimated using the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method in prior years we have used a combination of the income approach and the market approach which incorporates the use of earnings and revenue multiples based on market data however due to the deterioration and extreme volatility of the credit markets in the latter part of 2008 we determined that the market approach was not appropriate therefore we used only the income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units in 2008 this approach uses projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions for each reporting unit as to matters such as revenue growth profit margins terminal value growth rates capital expenditures assumed tax rates and discount rates these estimates and assumptions will vary between each reporting unit depending on the facts and circumstances specific to that unit the discount rate for each reporting unit is influenced by general market conditions as well as factors specific to the reporting unit our discount rates used for our reporting units for our 2008 annual impairment review were between 11 and 155 we believe that the estimates and assumptions made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period actual results of operations cash flows and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in a discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences and changes could be material 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis to detail the impact that changes in assumptions may have on the outcome of the first step of the impairment test our sensitivity analysis provides a range of value for each reporting unit where the low end of the range reduces growth rates by 05 and increases discount rates by 05 and the high end of the range increases growth rates by 05 and decreases discount rates by 05 for purposes of our comparison between carrying value and fair value for the first step of the impairment test we use the average of our range of values 

the following table shows the number of reporting units we tested in our 2008 and 2007 annual impairment reviews and the related goodwill value associated with the reporting units at the low end average and high end of

the valuation range for a fair values exceeding carrying values by less than 10 b fair values between 10 and 20 above carrying value c fair values more than 20 above carrying value and d carrying values that exceed fair value 

 

  

  

 during the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2008 our stock price declined significantly after our annual impairment review date and our market capitalization was less than our book value as of december 31 2008 we considered whether there were any events or circumstances indicative of a triggering event and determined that the decline in our stock price during the fourth quarter was an event that would “more likely than not” reduce the fair value of our individual reporting units below their book value requiring us to perform an interim impairment test for goodwill at the reporting unit level based on the interim impairment test conducted we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill as of december 31 2008 however current economic conditions could continue or worsen in 2009 and could alter the assumptions we made with respect to our discounted cash flow models as of december 31 2008 therefore we will continue to monitor our market capitalization and the fair values of our individual reporting units throughout 2009

the discount rate is one of the significant assumptions that impacts our net pension and postretirement costs and obligations for the domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans we determine our discount rate based on the estimated rate at which annuity contracts could be purchased to effectively settle the respective benefit obligations to assist in this we utilize a yield curve based on moody’s aarated corporate noncallable bonds each plan’s projected cash flow is matched to this yield curve and a present value is developed which is then used to develop a single equivalent discount rate for the foreign pension plans we determine a discount rate by referencing market yields on high quality corporate bonds in the local markets with the appropriate term as of december 31 2008 for 2009 we plan to use weighted average discount rates of 601 538 and 600 for the domestic pension plans foreign plans and the postretirement plan respectively changes in the discount rates are generally due to increases or decreases in longterm interest rates a higher discount rate will decrease our pension cost a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2008 net pension and postretirement cost by 21 and 22 respectively in addition a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the december 31 2008 benefit obligation by 173 and 180 respectively 

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year for the domestic pension plans our expected rate of return considers the historical trends of asset class index returns over various market cycles and economic conditions current market conditions risk premiums associated with asset classes and longterm inflation rates we determine both a shortterm and longterm view and then attempt to select a longterm rate of return assumption that matches the duration of our liabilities for the foreign pension plans primarily the uk pension plan we determine the expected rate of return by utilizing a weighted average approach based on the current longterm expected rates of return for each asset category the longterm expected rate of return for the equity category is based on the current longterm rates of return available on government bonds and applying suitable risk premiums that consider historical market returns and current market expectations for 2009 we plan to use weighted average expected rates of return of 816 and 505 for the domestic and foreign pension plans respectively changes in the rates are due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held a lower expected rate of return will increase our net pension cost a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2008 net pension cost by 10

revenue 

our revenue is directly impacted by our ability to win new clients and retain existing ones and spending levels of all our clients our revenue is also subject to fluctuations related to seasonal spending by our clients most of our expenses are recognized ratably throughout the year and are less seasonal than revenue our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter this reflects the seasonal holiday spending of our clients incentives earned at yearend on various contracts and project work completed that is typically recognized during the fourth quarter additionally revenues can fluctuate throughout the year due to the timing of completed projects in the events marketing business as revenue is typically recognized when the

project is complete furthermore we generally act as principal for these projects and as such record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as passthrough costs in office and general expenses 

 

 during 2008 our revenue increased by 4085 consisting of organic revenue growth of 2494 led by the technology and telecommunications sector and the retail sector the domestic organic growth was primarily driven by expanding business with existing clients and winning new clients in the advertising media and public relations businesses the international organic increase occurred throughout all regions the increase in the united kingdom was primarily due to the completion of several projects with existing clients and net client wins in the events marketing business and winning new clients in the advertising business the international growth was also driven by increased client spending and net client wins primarily in brazil china and spain 

the deteriorating economic conditions in the latter part of 2008 negatively impacted our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008 our revenue decreased by 41 in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 which reflects an organic revenue decrease for the quarter of 22 if weak global economic conditions persist in 2009 our revenues may remain under pressure across many of our service offerings and client sectors 

 

 during 2007 our revenue increased by 3634 consisting of organic revenue growth of 2366 and favorable foreign currency rate impact of 1975 the domestic organic growth was primarily driven through expanding business with existing clients winning new clients in advertising and public relations and completing several projects within the events marketing business the international organic revenue increase was primarily driven by increases in spending by existing clients in the asia pacific region partially offset by net client losses in continental europe primarily in france

operating expenses 

 

 total operating expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue in 2008 when compared to 2007 we consider the change in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue which we refer to as operating expense leverage to be a key performance metric 

our staff cost ratio defined as salaries and related expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to 624 in 2008 from 632 in 2007 the improvement was driven by higher revenues and better utilization of base salaries and benefits expenses our office and general expense ratio defined as office and general expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to 289 in 2008 from 312 in 2007 this improvement was also driven by higher revenue and by a reduction in key expense categories primarily professional fees 

salaries and related expenses 

salaries and related expenses consist of payroll costs employee performance incentives including cash bonus and longterm incentive stock awards and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with shortterm changes in revenue levels however salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of hiring freelance contractors who are utilized to support business development changes in the performance levels and types of employee incentive awards changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses changes in our incentive awards mix can impact future period expense as bonus awards are expensed during the year they are earned and longterm incentive stock awards are expensed over the performance period generally three years other factors impacting the expense associated with longterm incentive awards are the actual number of awards vesting and the change in our stock price additionally changes can occur based on projected results and could impact trends between periods in the future

the following table details our salary and related expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenue 

 

 salaries and related expenses in 2008 increased by 2034 compared to 2007 consisting of an organic salary increase of 1032 net acquisitions of 594 and an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 408 the organic increase was primarily to support business growth an organic revenue increase of 2494 during 2008 resulting in higher base salaries benefits and temporary help of 1004 predominantly at our largest networks there was no significant change in incentive award expense compared to the prior year as stockbased compensation expense was unchanged and annual bonus award expense decreased by 151 

as economic conditions deteriorated in the latter part of 2008 we took measures to realign our businesses resulting in severance charges of 484 in the fourth quarter which was an increase of 164 over the comparable prior year period these expenses were spread across multiple business units and geographic regions 

salaries and related expenses in 2007 increased by 1951 compared to 2006 consisting of an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 1222 and an organic salary increase of 1054 the organic increase was primarily to support business growth an organic revenue increase of 2366 resulting in higher base salaries benefits and temporary help of 991 predominantly at our largest networks additionally incentive awards increased by 317 primarily due to improved operating performance versus financial targets at certain operating units higher stockbased compensation awards due to the effect of equity awards granted in june 2006 and a onetime performancebased equity award granted in 2006 to a limited number of senior executives across the company these increases were offset by a decrease in severance expense of 224 

office and general expenses 

office and general expenses primarily include rent expense professional fees certain expenses incurred by our staff in servicing our clients and depreciation and amortization costs office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements including production costs outofpocket costs such as travel for client service staff and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients production expenses can vary significantly between periods depending upon the timing of completion of certain projects where we act as principal which could impact trends between various periods in the future

the following table details our office and general expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenue all other office and general expenses primarily include production expenses and to a smaller extent depreciation and amortization bad debt expense foreign currency gains losses and other expenses 

 

 office and general expenses in 2008 decreased by 315 compared to 2007 including an organic decrease of 537 the organic improvement was primarily due to reductions in professional fees occupancy costs depreciation and amortization as well as a higher focus on managing discretionary expenses the organic decrease in professional fees of 290 was primarily due to reduced legal consultations as a result of the resolution of the sec investigation and further improvements in our financial systems back office processes and internal controls occupancy costs and depreciation and amortization declined and there were favorable foreign currency changes on certain balance sheet items in 2008 when compared to 2007 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in production expenses of 336 related to higher passthrough costs for certain projects where we act as principal and an increase in bad debt expense related to collection concerns for certain clients 

office and general expenses in 2007 decreased by 342 compared to 2006 consisting of an organic decrease of 564 and net divestitures of 438 partially offset by an adverse foreign currency rate impact of 660 the organic decrease was primarily due to improvements in our financial systems backoffice processes and internal controls we made throughout 2007 that resulted in a reduction in professional fees of 758 additionally occupancy costs including depreciation and amortization declined by 136 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in production expenses of 342 related to passthrough costs for certain projects where we acted as principal during 2007 

restructuring and other reorganizationrelated charges 

the components of restructuring and other reorganizationrelated charges were as follows 

 

 restructuring charges relate to the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs and a restructuring program entered into at lowe worldwide “lowe” during the third quarter of 2007 included in these net charges are adjustments primarily resulting from severance and termination costs and accelerated leasehold amortization for the 2007 program at lowe and changes in management’s estimates relating to sublease rental income assumptions and prior severance and termination related actions

other reorganizationrelated charges relate to our realignment of our media businesses into a newly created management entity called mediabrands and the 2006 merger of draft worldwide and foote cone and belding worldwide to create draftfcb charges relate to severance and terminations costs and lease termination and other exit costs we expect charges associated with mediabrands to be completed during the first half of 2009 charges related to the creation of draftfcb in 2006 are complete the charges were separated from the rest of our operating expenses within the consolidated statements of operations because they did not result from charges that occurred in the normal course of business 

longlived asset impairment and other charges 

during our annual impairment review as of october 1 2006 our discounted future operating cash flow projections at one of our domestic advertising reporting units indicated that the implied fair value of the goodwill at this reporting unit was less than its book value primarily due to client losses as a result we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 272 in 2006 in our ian segment 

expenses and other income 

 

 net interest expense 

for 2008 as compared to 2007 cash interest expense decreased primarily due to the repurchase of the majority of the 450 convertible senior notes in the first quarter of 2008 lower interest rates paid on the floating rate senior unsecured notes lower shortterm debt balances and lower interest rates at our international agencies interest income decreased due to more conservative investment strategies in the us compared to the prior year and lower interest rates in the us for 2007 as compared to 2006 cash interest expense increased due to higher shortterm debt balances and interest income increased due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates at some of our international agencies 

noncash amortization expense primarily consists of amortization of debt issuance costs and deferred warrant costs in connection with our 2006 committed credit agreement that expires in june 2009 and as a result noncash amortization expense is expected to decrease in 2009 additionally noncash amortization is offset primarily by the amortization of the loss on extinguishment of 4000 of our 450 convertible senior notes in 2006

sale of businesses and investments — primarily includes realized gains and losses relating to the sales of businesses cumulative translation adjustment balances from the liquidation of entities and sales of marketable securities and investments in publicly traded and privately held companies in our rabbi trusts losses in 2007 primarily related to the sale of several businesses within draftfcb for a loss of 93 and charges at lowe of 78 as a result of the realization of cumulative translation adjustment balances from the liquidation of several businesses gains in 2006 primarily related to a net gain of 209 from the sale of an investment located in asia pacific and the sale of our remaining ownership interest in an agency within lowe we also sold our interest in a german advertising agency and recognized its remaining cumulative translation adjustment balance which resulted in a noncash benefit of 170

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

  

in 2008 our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances the nondeductible sec settlement provision and additional net tax reserves for uncertain tax positions our effective tax rate was positively impacted in 2008 by the utilization of tax loss carryforwards against taxable profits and by the net reversal of certain valuation allowances in jurisdictions where entities have demonstrated a sustained period of profitability and future projections indicate that the trend will continue additionally we recognized tax benefits from tax law and other changes in certain us states which impacted the effective tax rate 

during 2008 we recorded a net reversal of valuation allowances of 480 relating to deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where the available evidence was sufficiently positive for us to believe that it is now more likely than not that the corresponding tax loss carryforward will be utilized we believe we have appropriately considered the current economic climate in relying on the level of projected taxable income during 2007 and 2006 we had net reversals in our valuation allowances of 223 and 296 respectively on existing deferred tax assets 

the tax provision for 2007 was primarily impacted by the effective settlement of the irs examination for 2003 and 2004 which resulted in the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits of which approximately 800 was attributable to certain worthless securities deductions the favorable impact of this item and other net reserve releases are primary reasons for the change in the effective tax rate compared to 2006 the tax provision for 2007 was also impacted by foreign profits subject to tax at different rates and losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances 

the tax provision for 2006 was primarily impacted by domestic losses foreign profits subject to tax at different rates and losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances

partially offsetting this domestic organic increase was decreased revenue from lowe and certain independent agencies that are largely dependent on the automobile sector due to lower revenues with existing clients and net client losses the international organic revenue increase occurred throughout all regions mccann’s revenue increased due to higher revenue from existing clients in the continental europe region and net client wins and higher revenue from existing clients in the asia pacific region primarily in china lowe’s revenue increase was primarily due to higher revenue from existing clients and net client wins predominantly in the asia pacific the united kingdom and continental europe regions primarily in spain and france mediabrands contributed to the revenue increase in the continental europe region primarily in spain draftfcb’s revenue increased in latin america due to higher revenues with existing clients primarily in brazil

revenue 

 

 during 2008 revenue increased by 435 due to organic revenue growth of 646 led by public relations which covers a broad range of services and client sectors the domestic organic revenue increase was primarily due to net client wins and increased spending from existing clients in the public relations business the international organic revenue increase was primarily from the completion of several projects with existing clients and net client wins in the events marketing business in the united kingdom revenues in the events marketing business can fluctuate due to timing of completed projects where we act as principal as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete

corporate and other expenses decreased during 2008 by 453 to 1706 this was primarily due to lower professional fees partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency changes on certain balance sheet items when compared to 2007 lower professional fees were primarily due to improvements in our financial systems back office processes and internal controls as well as reduced legal consultations associated with the resolution of our sec investigation and other financial matters in addition base salaries benefits and temporary help decreased due to lower headcount and reduced technology projects as a result we had lower internal expenses allocated to our operating divisions 

corporate and other expenses decreased during 2007 by 594 to 2159 this was primarily driven by improvements in our financial systems backoffice processes and internal controls which resulted in a reduction in professional fees partially offsetting this reduction were higher salaries and related expenses primarily related to longterm incentive award accruals for a onetime performancebased equity award granted in 2006 to a limited number of senior executives across the company and the transfer of resources into a global finance organization as part of a regional monitoring program in addition amounts allocated to operating divisions increased primarily due to the charging of shared services expenses that were not previously allocated as well as for costs relating to the consolidation of certain global processes into our shared service center

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow overview 

the following tables summarize key financial data relating to our liquidity capital resources and uses of capital 

 

 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by 2375 during 2008 even after the repurchase of approximately 1910 of our 450 notes during march a component of this change was an increase in marketable securities of 1452 primarily due to the purchase of a time deposit with a maturity greater than ninety days 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities of 8653 for 2008 reflects a significant improvement over 2007 and 2006 the improvement from 2007 to 2008 was driven by improvements in working capital of 3645 and increased net income of 1274 

net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income of 2950 working capital cash generation of 1935 and net noncash expense items of 4030 net noncash expense items primarily include depreciation and amortization of fixed assets amortization of intangible assets restricted stock awards noncash compensation and bond discounts and deferred financing costs 

cash from changes in working capital reflects changes in accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients prepaid expenses and other current assets accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2008 we generated cash from working capital of 1935 compared to a use of 1710 in 2007 and 2506 in 2006 this improvement is primarily due to growth in our businesses and improved working capital management at certain of our operating units 

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow in most of our businesses our agencies enter into commitments to pay production costs and media costs on behalf of clients to the extent possible we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued media and production liabilities our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

  

our accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain other payments for example while cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year 

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities during 2008 includes net purchases of shortterm marketable securities and payments for capital expenditures and acquisitions net purchases of shortterm marketable securities of 1543 primarily relates to a time deposit with a maturity greater than ninety days capital expenditures of 1384 relate to costs associated with leasehold improvements computer hardware and furniture and fixtures payments for acquisitions of 1060 primarily relate to new acquisitions and to a lesser extent deferred payments on prior acquisitions 

financing activities 

in march 2008 holders of approximately 1910 in aggregate principal amount of our 450 notes due 2023 exercised their put option that required us to repurchase their 450 notes payment for the purchased 450 notes was made with available cash in addition cash used in financing activities during 2008 reflects dividend payments of 276 on our series b preferred stock and decreases in shortterm bank borrowings related to our international uncommitted credit facilities 

liquidity outlook 

we generated significant cash from operations in 2008 and ended the year with 22749 in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities based on our cash flow forecasts we expect our cash flow from operations cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months in addition we have backup credit facilities available to support our operating needs our policy is to maintain a conservative approach to liquidity which we believe is appropriate for our company in view of the current conditions in the economy and financial markets in 2008 our lowest monthend total cash and marketable securities balance was 15123 on march 31 st  and our highest monthend total cash and marketable securities balance was 22749 on december 31 st  in 2007 the lowest monthend total cash and marketable securities balance was 14400 on july 31 st  and the highest monthend total cash and marketable securities balance was 20374 on december 31 st  

economic and financial conditions deteriorated sharply in the latter part of 2008 and the current economic conditions are expected to persist throughout 2009 current market conditions may affect the financial condition of some of our clients which can cause a decrease in demand for advertising and marketing services a decrease in revenue should it occur could pose a challenge to our level of cash generation from operations furthermore we have accounts receivable related to revenues earned and for passthrough costs incurred on behalf of our clients as well as expenditures billable to clients related to costs incurred and fees earned that have not yet been billed although we have not experienced a material increase in client defaults and as of december 31 2008 our largest client based on revenue accounted for approximately 4 of our accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients current market conditions increase the likelihood that we could experience future losses 

we maintain committed credit facilities to increase our financial flexibility we have not drawn on any of our corporate credit facilities since 2003 although we use them to obtain letters of credit to support commitments on behalf of certain clients as discussed below under “ — financing and sources of funds — credit facilities” in july 2008 we entered into a 3350 threeyear credit agreement the “2008 credit agreement” this credit facility includes commitments from a syndicate of financial institutions if any of the financial institutions in the syndicate were unable to perform and no other bank assumed that institution’s commitment the total size of the 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued 

amounts in millions except per share amounts 

  

facility would be reduced by the size of that institution’s commitment we also have a 7500 threeyear credit agreement the “2006 credit agreement” that matures in june 2009 we replaced a portion of this facility in july of 2008 with our 2008 credit agreement we do not currently plan on replacing the full amount of the 2006 credit agreement 

if however our business is significantly impacted by further deterioration in the economic environment or otherwise it could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our working capital needs or enhance our financial flexibility our ability to access the capital markets depends on a number of factors which include those specific to us such as our credit rating and those related to the capital markets such as the amount of available credit currently for a noninvestment grade company such as ours the capital markets are challenging with limited available financing at higher costs than in recent years there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

funding requirements 

our most significant funding requirements include our operations noncancelable operating lease obligations acquisitions capital expenditures payments related to vendor discounts and credits debt service preferred stock dividends contributions to pension and postretirement plans and taxes in any twelve month period we maintain substantial flexibility over significant uses of cash including our capital expenditures and cash used for new acquisitions

in july 2008 we entered into the 2008 credit agreement the 2008 credit agreement is a revolving facility under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the 2008 credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 3350 or the equivalent in other currencies and the aggregate available amount of letters of credit outstanding may decrease or increase subject to a limit on letters of credit of 2000 or the equivalent in other currencies our obligations under the 2008 credit agreement are unsecured the terms of the 2008 credit agreement allow us to increase the aggregate lending commitment to a maximum amount of 4850 if lenders agree to the additional commitments in addition the 2008 credit agreement includes covenants that among other things i limit our liens and the liens of our consolidated subsidiaries ii restrict our payments for cash capital expenditures acquisitions common stock dividends share repurchases and certain other purposes and iii limit subsidiary debt 

the 2008 credit agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain on a consolidated basis as of the end of each fiscal quarter i an interest coverage ratio ii a leverage ratio and iii minimum ebitda for the four quarters then ended as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as seen in the table below 

 





 

if we believed we would not be able to comply with these financial covenants in the future we would seek an amendment andor waiver from our lenders but there is no assurance that our lenders would grant an amendment or waiver if we do not comply with these financial covenants and are unable to obtain the necessary amendment or waiver the 2008 credit agreement could be terminated and our lenders could accelerate payments of any outstanding principal in addition under those circumstances we could be required to deposit with one of our lenders funds in an amount equal to any outstanding letters of credit as of december 31 2008 there was no outstanding principal or letters of credit for additional information see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

in june 2006 we entered into the 2006 credit agreement which we can utilize for cash advances and for letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed 7500 outstanding at any time the 2006 credit agreement is a revolving facility under which amounts borrowed by us or any of our subsidiaries designated under the 2006 credit agreement may be repaid and reborrowed subject to an aggregate lending limit of 7500 or the equivalent in other currencies the aggregate face amount of letters of credit may not exceed 6000 at any time our obligations under the 2006 credit agreement are unsecured and we are not subject to any financial or other material restrictive covenants under this facility this facility expires in june of 2009 we have not drawn

we also have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates we use our uncommitted credit lines for working capital needs at some of our operations outside the us and the amount outstanding as of december 31 2008 and 2007 was 788 and 959 respectively we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings made by certain subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some of our international operations the weightedaverage interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted shortterm facilities as of december 31 2008 and 2007 was approximately 3 and 5 respectively 

cash pooling 

we aggregate our net domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the us we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several interpublic agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of overdrafts under all of our pooling arrangements as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the amounts netted were 8587 and 12957 respectively 

debt ratings 

our longterm debt credit ratings as of february 13 2009 were as follows 

 

 the most recent change in our credit ratings occurred on july 9 2008 when moody’s investors service upgraded our outlook from stable to positive a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend amounts in millions 

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates foreign currency rates and certain balance sheet items from time to time we use derivatives pursuant to established guidelines and policies to manage some portion of these risks derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 

interest rates 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair market value of our debt obligations as the majority of our debt approximately 84 as of december 31 2008 bore interest at fixed rates we do have debt with variable interest rates but a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our interest expense or cash flows the fair market value of our debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates and for 2008 this fair market value would decrease by approximately 220 if interest rates were to increase by 10 and would increase by approximately 230 if interest rates were to decrease by 10 for 2007 the fair market value of our debt would decrease by approximately 180 if interest rates were to increase by 10 and would increase by approximately 190 if interest rates were to decrease by 10 we have used interest rate swaps to manage the mix of our fixed and variable rate debt obligations but currently have none outstanding as we terminated our interest rate swap agreement on the 725 senior unsecured notes in september 2008 

foreign currencies 

we face translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations based on 2008 exchange rates and operating results if the us dollar were to strengthen by 10 we currently estimate operating income would decrease between 3 and 5 this assumes that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant from current levels as the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during the period presented for revenues and expenses the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency mitigating transaction risk however certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

credit and market risks 

certain balance sheet items that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash and cash equivalents shortterm marketable securities accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients we invest our excess cash in investmentgrade shortterm securities with financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty concentrations of credit risk with accounts receivable are mitigated by our large number of clients and their dispersion across different industries and geographical areas we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 

  

as of december 31 2008 we held 125 in par value of assetbacked auction rate securities with the liquidity issues experienced in the credit and capital markets worldwide the auctions have failed due to insufficient bids from buyers and as a result we adjusted these securities to a new book value of 67 during 2007 we believe we have the ability and currently intend to hold our auction rate securities until we can recover the full principal we do not believe that the lack of liquidity of these investments will affect our ability to operate our business for additional information see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

as a result of the market decline in 2008 the fair value of our pension plan assets have declined by approximately 12 excluding foreign currency impacts resulting in higher pension expense and funding requirements in 2009 and if unchanged could result in higher pension expense and funding requirements in periods beyond 2009

the interpublic group of companies inc was incorporated in delaware in september 1930 under the name of mccannerickson incorporated as the successor to the advertising agency businesses founded in 1902 by aw erickson and in 1911 by harrison k mccann the company has operated under the interpublic name since january 1961 

 

about us 

 

we are one of the world’s premier advertising and marketing services companies our agency brands deliver custom marketing solutions to many of the world’s largest marketers our companies cover the spectrum of marketing disciplines and specialties from consumer advertising and direct marketing to mobile and search engine marketing 

 

the work we produce for our clients is specific to their unique needs our solutions vary from projectbased activity involving one agency and its client to longterm fullyintegrated campaigns created by a group of our companies working together on behalf of a client with offices in over 100 countries we can operate in a single region or align work globally across all major world markets 

 

the role of the holding company is to provide resources and support to ensure that our agencies can best meet our clients’ needs based in new york city interpublic sets companywide financial objectives and corporate strategy directs collaborative interagency programs establishes financial management and operational controls guides personnel policy conducts investor relations and initiates manages and approves mergers and acquisitions in addition we provide limited centralized functional services that offer our companies operational efficiencies including accounting and finance marketing information retrieval and analysis legal services real estate expertise travel services recruitment aid employee benefits and executive compensation management 

 

to keep our company wellpositioned we support our agencies’ initiatives to expand their highgrowth capabilities and build their offerings in key developing markets when appropriate we also develop relationships with companies that are building leadingedge marketing tools that complement our agencies and the programs they are developing for clients in addition we look for opportunities within our company to modernize operations through mergers strategic alliances and the development of internal programs that encourage intracompany collaboration 

 

market strategy 

 

we have taken several strategic steps in recent years to position our agencies as leaders in the global advertising and communications market we operate in a media landscape that has vastly changed over the last few years media markets continue to fragment and clients face an increasingly complex consumer culture 

 

to stay ahead of these challenges and to achieve our objectives we have invested in creative talent in highgrowth areas and have realigned a number of our capabilities to meet market demand at our mccann worldgroup unit we have continued to invest in talent and in upgrading the group’s integrated marketing services offering at mrm momentum and mccann healthcare we combined accountable marketing and consumer advertising agencies to form the unique global offering draftfcb and at our marketing services group constituency management group “cmg” we continue to strengthen our public relations and events marketing specialists 

 

we have also taken a unique approach to our media offering by aligning our largest media assets with global brand agencies this approach ensures that the ideas we develop for clients work across new media as well as traditional channels in 2007 this differentiated media strategy gained significant traction in the marketplace 

the digital component of our business continues to evolve and is increasingly vital to all of our agencies in order to grow with our clients we have accelerated our investment in talent professional training and technology throughout the organization this reflects our strongly held belief that digital marketing is not a silo instead digital capabilities must reside in all of our assets for example our public relations companies increasingly use blogs and social networking sites to influence consumer opinion while our special events companies use digital kiosks and website surveys to gauge audience response recruiting and developing digitally conversant talent at all our agencies and in all marketing disciplines is therefore a priority and an area where we must be willing to invest strong multichannel talent is vital if we are to continue building longterm relationships with our clients 

 

where necessary we have acquired or built specialty digital assets such as reprise media search engine marketing the interpublic emerging media lab and ansible mobile marketing to meet the changing needs of our clients rga a standalone digital agency is an industry leader in the development of awardwinning interactive campaigns for global clients all of these specialty assets have unique capabilities and serve as key digital partners to many of our agencies within the group 

 

likewise we continue to look for strategic investments that give us a leadership position in emerging markets recent investments in india where we operate three leading agency networks and brazil give our clients a strong foothold in these highgrowth developing markets our partner in russia is the acknowledged advertising leader in the country in china we continue to invest in our existing companies in the market building on our decadeslong commercial history 

 

we believe that our market strategy and offerings can improve our organic revenue growth and operating income margin with our ultimate objective to be fully competitive with our industry peer group on both measures to further improve our operating margin we continue to focus on actively managing staff costs in nonrevenue supporting roles improving financial systems and backoffice processing reducing organizational complexity and rationalizing our portfolio by divesting noncore and underperforming businesses and improving our real estate utilization

interpublic is home to some of the world’s best known and most innovative communications specialists we have three global brands that provide integrated largescale solutions for clients mccann worldgroup “mccann” draftfcb and lowe worldwide “lowe” as well as our domestic integrated agencies and media agencies

interpublic lists approximately 90 companies on our website’s “company finder” tool with descriptions and office locations for each to learn more about our broad range of capabilities visit wwwinterpubliccom information on our website is not part of this report 

 

financial reporting segments 

 

we have two reportable segments integrated agency network “ian” which is comprised of mccann draftfcb and lowe our media agencies and our leading standalone agencies and cmg which is comprised of the bulk of our specialist marketing service offerings we also report results for the “corporate and other” group see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

principal markets 

 

our agencies are located in over 100 countries including every significant world market we provide services for clients whose businesses are broadly international in scope as well as for clients whose businesses are limited to a single country or a small number of countries the us europe excluding the uk the uk asia pacific and latin america represented 557 165 90 89 and 48 of our total revenue respectively in 2007 for further discussion concerning revenues and longlived assets on a geographical basis for each of the last three years see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

sources of revenue 

 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising programs in various media and the planning and execution of other marketing and communications programs most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the basis on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across various agencies in arranging for such services to be provided we may enter into global regional and local agreements 

 

revenues for creation planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative andor quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net 

rate the difference is the commission that we earn which is either retained in total or shared with the client depending on the nature of the services agreement 

 

we pay the media charges with respect to contracts for advertising time or space that we place on behalf of our clients to reduce our risk from a client’s nonpayment we typically pay media charges only after we have received funds from our clients generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor in some instances we agree with the media provider that we will only be liable to pay the media after the client has paid us for the media charges 

 

we also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion event marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

 

our revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our clients and tends to be higher in the second half of the calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the first half as a result of the postholiday slowdown in client activity 

 

 

 

depending on the terms of the client contract fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways proportional performance straightline or monthly basis or completed contract fee revenue recognized on a completed contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at december 31 as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 90 days see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policies 

 

clients 

 

one of the benefits of the holding company structure is that our agencies can work with a variety of clients from competing sectors in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 26 of revenue in 2007 and 2006 based on revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 our largest clients were general motors corporation microsoft johnson  johnson unilever and verizon while the loss of the entire business of any one of our largest clients might have a material adverse effect upon our business we believe that it is unlikely that the entire business of any of these clients would be lost at the same time this is because we represent several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency systems representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to a competing agency and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time 

 

personnel 

 

as of december 31 2007 we employed approximately 43000 persons of whom approximately 19000 were employed in the us because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success there is keen competition for qualified employees

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to the industry in which we operate while others are more specific to us the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us the risks described below may not be the only risks we face additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial could also impair our business operations or financial condition see also statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure 

 

  

since january 2003 the sec has been conducting a formal investigation in response to the restatement we first announced in august 2002 and in 2005 the investigation expanded to encompass the restatement we presented in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2004 that we filed in september 2005 we have also responded to inquiries from the sec staff concerning the restatement of the first three quarters of 2005 that we made in our 2005 annual report on form 10k we continue to cooperate with the investigation we expect that the investigation will result in monetary liability but as settlement discussions have not yet commenced we cannot reasonably estimate the amount range of amounts or timing of a resolution accordingly we have not yet established any provision relating to these matters 

 

the sec staff has informed us that it intends to seek approval from the commission to enter into settlement discussions with us or failing a settlement to litigate an action charging the company with various violations of the federal securities laws in that connection and as previously disclosed in our current report on form 8k filed june 14 2007 the staff sent us a “wells notice” which invited us to make a responsive submission before the staff makes a final determination concerning its recommendation to the commission we expect to discuss settlement with the staff once the commission authorizes the staff to engage in such discussions we cannot at this time predict what the commission will authorize or the outcome of any settlement negotiations 

 

  

the marketing communications business is highly competitive our agencies and media services must compete with other agencies and with other providers of creative or media services in order to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients our competitors include not only other large multinational advertising and marketing communications companies but also smaller entities that operate in local or regional markets new market participants include systems integrators database marketing and modeling companies telemarketers and internet companies 

 

the client’s perception of the quality of an agency’s creative work our reputation and the agencies’ reputations are important factors in determining our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis is also an important competitive consideration on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 26 of revenue in 2007 while we believe it unlikely that we would lose the entire business of any one of our largest clients at the same time a substantial decline in such a client’s advertising and marketing spending or the loss of its entire business could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations 

 

our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

 

  

employees including creative research media account and practice group specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most important assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and could be adversely affected by our recent financial or market performance 

 

  

economic downturns often more severely affect the marketing services industry than other industries in the past some clients have responded to weak economic performance in any region where we operate by reducing their marketing budgets which are generally discretionary in nature and easier to reduce in the shortterm than other expenses related to operations this pattern may recur in the future 

 

  

our longterm debt is currently rated ba3 with stable outlook by moody’s b with positive outlook by standard and poor’s and bb with stable outlook by fitch any ratings downgrades or comparatively weak ratings can adversely affect us because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness including covenants and interest rates our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have an adverse effect on our liquidity 

 

  

in previous years we have experienced operating losses and weak operating cash flow until our margins consistently improve in connection with our turnaround cash generation from operations could be challenged in certain periods this could have a negative impact on our liquidity in future years and could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our working capital needs there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we were unable to do so our liquidity position could be adversely affected 

 

  

we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial distress file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business if any client with whom we have a substantial amount of business experiences financial difficulty it could delay or jeopardize the collection of accounts receivable may result in significant reductions in services provided by us and may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity for a description of our client base see item 1 business — clients 

  

international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues approximately 44 in 2007 our international operations are exposed to risks that affect foreign operations of all kinds including local legislation monetary devaluation exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries in addition because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the euro pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real japanese yen and south african rand fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results 

 

  

we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and fixed assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability at least annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment or lack of realizability if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance in the past we have recorded substantial amounts of goodwill investment and other impairment charges and have been required to establish substantial valuation allowances with respect to deferred tax assets and loss carryforwards 

 

as of december 31 2007 we have substantial amounts of longlived assets investments and deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet future events including our financial performance and strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that further impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets investments and deferred tax assets may have become impaired any resulting impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized 

 

  

from time to time we communicate to the public certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance including but not limited to the areas of revenue and operating margin growth these targets and milestones are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance but they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them see “statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure” 

 

  

our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign there has been an increasing tendency on the part of advertisers and consumer groups to challenge advertising through legislation regulation the courts or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare through the years there has been a continuing expansion of specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products representatives within government bodies both domestic and foreign continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently our revenues

executive summary 

 

we are one of the world’s premier advertising and marketing services companies our agency brands deliver custom marketing solutions to many of the world’s largest marketers our companies cover the spectrum of marketing disciplines and specialties from consumer advertising and direct marketing to mobile and search engine marketing major global brands include draftfcb futurebrand golinharris international initiative jack morton worldwide lowe worldwide “lowe” magna global mccann erickson momentum mrm octagon universal mccann and weber shandwick leading domestic brands include campbellewald carmichael lynch deutsch hill holliday mullen and the martin agency 

 

the work we produce for our clients is specific to their unique needs our solutions vary from projectbased activity involving one agency and its client to longterm fullyintegrated campaigns created by a group of our companies working together on behalf of a client with offices in over 100 countries we can operate in a single region or align work globally across all major world markets our revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our clients and tends to be higher in the second half of the calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the first half as a result of the postholiday slowdown in client activity 

 

our strategy is focused on improving our organic revenue growth and operating income we are working to achieve significant improvements in our organic revenue growth and operating margins with our ultimate objective to be fully competitive with our industry peer group on both measures 

 

we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance by determining the portion of the change that is attributable to foreign currency rates and the change attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures with the remainder considered the organic change for purposes of analyzing this change acquisitions and divestitures are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred 

 

we have strategically realigned a number of our capabilities to promote revenue growth for example we have combined accountable marketing and consumer advertising to form the global offering draftfcb and 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

implemented a differentiated approach to media by aligning our largest media assets with our global brand agencies we continue to develop our capacity in strategically critical areas notably digital marketing services and media that we expect will drive future revenue growth the digital component of our business continues to evolve and is increasingly vital to all of our agencies in order to grow with our clients we have accelerated our investment in talent professional development and technology throughout the organization 

 

to further improve our operating margin we continue to focus on the following areas 

 

  

although the us dollar is our reporting currency a substantial portion of our revenues is generated in foreign currencies therefore our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the currencies in which we conduct our international businesses the weakening of the us dollar against the currencies of many countries in which we operate contributed to higher revenues and operating expenses in particular during 2007 and 2006 the us dollar was weaker against the euro pound sterling brazilian real and canadian dollar compared to 2006 and 2005 respectively the 2007 impact was also due to the strength of the australian dollar compared to 2006 the average value of the euro and pound sterling currencies in which the majority of our international operations are conducted each strengthened approximately 9 against the us dollar during 2007 foreign currency variations resulted in increases of approximately 3 in revenues salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses in 2007 compared to 2006

critical accounting estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying financial statements and notes we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our financial statements management has discussed with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

revenue recognition 

 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising programs in various media and the planning and execution of other marketing and communications programs most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the bases on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across various agencies in arranging for such services to be provided it is possible for a global regional and local agreement to be initiated multiple agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements 

 

revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the price is fixed or determinable iii collectibility is reasonably assured and iv services have been performed depending on the terms of a client contract fees for services performed can be recognized in three principal ways proportional performance straightline or monthly basis or completed contract see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

depending on the terms of the client contract revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed commissions performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of the revenue to our performance relative to both qualitative and quantitative goals performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client the classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments if the judgments change there can be a material impact on our financial statements and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods incremental direct costs incurred related to contracts where revenue is accounted for on a completed contract basis are generally expensed as incurred there are certain exceptions made for significant contracts or for certain agencies where the majority of the contracts are projectbased and systems are in place to properly capture appropriate direct costs 

 

substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less passthrough expenses charged to a client in most cases the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our financial statements because of various passthrough expenses such as production and media costs in compliance with emerging issues task force “eitf” issue 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

no 9919 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  we assess whether our agency or the thirdparty supplier is the primary obligor we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment in addition we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor because we operate broadly as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting accordingly we generally record revenue net of passthrough charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business in those businesses primarily sales promotion event sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as office and general expenses revenue is reported net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenueproducing transactions 

 

the determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves complex judgments if we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our financial performance if it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues have no impact on our operating income and have an adverse impact on operating margin 

 

we receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that based on the terms of our contracts and local law are either remitted to our clients or retained by us if amounts are to be passed through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or if retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned negotiations with a client at the close of a current engagement could result in either payments to the client in excess of the contractual liability or in payments less than the contractual liability these items referred to as concessions relate directly to the operations of the period and are recorded as operating expense or income concession income or expense may also be realized in connection with settling vendor discount or credit liabilities that were established as part of the restatement we presented in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2004 that we filed in september 2005 the “2004 restatement” in these situations and given the historical nature of these liabilities we have recorded such items as other income or expense in order to prevent distortion of current operating results see notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas 123r” sfas 123r requires compensation costs related to sharebased transactions including employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value compensation cost is generally recognized ratably over the requisite service period net of estimated forfeitures 

 

we use the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted which requires the input of subjective assumptions including the option’s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value and our results of operations could be materially impacted the expected volatility factor is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of our tradable forward put and call options to purchase and sell shares of our common stock the expected term is based on the average of an assumption that outstanding options are exercised upon achieving their full vesting date and will be exercised at the midpoint between the current date ie the date awards have been ratably vested through and their full contractual term additionally we calculate an estimated forfeiture rate which impacts our recorded expense see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

income taxes 

 

the provision for income taxes includes federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes 

 

under sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes “sfas 109”  we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets the realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings sfas 109 requires that a valuation allowance be recognized when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized in circumstances where there is significant negative evidence establishment of valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence under the provisions of sfas 109 a pattern of sustained profitability is considered significant positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our future earnings 

 

on january 1 2007 we adopted fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes “fin 48” which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return additionally fin 48 provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition the assessment of recognition and measurement requires critical estimates and the use of complex judgments we evaluate our tax positions using a “more likely than not” recognition threshold and then we apply a measurement assessment to those positions that meet the recognition threshold we have established tax reserves that we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments in each of the jurisdictions in which we are subject to taxation we regularly assess the likelihood of additional tax assessments in those jurisdictions and adjust our reserves as additional information or events require see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

we account for our business combinations using the purchase accounting method the total costs of the acquisitions are allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair market values and the remainder allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets determining the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill 

 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization during the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we have 15 reporting units subject to the 2007 annual impairment testing that are either the entities at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level in accordance with sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” we did not test certain reporting units in 2007 as we determined we could carry forward the fair value of the reporting unit from the previous year 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives generally between 7 and 15 years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

 

sfas 142 specifies a twostep process for goodwill impairment testing and measuring the magnitude of any impairment the first step of the impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the first step of the impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step the second step is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

 

the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using traditional valuation techniques such as the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earning and revenue multiples these techniques use projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions as to matters such as future revenue growth profit margins capital expenditures assumed tax rates and discount rates we believe that the estimates and assumptions made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period for example our strategic decisions or changes in market valuation multiples could lead to impairment charges actual results of operations cash flows and other factors used in a discounted cash flow valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material 

 

our annual impairment reviews as of october 1 2007 did not result in an impairment charge at any of our reporting units in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit at the low end of the valuation range the following tables show the number of reporting units we tested in our 2007 and 2006 annual impairment reviews together with the range of values we obtained for the excess of fair value over carrying value of each nonimpaired reporting unit determined by using fair values for each unit a at the low end of our valuation range b at the high end of our valuation range and c 10 below the low end of our valuation range 

 

 

 

applying the hypothetical 10 decrease in 2007 to the fair values would result in 3 reporting units failing step one of the goodwill impairment test 

 

pension and postretirement benefits 

 

we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations these assumptions include discount rates and expected returns on plan assets and are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events changes in the related pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

the discount rate is one of the significant assumptions that impact our net pension and postretirement costs and obligations changes in the discount rates are generally due to increases or decreases in longterm interest rates a higher discount rate will decrease our pension cost the discount rates are determined at the beginning of the year based on prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date and are adjusted to match the duration of the underlying obligation for 2008 we plan to use weighted average discount rates of 589 533 and 600 for the domestic pension plans foreign plans and the postretirement plan respectively a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2007 net pension and postretirement cost by 24 and 25 respectively in addition a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the december 31 2007 benefit obligation by 225 and 238 respectively 

 

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year changes in the rates are due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held for 2008 we plan to use weighted average expected rates of return of 815 and 702 for the domestic and foreign pension plans respectively a lower expected rate of return will increase our net pension cost a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2007 net pension cost by 10 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

results of operations 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 

revenue 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

 

 

our revenue increased by 3634 which consisted of a favorable foreign currency rate impact of 1975 net divestitures of 707 and organic revenue growth of 2366 the change in revenues was negatively affected by net divestitures of nonstrategic businesses primarily at draftfcb and lowe and a sports marketing business at the constituency management group “cmg” this was partially offset by businesses acquired during 2007 primarily in the us and india the organic revenue growth was primarily driven by domestic markets through expanding business with existing clients winning new clients in advertising and public relations and completing several projects within the events marketing business the international organic revenue increase was primarily driven by increases in spending by existing clients in the asia pacific region partially offset by net client losses in continental europe primarily in france at the integrated agency network “ian” 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

 

 

revenue decreased due to net divestitures partially offset by organic revenue increases and changes in foreign currency exchange rates net divestitures primarily impacted ian largely from draftfcb and mccann worldgroup “mccann” during 2005 there were net organic revenue increases in both our international and domestic locations the international organic increase was driven by higher revenue from existing clients primarily in the asia pacific and latin america regions partially offset by net client losses primarily in 2005 at ian as well as decreases in the events marketing businesses at cmg in the uk the domestic organic increase was primarily driven by growth in the public relations and branding businesses at cmg as well as higher revenue from existing clients partially offset by net client losses and decreased client spending at ian 

 

operating expenses 

 

 

 

salaries and related expenses 

 

salaries and related expenses is the largest component of operating expenses and consist of payroll costs employee performance incentives including cash bonus and longterm incentive stock awards and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with shortterm changes in revenue levels however salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of hiring freelance contractors who are utilized to support business development changes in the funding levels of employee performance incentives changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions and dispositions of businesses changes can occur in employee performance incentives based on 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

projected results and could affect trends between various periods in the future in addition longterm incentive stock awards may fluctuate as they are tied to our financial performance generally for threeyear periods beginning with the grant year with the achievement of performance targets required for these awards our financial performance over the past few years has lagged behind that of our peers primarily due to lower revenue and operating margin growth as a result salaries and related expenses reflect significant severance charges and investments in hiring creative talent to realign the business for revenue growth and improved operating margins also salaries and related expenses reflect the hiring of additional finance professionals and information technology staff to upgrade system infrastructure and to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment as well as to develop shared services 

 

 

 

the following table details our salary and related expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenue 

 

 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

salaries and related expenses increased by 1951 which consisted of a negative foreign currency rate impact of 1222 net divestitures of 325 and an organic salary increase of 1054 net divestitures related primarily to the disposition of nonstrategic businesses offset in part by acquisitions of businesses primarily in the us and india the organic increase was primarily due to the following 

 

  

these increases were offset by a decrease in severance expense of 224 during 2007 primarily in ian 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

salaries and related expenses decreased during 2006 due to net divestitures primarily from the sale of several businesses at ian during 2005 partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and an organic increase total salaries and related expenses as a percentage of revenue remained flat as a result of the decline in revenue key factors behind the organic increase in salaries and related expenses from the prior year 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

were an increase in longterm incentive awards and bonus awards of 676 offset by a significant reduction in severance expense of 636 expenses related to incentive awards increased in 2006 due to longterm equity based awards granted in june 2006 and the full year impact of awards granted in august 2005 while expenses related to bonus awards increased primarily due to performance 

 

office and general expenses 

 

office and general expenses primarily include rent expense professional fees expenses attributable to the support of client service professional staff depreciation and amortization costs bad debt expense relating to accounts receivable the costs associated with the development of a shared services center and implementation costs associated with upgrading our information technology infrastructure office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements these costs include outofpocket costs such as travel for client service professional staff production costs and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients 

 

 

 

the following table details our office and general expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenue all other office and general expenses includes production expenses depreciation and amortization bad debt expense foreign currency gains losses and other expenses 

 

 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

office and general expenses decreased by 342 which consisted of a negative foreign currency rate impact of 660 net divestitures of 438 and an organic decrease of 564 net divestitures related primarily to the disposition of nonstrategic businesses offset in part by acquisitions of businesses primarily in the us and india the organic decrease was primarily due to the following 

 

  

these decreases were partially offset by an increase in production expenses of 342 primarily related to increased business at the events marketing business at cmg 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

office and general expenses for 2006 declined as a result of significant reductions in professional fees which decreased by 937 primarily for projects related to our restatement activities and internal control compliance that occurred in 2005 lower production expenses lower bad debt expenses and net divestitures primarily due to the sale of several businesses at ian during 2005 partially offsetting this decrease were 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

higher rent expense and a reduction in foreign exchange gains on certain balance sheet items the above items resulted in an organic decline which was primarily reflected at corporate and ian 

 

restructuring and other reorganizationrelated charges reversals 

 

the components of restructuring and other reorganizationrelated charges reversals were as follows 

 

 

 

restructuring charges reversals 

 

restructuring charges reversals related to the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs and a restructuring program entered into at lowe during the third quarter of 2007 due to changes in the business environment that have occurred during the year we committed to and began implementing a restructuring program to realign resources with our strategic business objectives within lowe this plan includes reducing and restructuring lowe’s workforce both domestically and internationally and terminating certain lease agreements for this plan we recognized charges related to severance and termination costs of 145 and expense related to lease termination and other exit costs of 46 during the year ended december 31 2007 we expect to incur additional charges related to this program of approximately 40 in the first half of 2008 cash payments are expected to be made through december 31 2009 

 

offsetting the severance and termination costs incurred at lowe were adjustments to estimates relating to our prior severance and termination related actions offsetting the lease termination and other exit costs incurred at lowe were reversals related to the utilization of previously vacated property by a draftfcb agency and adjustments to estimates relating to our prior year plans 

 

during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 net lease termination and other exit costs were primarily related to adjustments to management’s estimates as a result of changes in sublease rental income assumptions and utilization of previously vacated properties relating to the 2003 program by certain of our agencies due to improved economic conditions in certain markets 

 

other reorganizationrelated charges 

 

other reorganizationrelated charges relate to strategic business decisions made during 2007 and 2006 our realignment of our media businesses and the 2006 merger of draft worldwide and foote cone and belding worldwide to create draftfcb charges in 2007 and 2006 primarily related to severance and terminations costs and lease termination and other exit costs we expect charges associated with the realignment of our media businesses in 2007 to be completed during 2008 charges related to the creation of draftfcb in 2006 are complete the charges were separated from our operating expenses within the consolidated statements of operations as they did not result from charges that occurred in the normal course of business 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

longlived asset impairment and other charges 

 

longlived assets include furniture equipment leasehold improvements goodwill and other intangible assets longlived assets with finite lives are generally depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their respective estimated useful lives when necessary we record an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the implied fair value no impairment charges were recorded for 2007 

 

the following table summarizes longlived asset impairment and other charges in previous years 

 

 

 

 

our longterm projections which were updated in the fourth quarter of 2006 showed previously unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows due primarily to client losses at one of our domestic advertising reporting units these discounted future operating cash flow projections indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill at this reporting unit was less than its book value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of 272 

 

 

a triggering event occurred subsequent to our 2005 annual impairment test when a major client was lost by lowe’s london agency and the possibility of losing other clients was considered a higher risk due to management defections and changes in the competitive landscape this caused projected revenue growth to decline as a result of these changes our longterm projections showed declines in discounted future operating cash flows these revised cash flows indicated that the implied fair value of lowe’s goodwill was less than the related book value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of 910 at our lowe reporting unit 

 

during our annual impairment test in the third quarter of 2005 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 58 at a reporting unit within our sports and entertainment marketing business the longterm projections showed previously unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows and as a result these discounted future operating cash flows indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the related book value

net interest expense 

 

the increase in net interest expense during 2007 is primarily attributable to higher cash interest expense on increased shortterm debt partially offset by increased interest income due to higher average cash balances and higher interest rates at some of our international agencies the change in noncash amortization from the prior year was minimal noncash amortization primarily consists of amortization of debt issuance costs and deferred warrant costs from a transaction in 2006 which we refer to as the “elf financing” in connection with entering into our current committed credit agreement partially offset by reduced expense related to the amortization of the loss on extinguishment of 4000 of our 450 convertible senior notes for additional information see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

the increase in net interest expense during 2006 was primarily due to increases in noncash amortization of 273 offset by interest income due to an increase in interest rates and higher average cash balances compared to the prior year noncash amortization was primarily from the amortization of fees and deferred warrant costs incurred as a result of the elf financing transaction prior year benefit from the amortization of gains on terminated swaps and the amortization of the remaining costs associated with our previous committed credit agreement additionally the increase was due to onetime fees associated with the exchange of our floating rate notes in 2006 the 2006 yearoveryear comparison benefited from the fact that we did not incur waiver and consent fees similar to those incurred in 2005 for the amendment of the indentures governing our debt securities and our prior credit facility

other income 

 

  

income taxes 

 

 

 

in 2007 our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by foreign profits subject to tax at different rates and by losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances our effective tax rate was positively impacted in 2007 by the release of tax reserves resulting from the effective settlement of the irs examination for 20032004 and by the net reversal of valuation allowances certain tax law changes also impacted the effective tax rate which resulted in the writedown of net deferred tax assets of 162 primarily in certain nonus jurisdictions and to a lesser extent certain us states 

 

the effective settlement of the irs examination referred to above resulted in the realization of previously unrecognized tax benefits of which approximately 800 was attributable to certain worthless securities deductions the favorable impact of this item and other net reserve releases are primary reasons for the change in the effective tax rate compared to 2006 

 

the tax provision for 2006 was primarily impacted by domestic losses foreign profits subject to tax at different rates and losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances 

 

the tax provision for 2005 was primarily impacted by an increase in valuation allowances a nondeductible asset impairment state and local taxes and the resolution of various income tax audits and issues 

 

during 2007 we had a net reversal of valuation allowances of 490 of which 305 relates to the writedown of deferred tax assets due to tax law changes in jurisdictions with existing valuation allowances and 185 relates to reversals of valuation allowances in various countries where we believe that it is now more likely than not that the corresponding tax loss carryforwards will be utilized during 2006 and 2005 we had net provisions for valuation allowances of 636 and 699 respectively recorded in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets current year tax losses and temporary differences the total valuation allowance as of december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 was 4816 5040 and 5010 respectively

revenue 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

 

 

the revenue increase in 2007 was a result of net changes in foreign currency exchange rates and organic revenue increases partially offset by net divestitures the domestic organic increase was a result of higher revenue from existing clients and net client wins primarily at mccann and hill holliday partially offsetting this domestic organic increase was decreased revenue from existing clients at lowe and net client losses at draftfcb the international organic increase was due to increases in client spending at mccann in the uk and asia pacific partially offset by net client losses at draftfcb and lowe across most international regions net divestitures negatively affected revenue due to the sale of nonstrategic businesses in 2007 and 2006 primarily at draftfcb and lowe partially offset by businesses acquired primarily at lowe 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

 

 

the revenue decline in 2006 was a result of net divestitures primarily from the sale of several businesses at draftfcb and mccann in 2005 partially offset by an organic increase and changes in foreign currency exchange rates the organic increase was driven primarily by mccann and draftfcb partially offset by decreases at lowe and the works one of our independent agencies the organic increase at mccann was the result of higher revenue from existing clients across domestic and international regions primarily asia pacific and latin america mccann’s increase was primarily driven by digital direct and event marketing services the increase at draftfcb was primarily the result of increased spending from existing clients partially offset by net client losses primarily in 2005 across domestic and most international regions primarily europe asia pacific and latin america the decrease at lowe was primarily due to reduced spending by existing clients and net client losses primarily in domestic locations in 2005 the revenue decrease at the works a dedicated general motors resource was primarily due to the loss of the general motors us media buying business in 2005

segment operating income 

 

 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

operating income increased due to an increase in revenue of 2751 partially offset by increases in salaries and related expenses of 1229 and office and general expenses of 154 higher salaries and related expenses were primarily due to an increase in base salaries benefits and temporary help of 1312 to support growth primarily at mccann the increase in office and general expenses was due to shared service expenses which were not allocated in prior years and the increased allocation of technology expenses from corporate partially offset by lower occupancy costs primarily due to lease termination and other exit costs related to facilities exited in 2006 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

operating income increased during 2006 due to a decrease in office and general expenses of 1397 a decrease in salaries and related expenses of 992 partially offset by a decrease in revenue of 972 the reduction in office and general expenses primarily related to a decrease in production expenses of 464 a reduction in professional fees of 263 in connection with accounting projects such as those related to our restatement activities and a decrease in bad debt expense of 222 the reduction in salaries and related expenses primarily related to a reduction in severance expense of 631 for headcount reductions that occurred in international locations in 2005 and a decrease in salaries of 420

revenue 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

 

 

revenue growth was a result of organic increases and net changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by net divestitures the domestic organic revenue increase was primarily due to client wins and expanding business with existing clients in the public relations business the completion of several projects with existing clients in the events marketing business and expanding business with existing clients in the sports marketing business revenues in the events marketing business can fluctuate due to timing of completed projects as revenue is typically recognized when the project is complete furthermore we generally act as principal for these projects and as such record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as passthrough costs in office and general expenses the international organic revenue increase was primarily from existing clients in the public relations business in europe and the asia pacific region the international revenue increase was partially offset by decreased revenues from existing clients in europe primarily due to projectbased events in 2006 that did not recur in 2007 related to the sports marketing business net divestitures primarily relate to a sports marketing business sold in 2006 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

 

 

revenue growth was a result of domestic organic revenue increases in the public relations and branding businesses which was due to higher revenue from existing clients additionally there were organic revenue increases domestically in the sports marketing and events marketing businesses due to higher revenue from existing clients and client wins the domestic increase was partially offset by declines at some cmg agencies due to client losses internationally the decline related primarily to a decrease in the events marketing and sports marketing businesses caused by client losses the international decrease was partially offset by increases in the public relations and branding businesses due to higher revenue from existing clients 

 

segment operating income 

 

 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

operating income increased primarily due to an increase in revenue of 883 partially offset by increases in office and general expenses of 461 and salaries and related expenses of 359 salaries and related expenses increased primarily due to an increase in salaries of 284 related to the hiring of additional staff in the public relations business to support revenue growth office and general expenses increased primarily due to higher production expenses of 320 related to the completion of several projects in the events marketing business and higher occupancy costs primarily due to lease termination charges and accelerated depreciation and amortization related to certain leasehold improvements in facilities exited in 2007 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

operating income decreased slightly primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and related expenses of 320 partially offset by a decrease in office and general expenses of 146 and an increase in revenue of 160 the increase in salaries and related expenses primarily related to an increase in base salaries expense of 223 and the decrease in office and general expenses primarily related to a decrease in production expenses of 198 

 

corporate and other 

 

certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line item within total segment operating income loss and include corporate office expenses and shared service center expenses as well as certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions salaries and related expenses include salaries longterm incentives bonus and other miscellaneous benefits for corporate office employees office and general expenses primarily includes professional fees related to internal control compliance financial statement audits legal information technology and other consulting services which are 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

engaged and managed through the corporate office in addition office and general expenses also includes rental expense and depreciation of leasehold improvements for properties occupied by corporate office employees offsetting these expenses are amounts we allocate to operating divisions based on a formula that uses the revenues of each of the operating units amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technologyrelated projects which are allocated based on utilization 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

corporate and other expenses decreased by 594 to 2159 for the year ended december 31 2007 this was primarily driven by improvements in our financial systems backoffice processes and internal controls which resulted in a reduction in professional fees partially offsetting this reduction were higher salaries and related expenses primarily related to longterm incentive award accruals for a onetime performancebased equity award granted in 2006 to a limited number of senior executives across the company and the transfer of resources into a global finance organization as part of a regional monitoring program in addition amounts allocated to operating divisions increased primarily due to the charging of shared services expenses that were not previously allocated as well as for costs relating to the consolidation of certain global processes into our shared service center 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

corporate and other expenses decreased by 410 to 2753 for the year ended december 31 2006 expenses decreased primarily due to reduced professional fees and higher amounts allocated to operating divisions partially offset by higher rent depreciation and amortization and increased salaries and related expenses we incurred lower professional fees for accounting projects which included those related to our prioryear restatement activities amounts allocated to operating divisions increased primarily due to the implementation of new information technologyrelated projects the consolidation of information technology support staff and the allocation of audit fees which are now being allocated back to operating divisions higher rent depreciation and amortization were due to softwarerelated costs from our ongoing initiatives to consolidate and upgrade our financial systems as well as to further develop our shared services salaries and related expenses increased due to higher headcount primarily related to our technology initiatives and for larger incentive compensation and bonus awards related to performance 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flow overview 

 

 

 

 

 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities increased by 803 during 2007 primarily due to improved operating results and proceeds from the sale of businesses and investments partially offset by 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

working capital usage acquisitions including deferred payments and capital expenditures of this change marketable securities increased by 211 

 

operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities of 2981 reflects a significant improvement compared to both 2006 and 2005 the increase was primarily due to net income of 1676 which includes net noncash expense items of 3161 partially offset by working capital usage of 1710 net noncash expense items primarily include depreciation of fixed assets the amortization of intangible assets restricted stock awards noncash compensation bond discounts and deferred financing costs and deferred taxes 

 

during 2007 working capital improved to a use of working capital of 1710 compared to the use of working capital of 2506 during 2006 working capital usage reflects changes in accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients prepaid expenses and other current assets accounts payable and accrued liabilities the working capital usage was impacted by the timing of certain vendor payments and cash collections from clients the reversal payment or settlement of various prior period liabilities that were established during the 2004 restatement and the resolution of various tax matters as we continue to strengthen our business operations we anticipate that working capital will improve 

 

the timing of media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow in most of our businesses we collect funds from our clients that we use on their behalf to pay production costs and media costs the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily affect the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued media and production liabilities our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers generally we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients and our risk from client nonpayment has historically not been significant 

 

in addition to the timing of accrued media and production accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain payments for example while cash incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year 

 

investing activities 

 

cash used in investing activities during 2007 primarily reflects acquisitions and capital expenditures partially offset by proceeds from sales of investments payments for acquisitions relate to purchases of agencies and deferred payments on prior acquisitions during 2007 we made a number of acquisitions for total cash consideration of 1404 under the contractual terms of certain of our prior acquisitions we made cash payments of 175 for the year ended december 31 2007 for additional information see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements capital expenditures of 1476 primarily related to costs associated with leasehold improvements and computer hardware 

 

financing activities 

 

cash used in financing activities during 2007 primarily reflects dividend payments of 276 on our series b preferred stock and distributions to our minority interests 

 

liquidity outlook 

 

we expect our operating cash flow cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months we believe that a conservative approach to liquidity is appropriate for our company in view of the cash requirements resulting from among other things 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

liabilities to our clients for vendor discounts and credits any potential penalties or fines that may have to be paid in connection with the ongoing sec investigation the normal cash variability inherent in our operations other unanticipated requirements and our funding requirements noted below in addition until our margins consistently improve in connection with our turnaround cash generation from operations could be challenged in certain periods 

 

a reduction in our liquidity in future periods could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our working capital needs from time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional financing or otherwise improve our liquidity profile and enhance our financial flexibility there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

 

funding requirements 

 

our most significant funding requirements include our operations noncancelable operating lease obligations acquisitions capital expenditures payments related to vendor discounts and credits debt service preferred stock dividends contributions to pension and postretirement plans and taxes 

 

  

contractual obligations 

 

the following summarizes our estimated contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

  

regular quarterly dividends on our series b preferred stock are 69 or 276 annually for additional information see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the contractual obligations table our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plans’ funded status the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets level of market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans for the year ended december 31 2007 we made contributions of 301 to our foreign pension plans but did not contribute to our domestic pension plans for 2008 we do not expect to contribute to our domestic pension plans and expect to contribute 247 to our foreign pension plans 

 

financing and sources of funds 

 

substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies our liquid assets are held primarily at the holding company level and to a lesser extent at our largest subsidiaries 

 

since 2006 we have engaged in several transactions to improve our liquidity and debt maturity profile 

 

  

credit facilities 

 

under our principal credit facility the credit agreement a specialpurpose entity called elf special financing ltd “elf” acts as the lender and letter of credit issuer elf is obligated at our request to make 

 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

cash advances to us and to issue letters of credit for our account in an aggregate amount not to exceed 7500 outstanding at any time the aggregate face amount of letters of credit may not exceed 6000 at any time our obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured the credit agreement is a revolving facility under which amounts borrowed may be repaid and borrowed again and the aggregate available amount of letters of credit may decrease or increase subject to the overall limit of 7500 and the 6000 limit on letters of credit we have not drawn on this facility to date or on our previous committed credit agreements since late 2003 we are not subject to any financial or other material restrictive covenants under this facility for additional information see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

in addition to the credit agreement we have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates we use our uncommitted credit lines for working capital needs at some of our operations outside the us there were borrowings under the uncommitted facilities made by several of our subsidiaries outside the us totaling 959 and 803 as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings by our subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some overseas operations the weightedaverage interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted shortterm facilities as of december 31 2007 and 2006 was approximately 5 

 

letters of credit 

 

we are required from time to time to post letters of credit primarily to support our commitments or those of our subsidiaries to purchase media placements mostly in locations outside the us or to satisfy other obligations these letters of credit are generally backed by letters of credit issued under the credit agreement the aggregate amount of outstanding letters of credit issued for our account under the credit agreement was 2229 and 2199 as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively these letters of credit have historically not been drawn upon 

 

cash pooling 

 

we aggregate our net domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the us we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several interpublic agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of overdrafts for each pooling arrangement as of december 31 2007 and 2006 a gross amount of 12957 and 10525 respectively in cash was netted against an equal gross amount of overdrafts under pooling arrangements 

 

debt ratings 

 

our longterm debt credit ratings as of february 15 2008 were ba3 with stable outlook b with positive outlook and bb with stable outlook as reported by moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings respectively a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning credit rating agency the rating of each credit rating agency should be evaluated independently of any other rating

other matters 

 

sec investigation 

 

since january 2003 the sec has been conducting a formal investigation in response to the restatement we first announced in august 2002 and in 2005 the investigation expanded to encompass the 2004 restatement we have also responded to inquiries from the sec staff the “staff” concerning the restatement of the first three quarters of 2005 that we made in our 2005 annual report on form 10k we continue to cooperate with the investigation we expect that the investigation will result in monetary liability but as settlement discussions have not yet commenced we cannot reasonably estimate the amount range of amounts or timing of a resolution accordingly we have not yet established any provision relating to these matters 

 

the staff has informed us that it intends to seek approval from the commission to enter into settlement discussions with us or failing a settlement to litigate an action charging the company with various violations of the federal securities laws in that connection and as previously disclosed by the company in a current report on form 8k filed june 14 2007 the staff sent the company a “wells notice” which invited us to make a responsive submission before the staff makes a final determination concerning its recommendation to the commission we expect to discuss settlement with the staff once the commission authorizes the staff to engage in such discussions we cannot at this time predict what the commission will authorize or the outcome of any settlement negotiations 

 

2006 outofperiod amounts 

 

during 2006 we recorded adjustments to certain vendor discounts and credits contractual liabilities foreign exchange tax and other miscellaneous items which related to prior periods for the year ended december 31 2006 these adjustments resulted in a net favorable impact to revenue of 61 a net favorable impact to salaries and related expenses of 56 a net unfavorable impact to office and general expenses of 65 and a net favorable impact to net loss of 45 the operating income impact of these adjustments primarily affected our ian segment because these changes are not material to our financial statements for the periods prior to 2006 for the quarters of 2006 or for 2006 as a whole we recorded these outofperiod amounts in their respective quarters of 2006 see also note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates and foreign currency rates from time to time we use derivatives pursuant to established guidelines and policies to manage some portion of these risks derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 

 

interest rates 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations as of december 31 2007 and 2006 approximately 85 of our debt obligations bore interest at fixed interest rates accordingly assuming the fixedrate debt is not refinanced there would be no impact on interest expense or cash flow from either a 10 increase or decrease in market rates of interest however there would be an impact on the fair market value of the debt as the fair market value of debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates for 2007 the fair market value of the debt obligations would decrease by 184 if market rates were to increase by 10 and would increase by 194 if market rates were to decrease by 10 for 2006 the fair market value of the debt obligations would decrease by 288 if market rates were to increase by 10 and would increase by 295 if market rates were to decrease by 10 for that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable rates based on outstanding amounts and rates as of december 31 2007 and 2006 net interest expense and cash outflow would increase or decrease by approximately 20 in each year if market rates were to increase or decrease by 10 interest rate swaps have been used to manage the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt obligations however we currently have none outstanding 

 

foreign currencies 

 

we face translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheets our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the us dollar mitigating transaction risk since the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency foreign currency translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a component of stockholders’ equity and does not impact operating results since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in results of operations and were not significant in the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

 

derivatives 

 

the terms of the 450 notes include two embedded derivative instruments and the terms of our 475 notes 425 notes and our series b preferred stock each include one embedded derivative instrument the fair value of these derivatives on december 31 2007 was negligible in addition we have entered into operating leases in a foreign country with payments that are payable in the us dollar or its equivalent dollar value in that country’s currency and future rent increases are based on the us inflation rate according to the consumer price index as such these leases contain an embedded foreign currency derivative and we have recorded a longterm asset on our consolidated balance sheets the changes in value of this asset which are negligible have been recorded as other income or expense in our consolidated statements of operations

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting located in item 8 is incorporated by reference herein 

 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

 

in connection with the preparation of this annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2007 we have carried out an evaluation under the supervision of and with the participation of our management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” based on this evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded 1 that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2007 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and 2 that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of december 31 2007 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to our management including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures accordingly even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives 

 

remediation of previously disclosed material weaknesses 

 

as previously disclosed in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2006 we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the seven material weaknesses we reported as of december 31 2006 are summarized as follows 

 

 98 

 

  

we made improvements in our internal control over financial reporting throughout 2006 and 2007 and in the fourth quarter of 2007 management concluded that the improved controls had been operating for a sufficient period of time to allow the effectiveness of the remediation measures to be validated after reviewing the results of its testing in the fourth quarter of 2007 management concluded that controls related to the remediation of the material weaknesses previously disclosed in the 2006 annual report on form 10k were designed in place and operating effectively for a sufficient period of time for management to determine that each of the material weaknesses was remediated as of december 31 2007 the key changes in internal control and remedial actions taken related to these previously reported material weaknesses are discussed below

 item 1   business tableend  

the interpublic group of companies inc was incorporated in delaware in september 1930 under the name of mccannerickson incorporated as the successor to the advertising agency businesses founded in 1902 by aw erickson and in 1911 by harrison k mccann the company has operated under the interpublic name since january 1961 

 

about us 

 

the interpublic group of companies inc together with its subsidiaries the “company” “interpublic” “we” “us” or “our” is one of the world’s largest advertising and marketing services companies comprised of communication agencies around the world that deliver custom marketing solutions on behalf of our clients these agencies cover the spectrum of marketing disciplines and specialties from traditional services such as consumer advertising and direct marketing to emerging services such as mobile and search engine marketing with hundreds of offices in over 100 countries and approximately 42000 employees our agencies develop marketing programs that build brands influence consumer behavior and sell products 

 

to meet the challenge of an increasingly complex consumer culture we create customized marketing solutions for each of our clients these solutions vary from projectbased work between one agency and its client to longterm fullyintegrated campaigns involving several of our companies working on behalf of a client furthermore our agencies cover all major markets geographically and can operate in a single region or align work globally across many markets 

 

the role of the holding company is to provide resources and support to ensure that our agencies can best meet our clients’ needs based in new york city interpublic sets companywide financial objectives and corporate strategy directs collaborative interagency programs establishes financial management and operational controls guides personnel policy conducts investor relations and initiates manages and approves mergers and acquisitions in addition we provide limited centralized functional services that offer our companies operational efficiencies including accounting and finance marketing information retrieval and analysis legal services real estate expertise travel services recruitment aid employee benefits and executive compensation management 

 

our strategy 

 

we compete in a fastchanging industry to keep pace with the trends transforming the media landscape including new technologies a proliferation of media channels and changes in consumer habits we believe a marketing communications group must have a broad spectrum of innovative agency brands to help clients navigate a fragmented market 

 

to keep our company wellpositioned we support our agencies’ initiatives to expand their highgrowth capabilities and build their offerings in key developing markets when appropriate we also develop relationships with companies that are building leadingedge marketing tools that complement our agencies and the programs they are developing for clients in addition we look for opportunities within our company to modernize operations through mergers strategic alliances and the development of internal programs that encourage intracompany collaboration 

 

in 2006 we took a number of steps to lead our company forward strategically these initiatives include merging two of our companies to form draftfcb a modern integrated global agency a realignment of our media assets with our two largest global advertising networks to create a closer working relationship between the two disciplines a newly focused lowe with hubs in eight key markets and strategic digital investments both internally and externally 

 

to manage the broadest range of clients we continue to maintain separate agency brands in competing disciplines having distinct agencies allows us to create custom solutions best suited to specific clients as well as avoid potential conflicts of interest among clients in the same industry 

 

our brands 

 

within interpublic we have some of the world’s best known and most innovative communication specialists 

 

globally we offer three distinct options for clients seeking largescale integrated capabilities across all our disciplines these include draftfcb lowe worldwide and mccann worldgroup 

 

launched in 2006 draftfcb is a modern agency model for clients seeking creative and accountable marketing programs with more than 130 years of combined expertise the newly formed company has its roots in both consumer advertising and behavioral datadriven direct marketing the agency is the first global behaviorbased highly creative and accountable marketing communications organization to operate with a single income statement 

 

lowe worldwide is a premier creative agency that operates in the world’s largest advertising markets lowe is focused on delivering and sustaining highvalue ideas for some of the world’s largest clients the quality of the agency’s product is evident in its global creative rankings and its standing in major markets including the united kingdom united states india sweden and much of latin america by partnering with interpublic’s marketing services companies lowe generates and executes ideas that are frequently recognized for effectiveness amplified by smart communication channel planning 

 

mccann worldgroup one of the world’s leading marketing communications companies offers bestinclass communications tools and resources to many of the world’s top companies and most famous brands as more and more marketers seek additional ways to reach consumers mccann worldgroup is exceptionally qualified to meet their demands in all regions of the world and in all marketing disciplines through its operating units mccann erickson advertising with operations in over 100 countries mrm worldwide for relationship marketing and digital expertise momentum worldwide for experiential marketing and mccann healthcare worldwide for healthcare communications 

 

within our group we also have a unique roster of strong fullservice domestic agency brands including campbellewald campbell mithun deutsch hill holliday the martin agency and mullen the integrated marketing programs created by this group have helped build some of the most powerful brands in the us across all sectors and industries 

 

interpublic also has two leading media specialists initiative and universal mccann to develop creative ideas that resonate with consumers brandbuilding agencies must work closely with media agencies initiative and universal mccann operate independently but were aligned with draftfcb and mccann erickson respectively in late 2006 this approach is intended to improve crossmedia communications and our ability to deliver integrated marketing programs our “aligned model” with respect to media differentiates us from our principal competitors 

 

interpublic also has exceptional specialist firms across the full range of marketing services these include futurebrand corporate branding jack morton experiential marketing octagon sports marketing regan campbell ward healthcare communications and webershandwick public relations all of which report into our constituency management group “cmg” we also have bestinclass digital agencies led by rga to further strengthen our emergingmedia offering in late 2006 we formed the futures marketing group which houses existing highgrowth media offerings such as the interpublic emerging media lab and fosters new media investments and alliances many more of our marketing specialists can be found using the “company finder” tool on our website wwwinterpubliccom 

 

to help clients target fastgrowth demographic segments in the us market interpublic owns a stake in several multicultural agencies including abecé hispanic accent marketing hispanic the axis agency african american casanova pendrill hispanic iw group asianpacific american and siboneyusa hispanic 

 

our financial reporting segments 

 

for financial reporting purposes we have two reportable segments integrated agency network “ian” which is comprised of draftfcb lowe mccann our media agencies and our leading standalone agencies and cmg which is comprised of the bulk of our specialist marketing service offerings we also report results for the “corporate and other” group until december 31 2005 we had an additional segment motorsports operations “motorsports” which was sold during 2004 and had immaterial residual operating results in 2005 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

principal markets 

 

our agencies are located in over 100 countries including every significant world market we provide services for clients whose businesses are broadly international in scope as well as for clients whose businesses are limited to 

a single country or a small number of countries the united states “us” europe excluding the united kingdom “uk” the uk asia pacific and latin america represented 556 168 91 83 and 49 of our total revenue respectively in 2006 for further discussion concerning revenues and longlived assets on a geographical basis for each of the last three years see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

sources of revenue 

 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising programs in various media and the planning and execution of other marketing and communications programs most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the basis on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across various agencies in arranging for such services to be provided we may enter into global regional and local agreements 

 

revenues for creation planning and placement of advertising are determined primarily on a negotiated fee basis and to a lesser extent on a commission basis fees are usually calculated to reflect hourly rates plus proportional overhead and a markup many clients include an incentive compensation component in their total compensation package this provides added revenue based on achieving mutually agreedupon qualitative andor quantitative metrics within specified time periods commissions are earned based on services provided and are usually derived from a percentage or fee over the total cost to complete the assignment commissions can also be derived when clients pay us the gross rate billed by media and we pay for media at a lower net rate the difference is the commission that we earn which is either retained in total or shared with the client depending on the nature of the services agreement 

 

we pay the media charges with respect to contracts for advertising time or space that we place on behalf of our clients to reduce our risk from a client’s nonpayment we typically pay media charges only after we have received funds from our clients generally we act as the client’s agent rather than the primary obligor in some instances we agree with the media provider that we will only be liable to pay the media after the client has paid us for the media charges 

 

we also generate revenue in negotiated fees from our public relations sales promotion event marketing sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services 

 

our revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our clients and tends to be higher in the second half of the calendar year as a result of the holiday season and lower in the first half as a result of the postholiday slowdown in client activity depending on the terms of the client contract fees for services performed can be primarily recognized three ways proportional performance straightline or monthly basis or completed contract fee revenue recognized on a completed contract basis also contributes to the higher seasonal revenues experienced in the fourth quarter because the majority of our contracts end at december 31 as is customary in the industry our contracts generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 90 days see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting policies 

 

clients 

 

in the aggregate our top ten clients based on revenue accounted for approximately 25 of revenue in 2006 and 2005 based on revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 our largest clients were general motors corporation johnson  johnson microsoft unilever and verizon while the loss of the entire business of any one of our largest clients might have a material adverse effect upon our business we believe that it is unlikely that the entire business of any of these clients would be lost at the same time this is because we represent several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographic markets as well as provide services across multiple advertising and marketing disciplines in each case through more than one of our agency systems representation of a client rarely means that we handle advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from one of our agencies to a competing agency and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time 

 

personnel 

 

as of december 31 2006 we employed approximately 42000 persons of whom approximately 18000 were employed in the us because of the service character of the advertising and marketing communications business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to our continuing success there is keen competition for qualified employees

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

we are subject to a variety of possible risks that could adversely impact our revenues results of operations or financial condition some of these risks relate to the industry in which we operate while others are more specific to us the following factors set out potential risks we have identified that could adversely affect us see also statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure 

 

  

we have identified numerous material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2006 for a detailed description of these material weaknesses see item 8 management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting in this report each of our material weaknesses results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement will not be prevented or detected given the extensive material weaknesses identified there is a risk of errors not being prevented or detected which could require us to restate our financial statements in the future any such restatements could result in or contribute to regulatory actions or civil litigation ratings downgrades negative publicity or difficulties in attracting or retaining key clients employees and management personnel 

 

we incurred significant professional fees and other expenses in 2006 to prepare our consolidated financial statements and to comply with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 in particular as a result of the extent of the deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting and the extensive additional work and resources required to obtain reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial statements the cost of this work will continue to be significant in 2007 and beyond 

 

because of our decentralized structure and our many disparate accounting systems of varying quality and sophistication we have extensive work remaining to remediate our material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting we have developed a work plan with the goal of remediating all of the identified material weaknesses by the time we file our annual report on form 10k for the year ending december 31 2007 there can be no assurance however as to when the remediation plan will be fully implemented and all the material weaknesses remediated until our remediation is completed there will also continue to be a risk that we will be unable to file future periodic reports with the sec in a timely manner and that a default could result under the indentures governing our debt securities under any of our credit facilities or under any credit facilities of our subsidiaries 

 

  

the sec opened a formal investigation in response to the restatement we first announced in august 2002 and the investigation expanded to encompass the restatement we presented in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2004 that we filed in september 2005 the “2005 restatement” in particular since we filed our 2004 annual report on form 10k we have received subpoenas from the sec relating to matters addressed in our 2005 restatement we have also responded to inquiries from the sec staff concerning the restatement of the first three quarters of 2005 that we made in our 2005 annual report on form 10k we continue to cooperate with the investigation we expect that the investigation will result in monetary liability but because the investigation is ongoing in particular with respect to the 2005 restatement we cannot reasonably estimate the amount range of amounts or timing of a resolution accordingly we have not yet established any accounting provision relating to these matters adverse developments in connection with the investigation including any expansion of the scope of the investigation could also negatively impact us and could divert the efforts and attention of our management team from our ordinary business operations

the marketing communications business is highly competitive our agencies and media services must compete with other agencies and with other providers of creative or media services in order to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients the client’s perception of the quality of an agency’s creative work our reputation and the agencies’ reputations are important factors in determining our competitive position an agency’s ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis is also an important competitive consideration on the other hand because an agency’s principal asset is its people freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and a small agency is on occasion able to take all or some portion of a client’s account from a much larger competitor 

 

many companies put their advertising and marketing communications business up for competitive review from time to time we have won and lost client accounts in the past as a result of such periodic competitions our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may also in some cases be limited by clients’ policies or perceptions about conflicts of interest these policies can in some cases prevent one agency or even different agencies under our ownership from performing similar services for competing products or companies 

 

  

employees including creative research media account and practice group specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most important assets an important aspect of our competitiveness is our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel our ability to do so is influenced by a variety of factors including the compensation we award and could be adversely affected by our recent financial or market performance 

 

  

economic downturns often more severely affect the marketing services industry than other industries in the past some clients have responded to weak economic performance in any region where we operate by reducing their marketing budgets which are generally discretionary in nature and easier to reduce in the shortterm than other expenses related to operations this pattern may recur in the future 

 

  

our longterm debt is currently rated ba3 with negative outlook by moody’s b creditwatch negative by standard and poor’s and b with negative outlook by fitch it is possible that our credit ratings will be reduced further ratings downgrades or comparatively weak ratings can adversely affect us because ratings are an important factor influencing our ability to access capital our clients and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us it could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity 

 

  

in previous years we have experienced operating losses and weak operating cash flow until our margins consistently improve in connection with our turnaround cash generation from operations could be challenged in certain periods this could have a negative impact on our liquidity in future years and could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our working capital needs there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access any new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we were unable to do so our liquidity position could be adversely affected 

 

  

we have a large and diverse client base and at any given time one or more of our clients may experience financial distress file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business if any client with whom we have a substantial amount of business experiences financial difficulty it could delay or jeopardize the collection of accounts receivable may result in significant reductions in services provided by us and may have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and liquidity for a description of our client base see item 1 business — clients

international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues approximately 44 in 2006 our international operations are exposed to risks that affect foreign operations of all kinds including local legislation monetary devaluation exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions these risks may limit our ability to grow our business and effectively manage our operations in those countries in addition because a significant portion of our business is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar such as the euro pound sterling canadian dollar brazilian real japanese yen and south african rand fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such currencies may materially affect our financial results 

 

  

we evaluate all of our longlived assets including goodwill other intangible assets and fixed assets investments and deferred tax assets for possible impairment or realizability at least annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment or lack of realizability if certain criteria are met we are required to record an impairment charge or valuation allowance in the past we have recorded substantial amounts of goodwill investment and other impairment charges and have been required to establish substantial valuation allowances with respect to deferred tax assets and loss carryforwards 

 

as of december 31 2006 we have substantial amounts of longlived assets investments and deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet future events including our financial performance and strategic decisions could cause us to conclude that further impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with longlived assets investments and deferred tax assets may have become impaired any resulting impairment loss would have an adverse impact on our reported earnings in the period in which the charge is recognized 

 

  

from time to time we communicate to the market certain targets and milestones for our financial and operating performance including but not limited to the areas of revenue growth operating expense reduction and operating margin growth these targets and milestones are intended to provide metrics against which to evaluate our performance but they should not be understood as predictions or guidance about our expected performance our ability to meet any target or milestone is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and we caution investors against placing undue reliance on them see “statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure” 

 

  

our industry is subject to government regulation and other governmental action both domestic and foreign there has been an increasing tendency on the part of advertisers and consumer groups to challenge advertising through legislation regulation the courts or otherwise for example on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive or injurious to public welfare through the years there has been a continuing expansion of specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products representatives within government bodies both domestic and foreign continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently our revenues

executive summary 

 

we are one of the world’s largest advertising and marketing services companies comprised of communication agencies around the world that deliver custom marketing solutions on behalf of our clients these agencies cover the spectrum of marketing disciplines and specialties from traditional services such as consumer advertising and direct marketing to emerging services such as mobile and search engine marketing to meet the challenge of an increasingly complex consumer culture we create customized marketing solutions for each of our clients these solutions vary from projectbased work between one agency and its client to longterm fullyintegrated campaigns involving several of our companies working on behalf of a client furthermore our agencies cover all major markets geographically and can operate in a single region or align work globally across many markets 

 

our strategy is focused on improving organic revenue growth and our operating income and we are working to achieve a level of organic revenue growth comparable to industry peers and doubledigit operating margins by 2008 we analyze periodtoperiod changes in our operating performance by determining the portion of the change that is attributable to foreign currency rates and the change attributable to the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures and the remainder is considered the organic change for purposes of analyzing this change acquisitions and divestitures are treated as if they occurred on the first day of the quarter during which the transaction occurred 

 

revenue is directly dependent upon the advertising marketing and corporate communications requirements of our clients for 2006 our revenues were negatively affected primarily by the client losses and dispositions that occurred in 2005 and we expect our operating margin will continue to be negatively affected as compared to our peers by high expenses for professional fees although to a decreasing extent it is typical in our industry to lose or resign from client accounts and assignments for many reasons including conflicts with recent client wins we 

 

the interpublic group of companies inc and subsidiaries management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

believe we are continuing our turnaround and our results for 2006 reflect the challenges we face improving revenues and operating margins however we have achieved some notable success in new client wins as well as fewer client losses in 2006 which supports our efforts in our turnaround 

 

our reported results are affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies of our international businesses principally the brazilian real canadian dollar japanese yen pound sterling south african rand and euro in 2006 the us dollar was weaker against most of these currencies compared to 2005 in 2005 the us dollar was weaker against most of these currencies compared to 2004 as a result the net effect of foreign currency changes from comparable prior year periods was to increase revenues and operating expenses in 2006 and 2005 

 

as discussed in more detail in this mda for 2006 compared to 2005 

 

  

critical accounting estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the accompanying notes we believe that of our significant accounting policies the following critical accounting estimates involve management’s most difficult subjective or complex judgments we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the underlying assumptions or estimates have the potential to materially impact our financial statements management has discussed with our audit committee the development selection application and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates we regularly evaluate our judgments assumptions and estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be relevant under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

 

revenue recognition 

 

our revenues are primarily derived from the planning and execution of advertising programs in various media and the planning and execution of other marketing and communications programs most of our client contracts are individually negotiated and accordingly the terms of client engagements and the basis on which we earn commissions and fees vary significantly our client contracts are complex arrangements that may include provisions for incentive compensation and govern vendor rebates and credits our largest clients are multinational entities and as such we often provide services to these clients out of multiple offices and across 

 

the interpublic group of companies inc and subsidiaries management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

various agencies in arranging for such services to be provided it is possible for a global regional and local agreement to be initiated multiple agreements of this nature are reviewed by legal counsel to determine the governing terms to be followed by the offices and agencies involved critical judgments and estimates are involved in determining both the amount and timing of revenue recognition under these arrangements 

 

revenue for our services is recognized when all of the following criteria are satisfied i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii the price is fixed or determinable iii collectibility is reasonably assured and iv services have been performed depending on the terms of a client contract fees for services performed can be primarily recognized in one of three ways proportional performance straightline or monthly basis or completed contract see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

depending on the terms of the client contract revenue is derived from diverse arrangements involving fees for services performed commissions performance incentive provisions and combinations of the three commissions are generally earned on the date of the broadcast or publication contractual arrangements with clients may also include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of the revenue to our performance relative to both qualitative and quantitative goals performance incentives are recognized as revenue for quantitative targets when the target has been achieved and for qualitative targets when confirmation of the incentive is received from the client the classification of client arrangements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition involves judgments if the judgments change there can be a material impact on our financial statements and particularly on the allocation of revenues between periods incremental direct costs incurred related to contracts where revenue is accounted for on a completed contract basis are generally expensed as incurred there are certain exceptions made for significant contracts or for certain agencies where the majority of the contracts are projectbased and systems are in place to properly capture appropriate direct costs 

 

substantially all of our revenue is recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less passthrough expenses charged to a client in most cases the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our financial statements because of various passthrough expenses such as production and media costs in compliance with emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 9919 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  we assess whether our agency or the thirdparty supplier is the primary obligor we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment in addition we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor because we operate broadly as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a net versus gross basis we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting accordingly we generally record revenue net of passthrough charges as we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business in those businesses primarily sales promotion event sports and entertainment marketing and corporate and brand identity services where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue and the related costs incurred as operating expenses revenue is reported net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on our revenue producing transactions 

 

the determination as to whether revenue in a particular line of business should be recognized net or gross involves difficult judgments if we make these judgments differently it could significantly affect our financial performance if it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a gross basis rather than a net basis it would positively impact revenues but have no impact on our operating income and an adverse impact on operating margin conversely if it were determined that we must recognize a significant portion of revenues on a net basis rather than a gross basis it would negatively impact revenues but have no impact on our operating income and a positive impact on operation margin 

 

we receive credits from our vendors and media outlets for transactions entered into on behalf of our clients that based on the terms of our contracts and local law are either remitted to our clients or retained by us if amounts are to be passed through to clients they are recorded as liabilities until settlement or if retained by us are recorded as revenue when earned 

 

the interpublic group of companies inc and subsidiaries management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

negotiations with a client at the close of a current engagement could result in either payments to the client in excess of the contractual liability or in payments less than the contractual liability these items referred to as concessions relate directly to the operations of the period and are recorded as operating expense or income 

 

concession income or expense may also be realized in connection with settling vendor discount or credit liabilities that were established as part of the 2005 restatement in these situations and given the historical nature of these liabilities we have recorded such items as other income or expense in order to prevent distortion of current operating results see also notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

stockbased compensation 

 

on january 1 2006 we adopted sfas no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment “sfas no 123r” sfas no 123r requires compensation costs related to sharebased transactions including employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value we implemented sfas no 123r using the modified prospective transition method under this transition method the compensation expense recognized beginning january 1 2006 includes compensation expense for i all stockbased payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of january 1 2006 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 and ii all stockbased awards granted subsequent to december 31 2005 based on the grantdate fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123r compensation cost is generally recognized ratably over the requisite service period net of estimated forfeitures 

 

we use the blackscholes optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted which requires the input of subjective assumptions including the option’s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value and our results of operations could be materially impacted the expected volatility factor is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of our tradable forward put and call options to purchase and sell shares of our common stock the expected term is based on the average of an assumption that outstanding options are exercised upon achieving their full vesting date and will be exercised at the midpoint between the current date ie the date awards have been ratably vested through and their full contractual term additionally we calculate an estimated forfeiture rate which impacts our recorded expense see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

income taxes 

 

the provision for income taxes includes federal state local and foreign taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed changes to enacted tax rates would result in either increases or decreases in the provision for income taxes in the period of changes we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 

 

the realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future earnings any reduction in estimated forecasted results may require that we record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets once a valuation allowance has been established it will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized a pattern of sustained profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence to reverse a valuation allowance if the allowance is reversed in a future period our income tax provision will be correspondingly reduced accordingly the increase and decrease of valuation allowances has had and could have a significant negative or positive impact on our future earnings see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information

goodwill and other intangible assets 

 

we account for our business combinations using the purchase accounting method the total costs of the acquisitions are allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair market values and the remainder allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets considering the characteristics of advertising specialized marketing and communication services companies our acquisitions usually do not have significant amounts of tangible assets as the principal asset we typically acquire is creative talent as a result a substantial portion of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill determining the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and involves the use of significant estimates including future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples 

 

we review goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization during the fourth quarter or whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at a reporting unit level we identified 14 reporting units for the 2006 annual impairment testing that are either the entities at the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level we review intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization are amortized on a straightline basis with estimated useful lives of up to 15 years events or circumstances that might require impairment testing include the loss of a significant client the identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit loss of key personnel the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 

 

sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  specifies a twostep process for goodwill impairment testing and measuring the magnitude of any impairment the first step of the impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill goodwill allocated to a reporting unit whose fair value is equal to or greater than its carrying value is not impaired and no further testing is required should the carrying amount for a reporting unit exceed its fair value then the first step of the impairment test is failed and the magnitude of any goodwill impairment is determined under the second step the second step is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired when its carrying value exceeds its implied fair value impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value with a charge to expense in the period the impairment is identified 

 

the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using traditional valuation techniques such as the income approach which incorporates the use of the discounted cash flow method and the market approach which incorporates the use of earning and revenue multiples these techniques use projections which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions as to matters such as future revenue growth profit margins capital expenditures assumed tax rates and discount rates we believe that the estimates and assumptions made are reasonable but they are susceptible to change from period to period for example our strategic decisions or changes in market valuation multiples could lead to impairment charges actual results of operations cash flows and other factors used in a discounted cash flow valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material 

 

our annual impairment reviews as of october 1st 2006 resulted in an impairment charge of 272 at one of our domestic advertising reporting units see note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information the excess of the fair value over the carrying value at the low end of the valuation range for each of the nonimpaired reporting units ranged from 02 to 19902 and 24 to 15019 in 2006 and 2005 respectively for 2006 this excess ranged from 24 to 24002 at the high end of the valuation range in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit for 2006 this would result in the total carrying value being less than the total fair value at the low end of the range by 468 which would have triggered additional step two tests for 2005 this hypothetical 10 decrease would result in the total carrying value being less than the total fair value at the low end of the range by 382 which would have triggered additional step two tests

pension and postretirement benefits 

 

we use various actuarial assumptions in determining our net pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations these assumptions include discount rates and expected returns on plan assets and are updated annually or more frequently with the occurrence of significant events changes in the related pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions 

 

the discount rate is one of the significant assumptions that impacts our net pension and postretirement costs and obligations the discount rates are determined at the beginning of the year based on prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date and are adjusted to match the duration of the underlying obligation for 2007 we plan to use weighted average discount rates of 568 482 and 575 for the domestic pension plans foreign plans and the postretirement plan respectively changes in the discount rates are generally due to increases or decreases in longterm interest rates a higher discount rate will decrease our pension cost a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the 2006 net pension and postretirement cost by 23 and 01 respectively in addition a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have decreased or increased the december 31 2006 benefit obligation by 314 

 

the expected rate of return on pension plan assets is another significant assumption that impacts our net pension cost and is determined at the beginning of the year changes in the rates are due to lower or higher expected future returns based on the mix of assets held and studies performed by our external investment advisors for 2007 we plan to use weighted average expected rates of return of 816 and 757 for the domestic and foreign pension plans respectively a lower expected rate of return will increase our net pension cost a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have decreased or increased the 2006 net pension cost by 11 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

results of operations 

 

consolidated results of operations 

 

revenue 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

 

 

revenue decreased due to net divestitures partially offset by organic revenue increases and changes in foreign currency exchange rates net divestitures primarily impacted the integrated agency networks “ian” segment largely from draftfcb and mccann during 2005 there were net organic revenue increases in both our international and domestic locations the international organic increase was driven by higher revenue from existing clients primarily in the asia pacific and latin america regions partially offset by net client losses primarily in 2005 at ian as well as decreases in the events marketing businesses at the constituency management group “cmg” in the united kingdom region the domestic organic increase was primarily driven by growth in the public relations and branding businesses at cmg as well as higher revenue from existing clients partially offset by net client losses and decreased client spending at ian

2005 compared to 2004 

 

 

 

revenue decreased during 2005 due to net divestitures and organic revenue decreases partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates the revenue decline from net divestitures was largely due to dispositions at mccann during 2005 primarily in the europe and united states regions and the sale of the motorsports business during 2004 the organic revenue decrease was driven by ian partially offset by an increase at cmg the decrease at ian was a result of client losses and a reduction in revenue from existing clients primarily in our european offices the increase at cmg was primarily driven by growth in public relations businesses internationally and the sports marketing businesses domestically as a result of increased spending from existing clients and client wins 

 

operating expenses 

 

 

 

salaries and related expenses 

 

salaries and related expenses are the largest component of operating expenses and consist of payroll costs employee performance incentives including short and longterm incentive awards and other benefits associated with client service professional staff and administrative staff salaries and related expenses do not vary significantly with shortterm changes in revenue levels however salaries may fluctuate due to the timing of hiring freelance contractors who are utilized to support business development changes in the funding levels of short and longterm incentive awards and changes in foreign currency exchange rates our financial performance over the past few years has lagged behind our peers primarily due to lower revenue growth as a result salaries and related expenses reflect significant severance charges primarily incurred in previous years and investments in hiring creative talent to realign the business for revenue growth and improved operating margins also salaries and related expenses reflect the hiring of additional finance professionals and information technology staff to upgrade system infrastructure and to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment as well as to develop shared services 

 

 

 

the interpublic group of companies inc and subsidiaries management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

salaries and related expenses decreased during 2006 due to net divestitures primarily from the sale of several businesses at ian during 2005 partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a slight organic increase total salaries and related expenses as a percentage of revenue remained flat as a result of the decline in revenue key factors behind the change in salaries and related expenses from the prior year were a significant reduction in severance expense of 637 offset by an increase in longterm incentive awards and bonus awards of 672 expenses related to incentive awards increased in 2006 due to longterm equity based awards granted in june 2006 and the full year impact of awards granted in august 2005 while expenses related to bonus awards increased primarily due to performance the slight organic increase reflected in cmg and corporate was offset by a decrease at ian and was primarily the result of higher salary costs to upgrade our talent and to support revenue initiatives and technologyrelated projects increased incentive awards and bonus awards this was partially offset by a decrease in severance expense primarily at international locations within ian which we incurred in 2005 due to client losses 

 

2005 compared to 2004 

 

salaries and related expenses increased primarily due to an organic increase and changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by net divestitures primarily at mccann during 2005 and the sale of the motorsports business during 2004 the organic increase was primarily the result of higher severance expense largely recorded in the fourth quarter of 2005 for international headcount reductions within ian as a result of client losses the hiring of additional creative talent to enable future revenue growth additional staff to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment and to develop shared services at certain locations 

 

office and general expenses 

 

office and general expenses include rent expense professional fees expenses attributable to the support of client service professional staff depreciation and amortization costs bad debt expense relating to accounts receivable the costs associated with the development of a shared services center and implementation costs associated with upgrading our information technology infrastructure office and general expenses also include costs directly attributable to client engagements these costs include outofpocket costs such as travel for client service professional staff production costs and other direct costs that are rebilled to our clients 

 

 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

office and general expenses for 2006 declined as a result of significant reductions in professional fees which decreased by 937 primarily for projects related to our restatement activities and internal control compliance that occurred in 2005 lower production expenses lower bad debt expenses and net divestitures primarily due to the sale of several businesses at ian during 2005 the decline in office and general expenses occurred in both segments as well as corporate partially offsetting this decrease were higher rent expense and reduced foreign exchange gains on certain balance sheet items the above items resulted in an organic decline which was primarily reflected at corporate and ian 

 

2005 compared to 2004 

 

office and general expenses for 2005 increased as a result of an organic increase and changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset by net divestitures primarily at mccann during 2005 and the sale of the motorsports business during 2004 the organic increase was primarily the result of higher professional fees

primarily at ian and our corporate group driven by our ongoing efforts in internal control compliance the 2005 restatement process and the preliminary development application and maintenance of information technology systems and processes related to our shared services initiatives 

 

restructuring and other reorganizationrelated charges reversals 

 

the components of restructuring and other reorganizationrelated charges reversals were as follows 

 

 

 

other reorganizationrelated charges 

 

other reorganizationrelated charges primarily represent severance charges directly associated with two significant strategic business decisions the merger of draft worldwide and foote cone and belding worldwide to create a global integrated marketing organization called draftfcb and our realignment of our media business to meet evolving client needs in addition we have recorded lease termination charges in relation to the exit of certain properties for these strategic business decisions these charges were separated from salaries and related expenses and office and general expenses as they did not result from charges that occurred in the normal course of business we expect charges relating to these business decisions to be complete during the first half of 2007 

 

restructuring charges reversals 

 

we record charges and reversals primarily related to changes in assumptions in connection with lease termination and other exit costs and severance and termination costs for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring programs the 2003 program was initiated in response to softness in demand for advertising and marketing services the 2001 program was initiated following the acquisition of true north communications inc and was designed to integrate the acquisition and improve productivity a summary of the net charges and reversals for the 2003 and 2001 restructuring program is as follows 

 

 

 

during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 net lease termination and other exit costs were primarily related to adjustments to management’s estimates to decrease the restructuring reserves as a result of changes in sublease rental income assumptions and utilization of previously vacated properties relating to the 2003 program by certain of our agencies due to improved economic conditions in certain markets 

 

during the year ended december 31 2004 net lease termination and other exit costs were recorded primarily for the 2003 restructuring program for the vacating of 43 offices located primarily in the us and europe charges were recorded at net present value and were net of estimated sublease rental income these charges were partially offset primarily by management’s adjustments to estimates as a result of our negotiation of terms upon the exit of leased properties and for other reasons similar to those mentioned above for 2006 and 2005 severance and termination costs were recorded for a worldwide workforce reduction of approximately 400 employees the restructuring program affected employee groups across all levels and functions including executive regional and account management and administrative creative and media production personnel these charges were partially 

 

the interpublic group of companies inc and subsidiaries management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

offset by adjustments to management’s estimates to reduce the prior restructuring reserves primarily as a result of decreases in the number of terminated employees change in amounts paid to terminated employees and change in estimates of related restricted stock payments and payroll taxes 

 

longlived asset impairment and other charges 

 

longlived assets include land buildings equipment goodwill and other intangible assets buildings equipment and other intangible assets with finite lives are generally depreciated or amortized on a straightline basis over their respective estimated useful lives when necessary we record an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the implied fair value see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for fair value determination and impairment testing methodologies 

 

the following table summarizes longlived asset impairment and other charges 

 

 

 

 

ian  — our longterm projections which were updated in the fourth quarter of 2006 showed previously unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows due primarily to recent client losses at one of our domestic advertising reporting units these discounted future operating cash flow projections indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill at this reporting unit was less than its book value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of 272 

 

 

ian  — a triggering event occurred subsequent to our 2005 annual impairment test when a major client was lost by lowe’s london agency and the possibility of losing other clients was considered a higher risk due to recent management defections and changes in the competitive landscape this caused projected revenue growth to decline as a result of these changes our longterm projections showed declines in discounted future operating cash flows these revised cash flows indicated that the implied fair value of lowe’s goodwill was less than the related book value resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of 910 at our lowe reporting unit 

 

ian  — during the third quarter of 2005 we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 58 at a reporting unit within our sports and entertainment marketing business the longterm projections showed previously unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows and as a result these discounted future operating cash flows indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the related book value 

 

 

ian  — during the third quarter of 2004 we recorded goodwill impairment charges of 2202 at the partnership reporting unit which was comprised of lowe worldwide draft worldwide mullen dailey  associates and berenter greenhouse  webster “bgw” our longterm projections showed previously unanticipated declines in discounted future operating cash flows due to recent client losses reduced client spending and declining industry valuation metrics these discounted future operating cash flow projections indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the related book value the partnership was subsequently disbanded in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the remaining goodwill was allocated to the agencies within the partnership based on the relative fair value of its component agencies at the time of disbandment 

 

the interpublic group of companies inc and subsidiaries management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

cmg  — as a result of the annual impairment review a goodwill impairment charge of 917 was recorded at our cmg reporting unit which was comprised of weber shandwick golinharris devries mww group and futurebrand the fair value of cmg was adversely affected by declining industry market valuation metrics specifically a decrease in the ebitda multiples used in the underlying valuation calculations the impact of the lower ebitda multiples indicated that the implied fair value of goodwill was less than the related book value 

 

motorsports contract termination costs 

 

we recorded a pretax charge of 1136 during 2004 terminating a series of agreements with the british racing drivers club and formula one administration limited which released us from certain guarantees and lease obligations in the united kingdom 

 

expense and other income 

 

 

 

interest expense 

 

the increase in interest expense during 2006 was primarily due to increases in noncash amortization of approximately 270 this included the amortization of fees and deferred warrant costs incurred as a result of the elf financing transaction prior year benefit from the amortization of gains on terminated swaps and the amortization of the remaining costs associated with our previous committed credit agreement additionally the increase was due to onetime fees associated with the exchange of our floating rate notes in 2006 the 2006 yearoveryear comparison benefited from the fact that we did not incur waiver and consent fees similar to those incurred in 2005 for the amendment of the indentures governing our debt securities and our credit facility 

 

the increase in interest expense during 2005 was primarily due to waiver and consent fees incurred for the amendment of our existing debt agreements in 2005 and higher average interest rates on newly issued debt when compared to extinguished debt 

 

interest income 

 

the increase in interest income during 2006 was primarily due to an increase in interest rates and higher average cash balances compared to the prior year 

 

the increase in interest income during 2005 was primarily due to an increase in average interest rates as well an increase in cash and cash equivalents primarily resulting from our series b cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock offering 

 

the interpublic group of companies inc and subsidiaries management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

other income expense 

 

 

 

loss on early extinguishment of debt  — in november 2006 we exchanged 4000 of our 450 convertible senior notes due 2023 the “450 notes” for 4000 aggregate principal amount of 425 convertible senior notes due 2023 the “425 notes” in accordance with emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 9619 debtor’s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments  this exchange is treated as an extinguishment of the 450 notes and an issuance of 425 notes for accounting purposes because the present value of the remaining cash flows plus the fair value of the embedded conversion option under the terms of the original instrument differ substantially from the new instrument as a result we recorded a noncash charge at issuance of 770 reflecting the difference between the fair value of the new debt and the carrying value of the old debt the difference between fair value and carrying value will be amortized to interest expense through march 15 2012 which is the first date holders may require us to repurchase the 425 notes this results in a reduction of reported interest expense of 144 per year in future annual periods we also recorded a noncash charge of 38 for the extinguishment of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the exchanged 450 notes 

 

gains losses on sales of businesses  — in connection with the 2005 sale of a european fcb agency we released 111 into income in the fourth quarter of 2006 this primarily related to certain contingent liabilities that we retained subsequent to the sale which were resolved in the fourth quarter of 2006 during the fourth quarter of 2005 we had net gains related to the sale of a mccann agency of 186 offset partially by a loss of 130 from the sale of a european fcb agency in 2004 we had net losses related to the sale of 19 agencies the losses related primarily to the sale of a usbased promotions agency which resulted in a loss of 86 and a 62 loss for the final liquidation of the motorsports investment 

 

we have evaluated each asset held for sale and disposed entity on an individual and an aggregate basis to determine if they should be classified as a component of discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements we believe that the impact of these dispositions and assets held for sale are not material to our consolidated financial statements these dispositions and assets held for sale in the aggregate provided income to continuing operations of 25 for the year ended december 31 2006 

 

vendor discount and credit adjustments  — these adjustments reflect the reversal of certain liabilities primarily established during the 2005 restatement where the statute of limitations has lapsed or where negotiations with clients have resulted in concessions we may have similar reversals in the future although to a lesser extent than in 2006 we believe that presenting amounts realized due to lapses in the statute of limitations or concession settlements as other income or expense prevents the trend of operating results from being distorted for further information on vendor discounts and credits see notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

gains on sales of availableforsale securities and miscellaneous investment income  — in the second quarter of 2006 we had net gains of 209 related to the sale of an investment located in asia pacific and the sale of our remaining ownership interest in an agency within the lowe group in addition during the third quarter of 2006 we sold our interest in a german advertising agency and recognized the related remaining cumulative translation adjustment balance which resulted in a noncash benefit of 170 in 2005 we had net gains of 83 related to the 

 

the interpublic group of companies inc and subsidiaries management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

sale of our remaining equity ownership interest in an agency within fcb and net gains on sales of availableforsale securities of 79 of which 38 related to appreciation of rabbi trust investments restricted for the purpose of paying our deferred compensation and deferred benefit arrangement liabilities 

 

investment impairments  — we recorded charges of 122 during 2005 primarily related to a 71 adjustment of the carrying amount of our remaining unconsolidated investment in latin america to fair value as a result of our intent to sell and 37 related to a decline in value of certain availableforsale investments that were determined to be other than temporary 

 

we recorded investment impairment charges of 634 during 2004 primarily related to a 509 charge for an unconsolidated investment in a german advertising agency as a result of a decrease in projected operating results additionally we recorded impairment charges of 47 related to unconsolidated affiliates primarily in israel brazil japan and india and 78 related to several other availableforsale investments 

 

litigation reversals  — during 2004 the settlement of thirteen class actions under the federal securities laws became final and we agreed to pay 1150 comprised of 200 in cash and 950 in shares of our common stock valued at 1450 per share we received insurance proceeds of 200 which we recorded as a reduction in litigation charges we also recorded a reduction of 125 relating to a decrease in the share price between the tentative settlement date and the final settlement date 

 

income taxes 

 

 

 

the tax provision for 2006 was primarily impacted by domestic losses foreign profits subject to tax at different rates and losses in certain foreign locations where we receive no tax benefit due to 100 valuation allowances other factors included state and local taxes the writeoff of deferred tax assets from restricted stock the release of valuation allowances nondeductible financing costs and the reversal of previously claimed foreign tax credits 

 

the tax provision for 2005 was primarily impacted by an increase in valuation allowances a nondeductible asset impairment state and local taxes and the resolution of various income tax audits and issues 

 

valuation allowance 

 

under statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 109 accounting for income taxes  we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets sfas no 109 requires that a valuation allowance be recognized when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized in circumstances where there is significant negative evidence establishment of valuation allowance must be considered we believe that cumulative losses in the most recent threeyear period represent significant negative evidence under the provisions of sfas no 109 and as a result we recognized a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets the deferred tax assets for which an allowance was recognized relate primarily to tax credit carryforwards foreign tax loss and us capital loss carryforwards which may not be realized in the future 

 

during 2006 and 2005 valuation allowances of 636 and 699 respectively were recorded in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets each year’s loss and temporary differences the total valuation allowance as of december 31 2006 and 2005 was 5040 and 5010 respectively 

 

the interpublic group of companies inc and subsidiaries management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

during 2004 a valuation allowance of 2360 was established in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets and 2004 losses with no benefit the total valuation allowance as of december 31 2004 was 4886

segment results of operations 

 

as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements we have two reportable segments as of december 31 2006 ian and cmg we also report results for the corporate and other group as of december 31 2005 we had an additional segment motorsports operations “motorsports” which was sold during 2004 and had immaterial residual operating results in 2005 

 

on june 1 2006 we announced we would merge two units included in our ian segment draft worldwide “draft” and foote cone  belding worldwide “fcb” to create a global integrated marketing organization the new merged entity draftfcb remains within the ian segment

the revenue decline in 2006 was a result of net divestitures primarily from the sale of several businesses at draftfcb and mccann in 2005 partially offset by an organic increase and changes in foreign currency exchange rates the organic increase was driven primarily by mccann and draftfcb partially offset by decreases at lowe and the works one of our independent agencies the organic increase at mccann was the result of higher revenue from existing clients across domestic and international regions primarily asia pacific and latin america mccann’s increase was primarily driven by digital direct and event marketing services the increase at draftfcb was primarily the result of increased spending from existing clients partially offset by net client losses primarily in 2005 across domestic and most international regions primarily europe asia pacific and latin america the decrease at lowe was primarily due to reduced spending by existing clients and net client losses primarily in domestic locations in 2005 the revenue decrease at the works a dedicated general motors resource was primarily due to the loss of the general motors us media buying business in 2005 

 

2005 compared to 2004 

 

 

 

the revenue decline in 2005 primarily resulted from organic revenue decreases and net divestitures partially offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates the organic revenue decrease was primarily driven by declines at deutsch and lowe partially offset by increases at draftfcb and mullen the decline at deutsch was due to client losses and reduced spending from existing clients domestically partially offset by client wins the decline

at lowe was primarily driven by client losses and reduced spending from existing clients in their european offices as well as reduced spending domestically draftfcb experienced growth mainly domestically due to client wins and increased spending from existing clients although mccann is a significant part of the business they did not contribute considerably to the organic change in revenue year over year the decrease due to net divestitures primarily related to the sale of small businesses at mccann and draftfcb 

 

segment operating income 

 

 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

operating income increased during 2006 due to a decrease in office and general expenses of 1397 a decrease in salaries and related expenses of 992 partially offset by a decrease in revenue of 972 the primary drivers for our reduced office and general expenses related to lower production expenses of 464 reduced professional fees of 263 and lower bad debt expense of 222 the primary drivers for our reduced salaries and related expenses related to lower severance expense of 631 and decreased salaries of 420 

 

the organic segment operating income increase was driven primarily by increases at mccann partially offset by net decreases at our independent agencies the increase at mccann was due to higher revenue as discussed above in the revenue section and reduced office and general expenses and salaries and related expenses office and general expenses decreased due to lower production expenses reduced professional fees in connection with accounting projects such as those related to our restatement activities and lower bad debt expenses salaries and related expenses decreased primarily due to reduced severance expense for headcount reductions that occurred in international locations in 2005 and reduced pension costs partially offset by higher incentive and bonus awards due to improved performance the net decline at our independent agencies was driven by decreased revenue primarily at the works for the reasons mentioned above in the revenue section 

 

2005 compared to 2004 

 

a decrease in revenues of 714 an increase in salaries and related expenses of 2023 and an increase in office and general expenses of 537 were the primary drivers that contributed to the decrease in operating income during 2005 ian’s organic operating income decrease was primarily driven by mccann draftfcb lowe and deutsch the decrease at mccann was primarily caused by increased severance temporary staffing costs salary and related benefits and professional fees higher severance expense was the result of international headcount reductions temporary staffing and salary and related benefits were impacted by additional staffing necessary to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment professional fees increased as a result of costs associated with the 2005 restatement process and internal control compliance the decrease at draftfcb was due to higher salaries and freelance costs as additional staff were hired to service new clients and additional business from existing clients as well as increased severance costs reflecting headcount reductions at our international agencies at lowe the decrease was primarily due to organic revenue decreases as compared to the prior year deutsch experienced organic revenue decreases as compared to the prior year partially offset by lower salaries related benefits and freelance costs due to client losses and reduced incentive compensation expense as a result of a reduction in operating performance also operating income of most units was negatively impacted by higher professional fees to support the 2005 restatement process and internal control compliance

revenue 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

 

 

revenue growth was a result of organic revenue increases in the public relations and branding businesses domestically which was due to higher revenue from existing clients additionally there were organic revenue increases domestically in the sports marketing and events marketing businesses due to higher revenue from existing clients and client wins the domestic increase was partially offset by declines at some cmg agencies that lost clients internationally the decline related primarily to a decrease in the events marketing and sports marketing businesses caused by client losses the international decrease was partially offset by increases in the public relations and branding businesses due to higher revenue from existing clients 

 

2005 compared to 2004 

 

 

 

revenue growth was a result of an organic revenue increase in the public relations businesses internationally and the sports marketing businesses domestically as a result of increased spending from existing clients and client wins domestically the increase in the sports marketing businesses was offset by a decline in the events marketing businesses although revenue from the events marketing businesses declined domestically they had an overall positive impact on our organic revenue increase due to international client wins partially offsetting this increase were the dispositions of two businesses in 2005 and three businesses in 2004 

 

segment operating income 

 

 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

operating income decreased slightly primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and related expenses of 320 partially offset by a decrease in office and general expenses of 146 and an increase in revenue of 160 the primary driver for our increase in salaries and related expenses was higher base salaries expense of 223 and the primary driver for our decrease in office and general expenses was lower production expenses of 198 the slight organic segment operating income decrease was due to decreases in the sports marketing businesses and other cmg agencies offset by growth at the public relations and branding businesses the decline in the sports marketing

businesses was due to revenue decreases due to client losses and increases in salaries and related expenses due to higher bonus awards related to improved domestic performance the decrease in other cmg agencies was due to decreased revenue for the reasons described in the revenue section growth at the public relations businesses was driven by increased revenue partially offset by higher salaries and related expenses from increased headcount to support the growth in the business the increase at the branding businesses was driven primarily by higher revenue from existing clients 

 

2005 compared to 2004 

 

operating income decreased due to an increase of 233 in salary and related expenses and an increase in office and general expenses of 158 partially offset by an increase in revenue of 84 the organic operating income decrease was primarily driven by increases in salary expense across all businesses due to increased headcount to address weaknesses in our accounting and control environment the decrease was also attributable to increases in salary expenses in the public relations businesses to support revenue growth 

 

corporate and other 

 

certain corporate and other charges are reported as a separate line within total segment operating income loss and include corporate office expenses and shared services center expenses as well as certain other centrally managed expenses that are not fully allocated to operating divisions as shown in the table below the amounts allocated to operating divisions are calculated monthly based on a formula that uses the revenues of the operating unit amounts allocated also include specific charges for information technologyrelated projects which are allocated based on utilization see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of corporate and other charges the following expenses are included in corporate and other 

 

 

 

2006 compared to 2005 

 

corporate and other expenses decreased primarily due to reduced professional fees and higher amounts allocated to operating divisions partially offset by higher rent depreciation and amortization and increased salaries and related expenses we incurred lower professional fees for accounting projects which included those related to our prioryear restatement activities higher rent depreciation and amortization were due to softwarerelated costs from our ongoing initiatives to consolidate and upgrade our financial systems as well as to further develop our shared services salaries and related expenses increased due to higher headcount primarily related to our technology initiatives and for larger incentive compensation and bonus awards related to performance amounts allocated to operating divisions increased primarily due to the implementation of new information technologyrelated projects the consolidation of information technology support staff and the allocation of audit fees which are now being allocated back to operating divisions 

 

2005 compared to 2004 

 

corporate and other expenses increased primarily due to higher salaries and related expenses and professional fees salary expenses increased from additional staffing to address weaknesses in our accounting and control

environment and to develop shared services professional fees increased due to costs associated with internal control compliance costs associated with the 2005 restatement process and related audit costs amounts allocated to operating divisions increased primarily due to the implementation of new information technologyrelated projects and the consolidation of information technology support staff the costs of which were not being allocated back to operating divisions in 2004 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

cash flow overview 

 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased by 2344 to 19571 during 2006 primarily due to fees associated with capital market activity capital expenditures and working capital usage partially offset by improved operating results and proceeds from sales of investments of this change marketable securities decreased by 1142 a summary of our cash flow activities is as follows 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to improved operating results during 2006 partially offset by working capital usage of 2506 working capital usages reflects changes in accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients prepaid expenses and other current assets accounts payable and accrued liabilities media buying on behalf of our clients affects our working capital and operating cash flow in most of our businesses we collect funds from our clients which we use on their behalf to pay production costs and media costs the amounts involved substantially exceed our revenues and primarily impact the level of accounts receivable expenditures billable to clients accounts payable and accrued media and production liabilities in any given period for these passthrough arrangements our assets include both cash received and accounts receivable from clients for these passthrough arrangements while our liabilities include amounts owed on behalf of clients to media and production suppliers generally we pay production and media charges after we have received funds from our clients and our risk from client nonpayment has historically not been significant 

 

during 2006 a reduction in accounts payable of 3700 was partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable of 2354 the change in accounts payable includes a reduction of our vendor discount and credit liabilities established as part of the 2005 restatement of 736 of which 531 was satisfied through cash payments cash used by changes in accrued liabilities of 214 was primarily the result of higher accrued media liabilities offset by payments for professional fees primarily related to our prior year restatement activities accrued liabilities are also affected by the timing of certain payments for example while employee incentive awards are accrued throughout the year they are generally paid during the first quarter of the subsequent year 

 

the net loss of 317 during 2006 includes noncash items that are not expected to generate cash or require the use of cash net noncash expense items of 2944 primarily include the loss on early extinguishment of debt long lived asset impairment and other charges addback of depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of intangible assets restricted stock awards and noncash compensation bond discounts and deferred financing costs 

 

investing activities 

 

cash provided by investing activities during 2006 primarily reflects net maturities of shortterm marketable securities capital expenditures acquisitions and divestitures and purchases and sales of investments the cash flows attributable to shortterm marketable securities vary from one period to another because of changes in the 

 

the interpublic group of companies inc and subsidiaries management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

maturity profile of our treasury investments the net amount of these securities was 1938 lower as of december 31 2006 compared to december 31 2005 cash provided by investing activities was also impacted by capital expenditures of 1278 primarily related to computer hardware and leasehold improvements 

 

financing activities 

 

cash used in financing activities during 2006 reflects fees and costs of 901 that we incurred in connection with our financing transactions this includes fees of 418 and call spread costs of 292 for our new credit agreement and related transactions in the second quarter we incurred fees of 191 in the fourth quarter when we exchanged 4000 of our 450 convertible senior notes due 2023 for the same aggregate principal amount of our 425 convertible senior notes due 2023 and when we exchanged all of our 2500 floating rate notes due 2008 for the same aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2010 these costs are being amortized in interest expense in addition 35 of fees incurred as part of the floating rate note exchange were recorded in interest expense and will not be amortized 

 

cash used in financing activities also included dividend payments of 470 on our series a and series b preferred stock 

 

liquidity outlook 

 

we expect our operating cash flow cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements at a minimum for the next twelve months 

 

we believe that a conservative approach to liquidity is appropriate for our company in view of the cash requirements resulting from among other things high professional fees liabilities to our clients for vendor discounts and credits any potential penalties or fines that may have to be paid in connection with the ongoing sec investigation the normal cash variability inherent in our operations and other unanticipated requirements in addition until our margins consistently improve in connection with our turnaround cash generation from operations could be challenged in certain periods 

 

a reduction in our liquidity in future periods as a result of the above items or other business objectives could lead us to seek new or additional sources of liquidity to fund our working capital needs from time to time we evaluate market conditions and financing alternatives for opportunities to raise additional financing or otherwise improve our liquidity profile and enhance our financial flexibility there can be no guarantee that we would be able to access new sources of liquidity on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

 

funding requirements 

 

our most significant funding requirements include our operations noncancelable operating lease obligations capital expenditures payments related to vendor discounts and credits debt service preferred stock dividends contributions to pension and postretirement plans acquisitions and dispositions and taxes 

 

our noncancelable lease commitments primarily relate to office premises and equipment these commitments are partially offset by sublease rental income we receive under noncancelable subleases 

 

capital expenditures are primarily to upgrade computer and telecommunications systems and to modernize offices 

 

of the liabilities recognized as part of the 2005 restatement we estimate that we will pay approximately 1000 related to vendor discounts and credits internal investigations and international compensation arrangements over the next 12 months 

 

we have no significant scheduled amounts of longterm debt due until march 2008 when holders of our 4000 450 convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase the notes for cash at par 

 

the interpublic group of companies inc and subsidiaries management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — continued amounts in millions except per share amounts 

 

we pay annual dividends on each share of series b preferred stock in the amount of 5250 per share or 276 dividends on each share of series b preferred stock are payable quarterly in cash or if certain conditions are met in common stock at our option see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

 

we have not paid any dividends on our common stock since december of 2002 the terms of our series b preferred stock do not permit us to pay dividends on our common stock unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends on our series b preferred stock have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid or provision for the payment thereof has been made 

 

we make contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit plans throughout the year as determined using actuarial methods and assumptions for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 we made contributions of 427 and 341 respectively to our domestic and foreign pension plans for 2007 we do not anticipate making additional contributions to our domestic pension plans we expect to contribute an additional 206 to our foreign pension plans 

 

our capital requirements are affected by purchases and sales of agencies from time to time we contemplate acquisitions that may require payment in cash or stock in past years deferred payments related to past acquisitions were a significant funding requirement for us although these payments have decreased significantly in recent years as we have made fewer acquisitions under the contractual terms of certain of our past acquisitions we have longterm obligations to pay additional consideration or to purchase additional equity interests in certain consolidated or unconsolidated subsidiaries if specified conditions mostly relating to operating performance are met some of the consideration under these arrangements is in shares of our common stock but most is in cash for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we made cash payments related to past acquisitions of 229 970 and 1617 respectively in relation to our contingent acquisition obligations 78 53 and 201 were recorded as compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

 

we have various tax years under examination in various countries in which we have significant business operations we do not know whether these examinations will in the aggregate result in our paying additional income taxes which we believe are adequately reserved for 

 

financing and sources of funds 

 

substantially all of our operating cash flow is generated by our agencies our liquid assets are held primarily at the holding company level and to a lesser extent at our largest subsidiaries 

 

in recent years we have obtained longterm financing in the capital markets by issuing debt securities convertible debt securities and convertible preferred stock we have also used bank borrowing facilities to provide us with liquidity for working capital needs our outstanding longterm debt including convertible debt is detailed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements and our convertible preferred stock is detailed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements we also have two series of equity warrants outstanding we have entered into call spread transactions in connection with one of the series of equity warrants see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

in 2006 we engaged in several transactions to improve our liquidity and debt maturity profile

also in december 2006 each share of our series a preferred stock converted into 37037 shares of our common stock we issued a total of 277 shares of common stock to holders of the series a preferred stock as a result of this conversion future preferred stock dividend requirements will be lower 

 

elf financing 

 

under the credit agreement a specialpurpose entity called elf special financing ltd “elf” acts as the lender and letter of credit issuer elf is obligated at our request to make cash advances to us and to issue letters of credit for our account in an aggregate amount not to exceed 7500 outstanding at any time the aggregate face amount of letters of credit may not exceed 6000 at any time the credit agreement is a revolving facility under which amounts borrowed may be repaid and borrowed again and the aggregate available amount of letters of credit may decrease or increase subject to the overall limit of 7500 and the 6000 limit on letters of credit we have not drawn on the credit agreement or our previous committed credit agreements since late 2003 we are not subject to any financial or other material restrictive covenants under the credit agreement for additional information see notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

other credit facilities 

 

in addition to the credit agreement we have uncommitted credit facilities with various banks that permit borrowings at variable interest rates we use our uncommitted credit lines for working capital needs at some of our operations outside the united states there were borrowings under the uncommitted facilities made by several of our subsidiaries outside the united states totaling 803 and 537 as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively we have guaranteed the repayment of some of these borrowings by our subsidiaries if we lose access to these credit lines we would have to provide funding directly to some overseas operations the weightedaverage interest rate on outstanding balances under the uncommitted shortterm facilities as of december 31 2006 and 2005 was approximately 5 in each year 

 

letters of credit 

 

we are required from time to time to post letters of credit primarily to support our commitments or those of our subsidiaries to purchase media placements mostly in locations outside the united states or to satisfy other obligations these letters of credit are generally backed by letters of credit issued under the credit agreement the aggregate amount of outstanding letters of credit issued for our account under the credit agreement and our previous committed credit agreement was 2199 and 1624 as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively these letters of credit have historically not been drawn upon 

 

cash pooling 

 

we aggregate our net domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the united states we use cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements several interpublic agencies agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the agencies with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts the other agencies owe the bank and the bank provides overdrafts as long as the net balance for all the agencies does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each agency pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances our consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of overdrafts for each pooling arrangement as of december 31 2006 and 2005 a gross amount of 10525 and 8426 respectively in cash was netted against an equal gross amount of overdrafts under pooling arrangements

credit agency ratings 

 

our longterm debt credit ratings as of february 16 2007 were ba3 with negative outlook b creditwatch negative and b with negative outlook as reported by moody’s investors service standard  poor’s and fitch ratings respectively a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access capital and could result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new indebtedness 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following summarizes our estimated contractual obligations at december 31 2006 and their effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 

 

 

 

  

we have not included obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans in the contractual obligations table our funding policy regarding our funded pension plan is to contribute amounts necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirements plus such additional amounts from time to time as are determined to be appropriate to improve the plans’ funded status the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors including returns on invested assets level of market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans declines in longterm interest rates have had a negative impact on the funded status of the plans for 2007 we do not expect to contribute to our domestic pension plans and expect to contribute 206 to our foreign pension plans 

 

we have not included our deferred tax obligations in the contractual obligations table as the timing of any future payments in relation to these obligations is uncertain 

 

derivatives and hedging activities 

 

we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements and forward contracts to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to mitigate foreign exchange volatility in may of 2005 we terminated all of our longterm interest rate swap agreements covering the 3500 625 senior unsecured notes and 1500 of the 5000 725 senior unsecured notes in connection with the interest rate swap termination our net cash receipts were 11 which is recorded as an offset to interest expense over the remaining life of the related debt 

 

we have entered into foreign currency transactions in which various foreign currencies are bought or sold forward these contracts were entered into to meet currency requirements arising from specific transactions the changes in value of these forward contracts have been recorded in other income or expense as of december 31 2006 and 2005 we had contracts covering 02 and 62 respectively of notional amount of currency and the fair value of the forward contracts was negligible 

 

the terms of the 450 notes include two embedded derivative instruments and the terms of our 425 notes and our series b preferred stock each include one embedded derivative instrument the fair value of these derivatives on december 31 2006 was negligible

outofperiod amounts 

 

year ended december 31 2006 

 

during 2006 we recorded adjustments to certain vendor discounts and credits contractual liabilities foreign exchange tax and other miscellaneous items which related to prior periods for the year ended december 31 2006 these adjustments resulted in a net favorable impact to revenue of 91 a net favorable impact to salaries and related expenses of 51 a net unfavorable impact to office and general expenses of 66 and a net favorable impact to net loss of 69 the operating income impact of these adjustments primarily affected our ian segment because these changes are not material to our financial statements for the periods prior to 2006 for the quarters of 2006 or for 2006 as a whole we recorded these outofperiod amounts in their respective quarters of 2006 see also note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

three months ended december 31 2005 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2005 we recorded adjustments to certain vendor discounts and credits tax and other miscellaneous items which related to prior periods because these adjustments were not material to our financial statements for the periods prior to 2005 or for 2005 as a whole we have recorded them in the fourth quarter of 2005 

 

the following table details the impact these outofperiod amounts have on the results for the three months ended december 31 2005 compared to the three months ended december 31 2004 on a consolidated and segment basis 

 

 

 

internal control over financial reporting 

 

we have identified numerous material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as set forth in greater detail in item 8 management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and item 9a controls and procedures in this report each of our material weaknesses results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected as a result we have determined that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2006 

 

we are in the process of implementing remedial measures to address the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting we continue to have extensive work remaining to remediate our remaining material weaknesses the magnitude of the work is attributable partly to our decentralized structure and the number of disparate accounting systems of varying quality and sophistication we have developed a work plan with the goal of remediating all of the identified material weaknesses by the time we file our annual report on form 10k for the year ending december 31 2007 there can be no assurance however as to when the remediation plan will be fully implemented and all the material weaknesses remediated there also can be no assurance that new problems will not

other matters 

 

sec investigation 

 

the sec opened a formal investigation in response to the restatement we first announced in august 2002 and the investigation expanded to encompass the 2005 restatement set forth in our 2004 annual report on form 10k filed in september 2005 in particular since we filed our 2004 annual report on form 10k we have received subpoenas from the sec relating to matters addressed in our 2005 restatement we have also responded to inquiries from the sec staff concerning the restatement of the first three quarters of 2005 that we made in our 2005 annual report on form 10k we continue to cooperate with the investigation we expect that the investigation will result in monetary liability but because the investigation is ongoing in particular with respect to the 2005 restatement we cannot reasonably estimate the amount range of amounts or timing of a resolution accordingly we have not yet established any provision relating to these matters 

 

review of stock option practices 

 

during the third quarter of 2006 at our recommendation our audit committee retained independent counsel to review our stock option practices related to our current and prior senior officers for a 10year period beginning in 1996 we also performed a comprehensive accounting review that supplemented the review done by independent counsel these reviews were completed during the fourth quarter of 2006 based on these reviews in the third quarter of 2006 we recorded a charge of 264 to accumulated deficit a 233 credit to additional paidin capital and a 31 credit to other noncurrent liabilities see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risks related to interest rates and foreign currency rates from time to time we use derivatives pursuant to established guidelines and policies to manage some portion of these risks derivative instruments utilized in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 

 

interest rates 

 

our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations as of december 31 2006 and 2005 851 and 860 of our debt obligations bore interest at fixed interest rates accordingly assuming the fixedrate debt is not refinanced there would be no impact on interest expense or cash flow from either a 10 increase or decrease in market rates of interest however there would be an impact on the fair market value of the debt as the fair market value of debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates for 2006 the fair market value of the debt obligations would decrease by 288 if market rates were to increase by 10 and would increase by 295 if market rates were to decrease by 10 for 2005 the fair market value of the debt obligations would have decreased by 277 if market rates increased by 10 and would have increased by 280 if market rates decreased by 10 for that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable rates based on outstanding amounts and rates at december 31 2006 interest expense and cash outflow would increase or decrease by 23 if market rates were to increase or decrease by 10 respectively for that portion of the debt that bore interest at variable rates based on outstanding amounts and rates at december 31 2005 interest expense and cash outflow would have increased or decreased by 21 if market rates increased or decreased by 10 respectively interest rate swaps have been used to manage the mix of our fixed and floating rate debt obligations in may 2005 we terminated all our existing longterm interest rate swap agreements and currently have none outstanding 

 

foreign currencies 

 

we face translation and transaction risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders’ equity section of our consolidated balance sheet our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in currencies other than the us dollar mitigating transaction risk since the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the local currency foreign currency translation of the balance sheet is reflected as a component of stockholders’ equity and does not impact operating results since we report revenues and expenses in us dollars changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses as expressed in us dollars from foreign operations currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in results of operations and were not significant in the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 we have not entered into a material amount of foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

interpublic sold a business comprising the four motorsports circuits owned by its brands hatch circuits unit to motorsport vision limited for approximately 26 million the sale included the brands hatch oulton park cadwell park and snetterton racing tracks as a result of the sale interpublics remaining interest in motorsports consists of its obligations related to the formula one british grand prix and the lease of the silverstone track brands hatch circuits has therefore been renamed silverstone motorsport limited the sale of the four tracks does not affect interpublics interests and commitments in relation to silverstone including the remaining obligations under an executory contract and an operating lease see note 5 longlived asset impairment and other charges for further discussion revenue sources of revenue the company generates revenue from planning creating and placing advertising in various media and from planning and executing other communications or marketing programs historically the commission customary in the industry was 15 of the gross charge billings for advertising space or time more recently lower commissions have been negotiated but often with additional incentives paid for better performance for example an incentive component is frequently included in arrangements with clients based on improvements in an advertised brands awareness or image or increases in a clients sales or market share of the products or services being advertised under commission arrangements the media bill the company at their gross rates the company bills these amounts to its clients remits the net charges to the media and retains the balance as the companys commission many clients however prefer to compensate the company on a fee basis under which the company bills its client for the net charges billed by the media plus an agreedupon fee these fees usually are calculated to reflect the companys hourly rates and outofpocket expenses incurred on behalf of clients plus proportional overhead and a profit markup like other agencies the company is primarily responsible for paying the media with respect to firm contracts for advertising time or space placed on behalf of its clients the companys practice generally is to pay media charges only once the company has received funds from clients and in some instances the company agrees with the media that the company will be solely liable to pay the media only after the client has paid the company for the media charges the company makes serious efforts to reduce the risk from a clients nonpayment including by generally carrying out credit clearances and requiring in some cases payment by the media in advance the company also receives commissions from clients for planning and supervising work done by outside contractors in connection with the physical preparation of finished print advertisements and the production of television and radio commercials and other forms of advertising this commission is customarily 1765 of the outside contractors net charge which is the same as 15 of the outside contractors total charges including commission with the increasing use of negotiated fees the terms on which outstanding contractors charges are billed are subject to wide variations and even include in some instances the replacement of commissions with negotiated flat fees the company also derives revenue from other activities including the planning and placement with the media of advertising produced by unrelated advertising agencies the maintenance of specialized media placement facilities the creation and publication of brochures billboards point of sale materials and direct marketing pieces for clients the management of public relations campaigns the creation and management of special events meetings and shows at which clients products are featured and the design and implementation of interactive programs for special marketing needs clients the five clients that made the largest revenue contribution in 2003 accounted individually for approximately 18 to 83 of the companys revenue and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 174 of the companys revenue the companys twenty largest clients accounted for approximately 298 of its revenue in 2003 based on revenue as of december 31 2003 the companys largest clients included general motors corporation johnson  johnson microsoft nestle and unilever while the loss of the entire business of any one of the companys largest clients might have a material adverse effect upon its business the company believes that it is unlikely that the entire business of any of these clients would be lost at the same time because the company represents several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographical markets in each case through more than one of the companys agency systems representation of a client rarely means that the company handles advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from an agency within the company to a competing agency and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time the companys agencies have written contracts with many of their clients as is customary in the industry these contracts provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 90 days but sometimes shorter or longer in 2003 however 25 of revenue was derived from clients that had been associated with one or more of the companys agencies or their predecessors for 20 or more years personnel as of january 1 2004 the company employed approximately 43400 persons of whom 17900 were employed in the united states because of the personal service character of the marketing communications business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to the companys continuing success there is keen competition for qualified employees interpublic considers its employee relations to be satisfactory overall the company has several active programs for training personnel these programs include meetings and seminars throughout the world risk factors the following factors could adversely affect the companys revenues results of operations or financial condition see also statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure

 outlook the companys results of operations are dependent upon a maintaining and growing its revenue b the ability to retain and gain new clients c the continuous alignment of its costs to its revenue and d retaining and attracting key personnel revenue is also highly dependent on overall economic and political conditions for a discussion of these and other factors that could affect the companys results of operations and financial conditions see statement regarding forwardlooking disclosure and business  risk factors as discussed above 2003 was a difficult year for the company reflecting continued softness in worldwide demand for advertising and marketing communications services the decline in organic revenue versus the prior year was a decline of 36 for the full year however the company noted a positive trend in its revenues during the latter part of 2003 particularly internationally there was sequential improvement throughout the year as the organic revenue decline was 31 in the third quarter and 11 in the fourth quarter of 2003 in each case versus the prior year while management expects continued progress overall in the companys organic revenue trends it does not expect that the progression will be linear in particular given the cyclical nature of the companys business industry forecasters expect that there will continue to be signs of improving economic activity on a worldwide basis in 2004 specifically worldwide advertising and marketing services spending is expected to rise by 34 such a forecast confirms that while there is no certainty as to what will ultimately occur economic conditions in 2004 should continue to be better than 2003 for the industry as a whole the companys performance in the recent past has lagged somewhat that of the industry and may continue to do so management has responded to its recent performance issues however by implementing a turnaround program the program was begun in mid 2003 and is targeted to be complete by mid 2006 the first stage of the program has focused on implementing the restructuring initiatives discussed below and improving the companys capital structure going forward the turnaround program will focus on achieving certain defined performance objectives based on the companys perceived peer competitor performance levels the objectives include those relating to

the company derives organic revenue by adjusting reported revenue in respect of any given period by 

 additionally organic revenue calculations for the year ended and each quarter of 2003 have been adjusted to make 2003 organic revenue principally arising from public relations and sporting event arrangements more directly comparable to organic revenue arising from public relations and sporting event arrangements in periods preceding january 1 2003 and for the impact of the deconsolidation of certain international entities if these adjustments had been made to revenue for prior periods there would have been neither a material effect on results in prior periods nor any effect whatsoever on operating or net income these adjustments principally relate to grossing up revenues and expenses by the same amount in connection with the reimbursement of certain out of pocket expenses relating to public relations and sporting event arrangements management believes that discussing organic revenue giving effect to the above factors provides a better understanding of the companys revenue performance and trends than reported revenue because it allows for more meaningful comparisons of currentperiod revenue to that of prior periods management also believes that organic revenue determined on a generally comparable basis is a common measure of performance in the businesses in which it operates when the company discusses amounts on a constant currency basis the prior period results are adjusted to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the current period that is being compared to the prior period the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on prior period results is removed by converting the prior period results into us dollars at the average exchange rate for the current period management believes that discussing results on a constant currency basis allows for a more meaningful comparison of currentperiod results to such priorperiod results the company has also highlighted the impact of the loss of the chrysler account in the fourth quarter of 2000 revenue and operating expenses related to which continued through 2001 chrysler was a major client of true north communications inc true north which the company acquired in a transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests in june 2001 as a result of the acquisition of true north the company lost accounts of pepsiowned brands due to client conflicts within the combined company management believes that adjusting for the impact of these significant client losses is relevant when comparing organic revenue performance between 2002 and 2001 as discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the company is comprised of two reportable segments the interpublic sports and entertainment group seg and interpublic excluding seg seg was formed during the second quarter of 2002 through a carveout from the companys other operating groups and is primarily comprised of the operations of oww for the companys sports marketing business motorsports for the companys motorsports business and jack morton worldwide for specialized marketing services including corporate events meeting and traininglearning seg revenue is not material to the company as a whole however due to the recording of longlived asset impairment charges operating difficulties and resulting higher costs principally from its motorsports business seg has incurred significant operating losses based on certain substantial contractual obligations and revised projections for oww the company does not expect that margins of seg will converge with those of the rest of the company and accordingly reports seg as a separate reportable segment other than the impairment charges which are discussed below and the commitments discussed in other matters the operating results of seg are not material to those of the company and therefore are not discussed in detail below

sfas 109 requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized in circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence establishment of a valuation allowance must be considered the company believes that cumulative losses in the most recent three year period represent sufficient negative evidence to consider a valuation allowance under the provisions of sfas 109 as a result the company determined that certain of its deferred tax assets required the establishment of a valuation allowance the deferred tax assets for which an allowance was established relate primarily to foreign net operating and us capital loss carryforwards during 2003 a valuation allowance of 539 was established in continuing operations on existing deferred tax assets in addition 268 of valuation allowances were established in continuing operations for current year losses incurred in jurisdictions where a benefit is not currently expected and 37 of valuation allowances were established in continuing operations for certain us capital and other loss carryforwards the realization of the remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on forecasted future taxable income any reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income including but not limited to any future restructuring activities may require that we record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance has not previously been established the valuation allowance that has been established will be maintained until there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized an ongoing pattern of profitability will generally be considered as sufficient positive evidence our income tax expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance the establishment and reversal of valuation allowances could have a significant negative or positive impact on our future earnings valuation of longlived and intangible assets and investments the company has a significant amount of longlived assets including fixed assets investments goodwill and other intangibles the company periodically evaluates the realizability of all of its longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable goodwill

in the third quarter of each year as of september 30 the company formally evaluates the realizability of its goodwill and other intangibles using discounted cash flow projections the company has used the september 30 date since the adoption of sfas 142 such projections require the use of estimates and assumptions as to matters such as future revenue growth product margins capital expenditures assumed tax rates and discount rates such projections are prepared for each reporting unit as defined in sfas 142 management believes that the estimates and assumptions made are reasonable to the extent that the company has incorrectly estimated the revenue growth andor product margin assumptions in the calculations the goodwill related to certain reporting units may be determined to be unrealizable and an impairment charge may have to be recorded the company believes that the accounting estimates relating to potential goodwill and other intangible impairments are a critical accounting estimate because i they are susceptible to change from period to period and ii they require the company to make assumptions about future forecast growth rates in 2003 and 2002 as a result of the impairment analyses conducted above total charges related to goodwill impairment of 2210 and 821 respectively were recorded in the income statement this was due to the fact that expectations for future earnings from the oww and motorsports reporting units would not be sufficient to recover any of the goodwill of the reporting unit see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further information investments the company regularly reviews its cost and equity investments where market value has declined below cost to determine whether there has been an other than temporary decline in market value for investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting management evaluates information eg budgets business plans financial statements etc in addition to quoted market price if any in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of the investment this list is not all inclusive and management weighs all known quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred

the company recorded noncash impairment charges of 849 397 and 2108 in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the company considers that future impairment charges may be necessary based on the factors above but anticipates that these would not be as significant as in prior years fixed assets for fixed assets accounting standards require that if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a companys asset grouping undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the reported value of the asset an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements the amount of the impairment recognized is calculated by subtracting the imputed fair value as calculated above from the reported value of the asset as discussed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements there were significant longlived assets held at motorsports the remaining assets as of december 31 2003 were sold in a transaction that occurred in january 2004 an impairment charge of 380 was recorded in 2003 to reduce the company value of these assets to their realizable value future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with a given operation have become impaired any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on the companys financial condition and results of operations accounting for business combinations the company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair market values goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair market values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets at the date of acquisition determining the fair market value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including among others assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items the company has significant future deferred payments earn outs that generally tie the aggregate price ultimately paid for an acquisition to its performance over a period of time such payments are recorded within the financial statements once the payment of such earn outs is probable and estimable and when any contractual contingencies have been met the company has policies and procedures in place to determine if such payments relate to the acquisition and should be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired or should be expensed as compensation payments these policies include reviewing the acquisition agreements and employment terms of former owners of the acquired businesses the total amount that is anticipated to be settled in cash and stock is estimated to be 2060 of which 1278 relates to payments due in 2004 the actual amounts to be paid are contingent upon the achievement of projected operating performance targets generally over a three or four year period and satisfying other conditions as specified in the relevant agreements other matters sec investigation the company was informed in january 2003 by the securities and exchange commission staff that the sec has issued a formal order of investigation related to the companys restatements of earnings for periods dating back to 1997 the matters had previously been the subject of an informal inquiry the company is cooperating fully with the investigation other contingencies the company continues to have commitments under certain leasing and motorsports event contractual arrangements at the silverstone circuit as of december 31 2003 the company is committed to remaining payments under these arrangements of approximately 460 this amount relates to undiscounted payments through 2015 principally under an executory contract and an operating lease and assumes payments over the maximum remaining term of the relevant agreements this estimated amount has not been reduced by any future revenues to be generated from the arrangements the company is continuing to explore various options with respect to these commitments at least one of which may involve a cash disbursement in the order of 200 the company has obtained amendments of

 outlook the companys results of operations are dependent upon a maintaining and growing its revenue b the ability to gain new clients c the continuous alignment of its costs to its revenue and d retaining key personnel revenue is also highly dependent on overall economic conditions as discussed above 2001 was a very difficult year for the company during the year spending by clients on most marketing services was reduced and the reduction was felt worldwide while most of the reduction was due to general recessionary conditions the marketing industry was particularly hard hit as clients many of whom seemed to have been surprised by the suddenness of the recession looked to their advertising and marketing budgets for the quickest cuts thus the drop in demand for services in our industry was more severe than that noted in the overall economy the company has taken steps to improve its operating performance and to bring its cost structure in line with the current revenue environment the restructuring program announced in the third quarter of 2001 has already begun to yield significant cost savings the annualized savings from the plan are expected to exceed 250 as of december 2001 the companys headcount has been reduced from approximately 62000 at december 31 2000 to 54100 primarily due to the restructuring program results of operations during the fourth quarter of 2002 the company identified total charges of 470 353 net of tax in addition to total asset impairment and other charges of 1187 that related to the three months ended september 30 2002 that are related to prior periods from january 1 1997 through september 30 2002 of this amount 238 178 net of tax was related to periods prior to and including december 31 2001 the 238 of charges has been recorded through a restatement of previously recorded amounts in this form 10 ka the total amount of charges of 238 includes amounts related to inappropriate purchase accounting adjustments compensation costs that had been deferred instead of being expensed charges to straight line certain longterm contracts and other items december 2002 restatement during the second and third quarters of 2002 the company identified total charges of 1813 1359 net of tax that were related to prior periods in december 2002 the company restated its financial statements for periods up to and including june 30 2002 the amounts described within this document as previously reported reflect the amounts restated in december 2002 as a result of a review undertaken surrounding the process of internally allocating certain overhead costs and reimbursable charges to operating units throughout the world the company identified and recorded 1010 of intracompany charges the review related to mccannerikson worldgroup mccann cost allocations are performed by mccann in order to among other things satisfy regulatory authorities and measure client account profitability the charges were principally in europe and had been included in accounts receivable and work in progress rather than being expensed 

the interpublic group of companies inc and its subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions except per share amounts 

in addition to the intracompany charges the company identified an additional 363 at mccann principally related to estimates of insurance proceeds not yet realized specific writeoffs of receivables and work in progress costs that had been capitalized rather than expensed and other items an additional 440 at subsidiaries other than mccann was identified the largest component of the total was 303 related to understated liabilities which the company has concluded date back to 1996 and prior at a subsidiary within the partnership the understated liabilities were identified as a result of the company changing a subsidiary ledger system additionally the company identified 87 related to revenue and cost recognition adjustments at a subsidiary of interpublic sports and entertainment group in december 2002 the company restated its financial statements for periods up to and including june 30 2002 the amounts described within this document as previously reported reflect the amounts restated in december 2002 subsequent events octagon motorsports oms impairment  oms owns and leases certain racing circuit facilities that are used for automobile motorcycle and gocart racing primarily in the united kingdom beginning in the second quarter of 2002 and continuing in subsequent quarters certain of the octagon businesses experienced significant operational difficulties including significantly lower than anticipated attendance at the marquee british grand prix race in july 2002 these events and a change in management at oms in the third quarter of 2002 led the company to begin assessing its longterm strategy for oms in accordance with the sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets the company prepared a valuation of oms to assess its fair value for this purpose the company used a valuation method based on the valuations of comparable publicly traded entities this method was considered by management to be the most appropriate one to value oms and based on the results of this analysis the company concluded that no impairment charge was required at september 30 2002 throughout the fourth quarter of 2002 the company continued to assess various strategic alternatives for the oms business in order to assist in evaluating strategic alternatives the company prepared a discounted cash flow analysis which indicated that the book value of oms significantly exceeded its estimated fair value and that a goodwill impairment had occurred as part of this process the company reassessed its third quarter valuation and its key assumptions and concluded that the impairment charge should have been recorded in the third quarter of 2002 in addition as a result of the goodwill analysis the company assessed whether there had been an impairment of the companys longlived assets in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets the company concluded that the book value of certain asset groupings at oms was significantly higher than their expected future cash flows and that an impairment had occurred accordingly the company has recognized a noncash impairment and related charge of 1187 838 net of tax as of september 30 2002 through a restatement of previously recorded results for that period the charges included 821 of goodwill impairment 246 of fixed asset writeoffs and 120 to record the fair value of an associated put option subsequent to the third quarter management has determined that its original operating plans were no longer feasible and decided to explore options to exit some or all of these businesses the remaining book value of longlived assets relating to oms is approximately 73 at september 30 2002 and this amount as well as other substantial contractual obligations may not be fully recoverable depending upon the exit strategy ultimately followed in addition oms is contractually required to upgrade and improve certain of its existing facilities over the next 2 years these capital expenditures amount to approximately 38 and are expected to be impaired as incurred based on current cash flow analysis for the relevant asset groupings other items see note 18 for a discussion of certain liquidity matters and amendments under credit agreements

market share of the products or services being advertised under commission arrangements media bill the company at their gross rates the company bills these amounts to its clients remits the net charges to media and retains the balance as its commission some clients however prefer to compensate the company on a fee basis under which the company bills its client for the net charges billed by the media plus an agreedupon fee these fees usually are calculated to reflect the companys hourly rates and outofpocket expenses incurred on behalf of clients plus proportional overhead and a profit markup like other agencies the company is primarily responsible for paying media with respect to firm contracts for advertising time or space placed on behalf of its clients the primary risk to the company posed by this practice is the potential inability of the client to reimburse the company because of insolvency or bankruptcy the company makes significant efforts to reduce this risk including by carrying out credit clearances requiring in some cases payment of media in advance or agreeing with media that the company will be liable to pay the media only after the client has paid the company for the media charges the company also receives commissions from clients for planning and supervising work done by outside contractors in connection with the physical preparation of finished print advertisements and the production of television and radio commercials and other forms of advertising this commission is customarily 1765 of the outside contractors net charge which is equal to 150 of the outside contractors total charges including commission with the increasing use of negotiated fees the terms on which outstanding contractors charges are billed are subject to wide variations and even include in some instances the replacement of commissions with negotiated flat fees the company also derives revenue from other activities including the planning and placement in media of advertising produced by unrelated advertising agencies the maintenance of specialized media placement facilities the creation and publication of brochures billboards point of sale materials and direct marketing pieces for clients the planning and carrying out of specialized marketing research the management of public relations campaigns the creation and management of special events meetings and shows at which clients products are featured and the design and implementation of interactive programs for special marketing needs clients the five clients that made the largest revenue contribution in 2001 accounted individually for approximately 15 to 67 of the companys revenue and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 14 of the companys revenue twenty of the companys clients accounted for approximately 25 of its revenue based on 2001 revenue the companys largest clients currently include cocacola general motors corporation johnson  johnson general motors corporation first became a client of one of the companys agencies in the united states in 1916 predecessors of several of the lowe  partners agencies have supplied advertising services to unilever since 1893 the companys client relationship with nestle began in 1940 in argentina while the loss of the entire business of one of the companys largest clients might have a material adverse effect upon the business of the company the company believes that it is very unlikely that the entire business of any of these clients would be lost at the same time because it represents several different brands or divisions of each of these clients in a number of geographical markets in each case through more than one of the companys agency systems representation of a client rarely means that the company handles advertising for all brands or product lines of the client in all geographical locations any client may transfer its business from an agency within our company to a competing agency and a client may reduce its marketing budget at any time the companys agencies have written contracts with many of their clients as is customary in the industry these contracts typically provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice usually 90 days but sometimes shorter or longer in 2001 however 19 of revenue was derived from clients that had been associated with one or more of the companys agencies or their predecessors for 20 or more years personnel as of january 1 2002 the company employed approximately 54100 persons of whom 21500 were employed in the united states because of the personal service character of the marketing communications business the quality of personnel is of crucial importance to the companys continuing success there is keen competition for qualified employees interpublic considers its employee relations to be satisfactory overall the company has several active programs for training personnel these programs include meetings and seminars throughout the world competition and other factors one of the business strategies of the company is to acquire businesses that complement and expand the companys current business capabilities accordingly the company is usually engaged in evaluating potential acquisition candidates the company is frequently engaged in a number of preliminary discussions that may result in one or more substantial acquisitions these acquisition opportunities require confidentiality and from time to time give rise to bidding scenarios that require quick responses by the company although there is uncertainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transactions the announcement of any such transaction may lead to increased volatility in the trading price of the companys securities moreover the success of recent or contemplated future acquisitions will depend on the effective integration of newlyacquired businesses into the current operations of the company important factors for integration include realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings and the ability to retain and attract new personnel and clients the advertising agency and other marketing communications and marketing services businesses are highly competitive the companys agencies and media services must compete with other agencies and with other providers of creative or media services which are not themselves advertising agencies in order to maintain existing client relationships and to obtain new clients competition in the advertising agency business depends to a large extent on the clients perception of the quality of an agencys creative product and strategic input an agencys ability to serve clients particularly large international clients on a broad geographic basis is also an important competitive consideration on the other hand because an agencys principal asset is its people freedom of entry into the business is almost unlimited and quite small agencies are on occasion able to take all or some portion of a clients account from a much larger competitor moreover increasing size may limit an agencys potential for securing new business because many clients prefer not to be represented by an agency that represents a direct competitor also clients frequently wish to have different products represented by different agencies the companys ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may in some cases be limited by clients policies on or perceptions of conflicts of interest these policies can in some cases prevent one agency and in limited circumstances different agencies within the same holding company from performing similar services for competing products or companies in addition these perceived conflicts following an acquisition by the company of an agency or company can result in clients terminating their relationship with the company or reducing the number or scope of projects for which they retain those agencies moreover after the true north acquisition and the resulting larger number of clients there could be a greater likelihood of conflicts with potential new clients in the future if the combined company fails to maintain existing clients or attract new clients its business may be materially and adversely impacted employees including creative research media account and practice group specialists and their skills and relationships with clients are among our most important assets an important aspect of the companys competitiveness is its ability to retain employee and management personnel the companys inability to hire and retain these employees in the future may have a material adverse effect on the company advertising and marketing communications businesses are subject to government regulation both domestic and foreign there has been some increasing tendency in the united states on the part of advertisers to resort to the courts and industry and selfregulatory bodies to challenge comparative advertising on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive through the years there has been a continuing expansion of specific rules prohibitions media restrictions labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products representatives within certain government bodies both domestic and foreign continue to initiate proposals to ban the advertising of specific products and to impose taxes on or deny deductions for advertising which if successful may have an adverse effect on advertising expenditures and consequently interpublics revenues the companys international operations are exposed to certain risks which affect foreign operations of all kinds such as local legislation monetary devaluation exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions in addition international advertising agencies are subject to ownership restrictions in certain countries because they are considered an integral factor in the communications process statement regarding forward looking disclosure this annual report on form 10k including business competition and other factors and managements discussion

revenue


     the  company  generates   revenue  from  planning   creating  and  placing
advertising   in  various   media  and  from   planning  and   executing   other
communications or marketing programs  historically the commission customary in
the industry was 15 of the gross charge  billings for advertising  space or
time  more recently  lower  commissions  have been  negotiated  but often with
additional  incentives paid for better  performance  for example  an incentive
component  is  frequently   included  in  arrangements  with  clients  based  on
improvements  in an  advertised  brands  awareness or image  or increases in a
clients  sales or market  share of the products or services  being  advertised
under commission arrangements  media bill the company at their gross rates the
company bills these amounts to its clients  remits the net charges to the media
and retains the balance as its  commission  some  clients  however  prefer to
compensate the company on a fee basis  under which the company bills its client
for the net  charges  billed by the media plus an  agreedupon  fee  these fees
usually are calculated to reflect the companys  hourly rates and  outofpocket
expenses  incurred on the  clients  behalf  plus  proportional  overhead and a
profit markup

     normally  the company  like other agencies  is primarily responsible for
paying the media with respect to firm  contracts for  advertising  time or space
placed on its clients behalf this is a problem only if the client is unable to
pay the company  because of insolvency or bankruptcy  the company makes serious
efforts to reduce the risk from a clients  insolvency  including  1 carrying
out credit clearances  2 requiring in some cases payment of media in advance
or 3 agreeing with the media that the company will be solely liable to pay the
media only after the client has paid the company for the media charges

     the  company  also  receives  commissions  from  clients for  planning  and
supervising  work done by outside  contractors  in the physical  preparation  of
finished  print  advertisements  and the  production  of  television  and  radio
commercials  and other forms of  advertising  this  commission  is  customarily
1765 of the outside contractors net charge which is the same as 150 of the
outside contractors total charges including  commission  with the expansion of
negotiated fees the terms on which outstanding  contractors charges are billed
are  subject  to  wide  variations  and  even  include  in  some  instances  the
elimination of commissions entirely provided that there are adequate negotiated

     the company also derives revenue in many other ways including the planning
and  placement  in  media  of  advertising  produced  by  unrelated  advertising
agencies  the  maintenance  of  specialized  media  placement  facilities  the
creation and publication of brochures  billboards  point of sale materials and
direct  marketing  pieces  for  clients   the  planning  and  carrying  out  of
specialized  marketing  research  public  relations  campaigns   creating  and
managing special events at which clients  products are featured  and designing
and carrying out interactive programs for special uses

     the five clients of the company that made the largest revenue  contribution
in 2000 accounted  individually for  approximately  16 to 73 of such revenue
and in the  aggregate  accounted  for over  approximately  15 of such  revenue
twenty clients of the company  accounted for  approximately 26 of such revenue
based on revenue  the five  largest  clients of the company are general  motors
corporation  nestle  unilever  and  johnson  johnson and  cocacola  general
motors  corporation  first became a client of one of the  companys  agencies in
1916 in the united states  predecessors  of several of the lintas agencies have
supplied  advertising  services to unilever since 1893 the client  relationship
with nestle began in 1940 in argentina while the loss of the entire business of
one of the companys five largest  clients might have a material  adverse effect
upon the business of the company  the company believes that it is very unlikely
that the entire business of any of these clients would be lost at the same time
because it  represents  several  different  brands or divisions of each of these
clients in a number of geographical markets  in each case through more than one
of the companys agency systems

     representation   of  a  client  rarely  means  that  the  company   handles
advertising  for all brands or product  lines of the client in all  geographical
locations  any client  may  transfer  its  business  from an agency  within the
company to a competing  agency  and a client may reduce its marketing budget at
any time

     the companys  agencies in many instances have written contracts with their
clients  as  is  customary  in  the  industry   these  contracts  provide  for
termination  by either party on  relatively  short  notice  usually 90 days but
sometimes shorter or longer in 2000  however  21 of revenue was derived from
clients that had been associated  with one or more of the companys  agencies or
their predecessors for 20 or more years

personnel


     as of january 1 2001 the company employed  approximately  48200 persons
of whom  nearly  20100  were  employed  in the  united  states  because of the
personal service character of the marketing communications business the quality
of personnel  is of crucial  importance  to  continuing  success  there is keen
competition  for  qualified  employees   interpublic   considers  its  employee
relations to be satisfactory

     the  company  has an active  program for  training  personnel  the program
includes  meetings and seminars  throughout the world it also involves training
personnel in its offices in new york and in its larger offices worldwide

competition and other factors


     the  advertising  agency and other marketing  communications  and marketing
services  businesses are highly  competitive  the companys  agencies and media
services must compete with other  agencies and with other  providers of creative
or media  services which are not themselves  advertising  agencies  in order to
maintain existing client relationships and to obtain new clients competition in
the  advertising  agency  business  depends  to a large  extent on the  clients
perception of the quality of an agencys creative product an agencys ability
to  serve  clients   particularly  large  international  clients  on  a  broad
geographic basis is also an important  competitive  consideration  on the other
hand because an agencys  principal asset is its people  freedom of entry into
the business is almost unlimited and quite small agencies are on occasion able
to take all or some portion of a clients account from a much larger competitor

     moreover  increasing size bring some limitations to an agencys  potential
for securing new business  because many clients prefer not to be represented by
an agency that represents a competitor  also  clients  frequently wish to have
different products represented by different agencies  the fact that the company
owns two separate  worldwide  agency systems and interests in other  advertising
agencies gives it additional competitive opportunities

     the  advertising  and  marketing  communications  businesses  is subject to
government  regulation  both domestic and foreign there has been an increasing
tendency  in the  united  states  on the part of  advertisers  to  resort to the
courts industry and selfregulatory bodies to challenge comparative advertising
on the grounds that the  advertising is false and deceptive  through the years
there has been a continuing  expansion of specific  rules  prohibitions  media
restrictions  labeling disclosures and warning requirements with respect to the
advertising  for certain  products  representatives  within certain  government
bodies  both  domestic and foreign  continue to initiate  proposals to ban the
advertising of specific  products and to impose taxes on or deny  deductions for
advertising  which  if  successful  may have an adverse  effect on advertising
expenditures

     the international operations of the company still remain exposed to certain
risks which affect foreign  operations of all kinds such as local  legislation
monetary  devaluation  exchange  control  restrictions  and unstable  political
conditions in addition international advertising agencies are still subject to
ownership  restrictions  in certain  countries  because they are  considered  an
integral factor in the communications process

statement regarding forward looking disclosure


     certain  sections of this report  including  business  competition and
other factors and managements  discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations contain forward looking statements  concerning future
events and developments  that involve risks and  uncertainties  including those
associated  with the effect of national and regional  economic  conditions  the
ability of the company to attract new clients and retain existing  clients  the
financial  success of clients of the company  other  developments of clients of
the  company  and  developments  from  changes  in  the  regulatory  and  legal
